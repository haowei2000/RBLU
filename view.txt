"<bos><start_of_turn>user\n[Australia] Can Americans from America and as American as apple pie, own houses in Washington D.C?.I'm asking since in the Australian Capital Territory citizens don't purchase property per se, they can only buy leases to the land that last up to 99 years. Once the leases expire, you've got to purchase the lease again.\n\nSince Canberra and Washington D.C were both planned capitals of interstatual colonial federations, I'm wondering if and how the property laws differ (or if they're the same).<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n"
