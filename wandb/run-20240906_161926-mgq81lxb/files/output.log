The `process_query` function checks if the input contains common greetings like "hi", "hello", or "hey".

predictions: ["Creating a basic virtual assistant using NLP and the `spacy` library involves several steps:\n\n1. **Install and Import Necessary Libraries**: First, ensure you have `spacy` installed. You can install it via pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install spacy\n   ```\n   Then, you might need to download specific language models depending on the languages you want to support.\n\n2. **Load the Language Model**: Load the language model you need for your assistant. For English, this could be 'en_core_web_sm'.\n\n   ```python\n   import spacy\n\n   nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\n   ```\n\n3. **Define the Assistant's Functionality**: Decide what tasks your assistant will perform. Common tasks include answering questions, providing information, or executing commands.\n\n4. **Create a Function to Process User Input**: This function will take user input, process it with `spacy`, and return a response based on the intent and entities identified.\n\n   ```python\n   def respond_to_user_input(user_input):\n       doc = nlp(user_input)\n       # Here you would parse the doc to understand the intent and entities\n       # For simplicity, let's assume we just return a greeting\n       if any(token.text", "There are several ways to sort a list of numbers in descending order in Python. Here are some common methods:\n\n1. Using the `sort()` method with the `reverse` parameter:\n```python\nnumbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]\nnumbers.sort(reverse=True)\nprint(numbers)  # Output: [9, 8, 5, 2, 1]\n```\n\n2. Using the `sorted()` function with the `reverse` parameter:\n```python\nnumbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)\nprint(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [9, 8, 5, 2, 1]\n```\n\n3. Using the `list.reverse()` method after sorting in ascending order:\n```python\nnumbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]\nnumbers.sort()\nnumbers.reverse()\nprint(numbers)  # Output: [9, 8, 5, 2, 1]\n```\n\n4. Using the `heapq` module's `nlargest()` function:\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nnumbers = [5, 2, 8, 1,"]
