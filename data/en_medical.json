If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","answer":"hello and thank you for using chatbot. i carefully read your question and i understand your concern. i will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 \/ 90 mmhg. a person might have high value during emotional and physicals trees so it's mandatory to judge on mean values. usaly hypertension does not give any symptoms but left untreated he slowly modifies the heart. according to heart rhythm, the normal rate is between 50-100 beat for minute. when it exceeds 100 we talk about sinus tachycardia. this might have different causes to simple emotional stress, physical activity, coffee consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism. so if we diagnose hypertension and rhythm issue we have to find they cause and of course treat them. if you treat the hypertension than you have nothing to worry. if i was your treating doctor i will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo, a full blood analyze, a holder rhythm and pressure monitoring. this gives a better view how to treat the problem, medical or not. but as you catch values up to 170 i think medical treatment is necessary. hope i was helpful. wish you good health. best regards."}

However, moderate DJD to L5-S1, which is new, as well as small DJD at all other levels, and normal post op scaring at nerve root areas. treating, at this time, with pain meds for back pain and neurontin for nerve pain, however, not helping significantly. I am an otherwise healthy 45 yo female who sustained a traumatic injury resulting in this problem. what is likelihood of further surgery at this time? pre and post op we discussed probability of further surgery at some time, as no one wanted to do a 4 level fusion, which really was what I needed. We all agreed due to age, it was a poor choice to do 4 levels with initial surgery. If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","answer":"dear madam, thank you for your consultation.it seems that after a fusion operation at l23 and l34 it is still painful while maintaining your daily life. with keeping in mind your age and extent of damage done by trauma i think you should not go for a 4 level fusion. because a second surgery like 4 level after an initial spinal fusion surgery does not necessarily yield any good result. rather you should try some light back strengthening exercise under the supervision of a physiotherapist to get some relief from pain. this will partially overcome the apparent need of 4 level fusion surgery.my best wishes for your health in coming days. thank you."}

{"question":"Airborne viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are partly spreading through aerosols containing viral particles. Inhalation of infectious airborne particles can lead to infection, a route that can even be more predominant compared with droplet or contact transmission. To study the transmission between a susceptible and an infected person, we estimate the distribution of arrival times of small diffusing aerosol particles to the inhaled region located below the nose until the number of particles reaches a critical threshold. Our results suggest that although contamination by continuous respiration can take around 90 minutes at a distance of one meter, it is reduced to a few minutes when coughing or sneezing. Interestingly, there is not much differences between outdoors and indoors when the air is still. When a window is open inside an office, the infection time is reduced. Finally, wearing a mask leads to a delay in the time to infection. To conclude, diffusion analysis provides several key time scale of viral airborne transmission.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Of 308 kidney transplant recipients included, only 112 (36.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies 2-4 weeks after receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Median antibody titer was 15.5 AU\/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 3.5-163.6). Factors associated with antibody response were higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio [OR] 1.025 per ml\/min\/1.73m(2), 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.014 - 1.037, p<0.001), lower mycophenolic acid dose (OR 2.347 per 360 mg decrease, 95% CI 1.782 - 3.089, p<0.001), younger age (OR 1.032 per year decrease, 95% CI 1.015 - 1.05, p<0.001) and lower calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) blood level (OR 1.987, 95% CI 1.146 - 3.443, p=0.014). No serious adverse events to the vaccine were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients demonstrated inadequate antibody response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Immunosuppression level was a significant factor in this response. Strategies to improve immunogenicity should be examined in future studies.

{"question":"What is forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and how is it related to the volume of air that can be forcibly expired after a maximal inspiration? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a measure of lung function that represents the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after a maximal inspiration. It is used to assess the severity of respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The volume of air that can be forcibly expired after a maximal inspiration is directly related to the FEV1, as a higher FEV1 indicates better lung function and a greater ability to exhale air quickly."}

{"question":"Microbiome composition data collected through amplicon sequencing are count data on taxa in which the total count per sample (the library size) is an artefact of the sequencing platform and as a result such data are compositional. To avoid library size dependency, one common way of analyzing multivariate compositional data is to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on data transformed with the centered log-ratio, hereafter called a log-ratio PCA. Two aspects typical of amplicon sequencing data are the large differences in library size and the large number of zeroes. In this paper we show on real data and by simulation that, applied to data that combines these two aspects, log-ratio PCA is nevertheless heavily dependent on the library size. This leads to a reduction in power when testing against any explanatory variable in log-ratio redundancy analysis. If there is additionally a correlation between the library size and the explanatory variable, then the type 1 error becomes inated. We explore putative solutions to this problem.

{"question":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 provided the impetus for unprecedented adoption of telemedicine. This study aimed to understand video visit adoption by plastic surgery providers; and patient and surgeon perceptions about its efficacy, value, accessibility, and long-term viability. A secondary aim was to develop the proposed 'Triage Tool for Video Visits in Plastic Surgery' to help determine visit video eligibility. METHODS: This mixed-methods evaluation assessed provider-level scheduling data from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Stanford Health Care to quantify telemedicine adoption and semi-structured phone interviews with patients (n = 20) and surgeons (n = 10) to explore stakeholder perspectives on video visits. RESULTS: During the 13-week period after the local stay-at-home orders due to coronavirus disease 2019, 21.4% of preoperative visits and 45.5% of postoperative visits were performed via video. Video visits were considered acceptable by patients and surgeons in plastic surgery in terms of quality of care but were limited by the inability to perform a physical examination. Interviewed clinicians reported that long-term viability needs to be centered around technology (eg, connection, video quality, etc) and physical examinations. Our findings informed a proposed triage tool to determine the appropriateness of video visits for individual patients that incorporates visit type, anesthesia, case, surgeon's role, and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: Video technology has the potential to facilitate and improve preoperative and postoperative patient care in plastic surgery but the following components are needed: patient education on taking high-quality photos; standardized clinical guidelines for conducting video visits; and an algorithm-assisted triage tool to support scheduling.

{"question":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic researchers looked for evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in feces dissolved in wastewater samples to assess levels of infection across communities. This activity is known colloquially as sewer monitoring and called wastewater-based epidemiology in academic settings. When used for public health surveillance in the United States, wastewater monitoring is not regulated, although general ethical principles have been described. Prior to this study, no nationwide data existed regarding the public's perceptions of wastewater being used for community health monitoring. Using an online survey distributed to a representative sample of adults in the Unites States (N=3,083), we investigated the public's perceptions regarding what is monitored, where monitoring occurs, and privacy concerns related to wastewater monitoring as a public health surveillance tool. Further, the Privacy Attitudes Questionnaire assessed respondents' general privacy boundaries. The results suggest that respondents supported using wastewater for health monitoring, but within some bounds. Participants were most likely to support or strongly support monitoring for disease (95%), environmental toxins (94%), and terroristic threats (90%, e.g., anthrax). Two-thirds of respondents endorsed no prohibition to locations being monitored while the most common category of location respondents wanted to be prohibited from monitoring was personal residencies. Additionally, the findings suggest that those younger in age and living in an urban area were more supportive of wastewater monitoring, compared to older, suburban dwellers.

{"question":"Inflammation is an obligatory marker of arterial disease, both stemming from the inflammatory activity of cholesterol itself and from well-established molecular mechanisms. Raised progenitor cell recruitment after major events and clonal hematopoiesis related mechanisms have provided an improved understanding of factors regulating inflammatory phenomena. Trials with inflammation antagonists have led to an extensive evaluation of biomarkers such as the high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), not exerting a causative role, but frequently indicative of the individual cardiovascular (CV) risk. Aim of this review is to provide indication on the anti-inflammatory profile of agents of general use in CV prevention, i.e. affecting lipids, blood pressure, diabetes as well nutraceuticals such as n-3 fatty acids. A crucial issue in the evaluation of the benefit of the anti-inflammatory activity is the frequent discordance between a beneficial activity on a major risk factor and associated changes of hsCRP, as in the case of statins vs PCSK9 antagonists. In hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors exert an optimal anti-inflammatory activity, vs the case of sartans. The remarkable preventive activity of SLGT-2 inhibitors in heart failure is not associated with a clear anti-inflammatory mechanism. Finally, icosapent ethyl has been shown to reduce the CV risk in hypertriglyceridemia, with a 27% reduction of hsCRP. The inflammation-based approach to arterial disease has considerably gained from an improved understanding of the clinical diagnostic strategy and from a better knowledge on the mode of action of numerous agents, including nutraceuticals.

{"question":"What is the function of Tat, a protein found in HIV? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Tat is a regulatory protein found in HIV that plays a crucial role in the replication of the virus. Specifically, Tat is responsible for transcriptionally activating other viral genes, which allows the virus to replicate and spread throughout the body. Without Tat, HIV would not be able to efficiently replicate and infect new cells. Scientists have been studying Tat as a potential target for new HIV therapies, as inhibiting Tat could potentially stop the virus from replicating and spreading. However, developing effective Tat inhibitors has proven to be a difficult challenge due to the complex nature of the protein."}
{"question":"Hello, A few months ago, I keep smelling a moldy smell in the air (in my room) and its really bothering me, Ive began to sneeze a lot, my nose is always runny in one and stuffy in the other. After some time, Ive finally located on the back of a piece of furniture, there were tiny, hairy black spots growing all over the surface area. Ive cleaned everything with bleach and sanitize everything and I stopped smelling the moldy smell. However, for past two-weeks, I keep smelling a strong pungent urine smell everywhere, especially at night as I lay in bed before falling asleep. During the day the smell is more faint and doesnt last as long. But at night it seems like my bed was once soaked in a pool of urine but is now dry; when I smell every surface area of the bed, it smells like clean linen but the urine smell just floats in the air. Dreadful as it sounds, I actually get down on the carpet and sniff for the smell and I find nothing. I own a small dog for almost three years now, he is house-trained and only goes outside or in a designated area in the house (we trained him to use a litter box.) I checked the carpet area around his litter box and there are no urine smell either. When it smells so bad and someone is home with me, I ask if they smell it too but no one never smell anything. I have had migraine headaches for years and when the pungent smell lingers for too long it triggers my migraine. Every day for two-weeks now, I would wake up with a runny nose and sneezing for the first 30-45 mins. When I get out to go to school or at work, I sometime smell a faint urine smell as well, it reoccurs outside of home.

Episodes may come and go (be transient), last as long as 2 to 3 weeks (be short-term), or be long-lasting (chronic).\nCommon factors associated with insomnia include:\nPhysical illness Depression Anxiety or stress Poor sleeping environment such as excessive noise or light Caffeine Alcohol or other drugs Use of certain medications Heavy smoking Physical discomfort Daytime napping Counterproductive sleep habits: Early bedtimes Excessive time spent awake in bed\nDisorders include:\nPsycho-physiological insomnia: a condition in which stress caused by the insomnia makes it even harder to fall asleep Delayed sleep phase syndrome: your internal clock is constantly out of synch with the accepted day\/night phases; for example, patients feel best if they can sleep from 4 AM to noon Hypnotic-dependent sleep disorder: insomnia that occurs when you stop or become tolerant to certain types of sleep medications Stimulant-dependent sleep disorder: insomnia that occurs when you stop or become dependent on certain types of stimulants\nPROBLEMS WITH STAYING AWAKE:\nDisorders of excessive sleepiness are called hypersomnias.\nThese include:\nIdiopathic hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness that occurs without an identifiable cause) Narcolepsy Obstructive and central sleep apnea Periodic limb movement disorder Restless leg syndrome\nPROBLEMS STICKING TO A REGULAR SLEEP SCHEDULE:\nProblems may also occur when you do not maintain a consistent sleep and wake schedule. This occurs when traveling between times zones and with shift workers on rotating schedules, particularly nighttime workers.\nSleep disruption disorders include:\nIrregular sleep-wake syndrome Jet lag syndrome Natural short sleeper (the person sleeps fewer hours than normal but has no ill effects) Paradoxical insomnia (the person actually sleeps a different amount than they think they do) Shift work sleep disorder\nSLEEP-DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORS:\nAbnormal behaviors during sleep are called parasomnias and are fairly common in children.\nThey include:\nSleep terrors Sleep walking REM sleep-behavior disorder (a type of psychosis in which a person \"acts out\" dreams so violently that they may injure the person sleeping with them)"}
{"question":"How do the protein levels in plasma compare to the protein levels in interstitial fluid? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"The protein levels in plasma are higher than the protein levels in interstitial fluid. Plasma is the liquid component of blood, and it contains a variety of proteins, including albumin, globulins, and fibrinogen. These proteins play important roles in maintaining the osmotic pressure of the blood, transporting nutrients and hormones, and helping to defend against infections. In contrast, interstitial fluid is the fluid that surrounds cells in tissues, and it contains fewer proteins than plasma. The lower protein levels in interstitial fluid help to maintain the proper balance of fluids between the blood and the tissues."}
{"question":"Network structures have attracted much interest and have been rigorously studied in the past two decades. Researchers used many mathematical tools to represent these networks, and in recent days, hypergraphs play a vital role in this analysis. This paper presents an efficient technique to find the influential nodes using centrality measure of weighted directed hypergraph. Genetic Algorithm is exploited for tuning the weights of the node in the weighted directed hypergraph through which the characterization of the strength of the nodes, such as strong and weak ties by statistical measurements (mean, standard deviation, and quartiles) is identified effectively. Also, the proposed work is applied to various biological networks for identification of influential nodes and results shows the prominence the work over the existing measures. Furthermore, the technique has been applied to COVID-19 viral protein interactions. The proposed algorithm identified some critical human proteins that belong to the enzymes TMPRSS2, ACE2, and AT-II, which have a considerable role in hosting COVID-19 viral proteins and causes for various types of diseases.

We included 315 subjects (174 with OSA and 141 without OSA) who performed at least two CT scans (under similar settings). Both groups had a similar duration between the first and second CT scans of 3.6 years. BMD decreased in those with OSA and increased age. A multivariate linear regression indicated that OSA is associated with BMD alterations after controlling for age, gender, and cardiovascular diseases.

{"question":"This paper explores the pipeline of new and upcoming vaccines as it relates to monitoring their safety. Compared with most currently available vaccines, that are constituted of live attenuated organisms or inactive products, future vaccines will also be based on new technologies. Several products that include such technologies are either already licensed or at an advanced stage of clinical development. Those include viral vectors, genetically attenuated live organisms, nucleic acid vaccines, novel adjuvants, increased number of antigens present in a single vaccine, novel mode of vaccine administration and thermostabilisation. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) monitors novel vaccines, from the time they become available for large scale use. GACVS maintains their safety profile as evidence emerges from post-licensure surveillance and observational studies. Vaccines and vaccine formulations produced with novel technologies will have different safety profiles that will require adapting pharmacovigilance approaches. For example, GACVS now considers viral vector templates developed on the model proposed by Brighton Collaboration. The characteristics of those novel products will also have implications for the risk management plans (RMPs). Questions related to the duration of active monitoring for genetic material, presence of adventitious agents more easily detected with enhanced biological screening, or physiological mechanisms of novel adjuvants are all considerations that will belong to the preparation of RMPs. In addition to assessing those novel products and advising experts, GACVS will also consider how to more broadly communicate about risk assessment, so vaccine users can also benefit from the committee’s advice.

Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Kallmann syndrome occurs at a rate of 1 in 10,000 male births and 1 in 50,000 female births. It may be inherited as an X-linked condition, an autosomal dominant condition or as an autosomal recessive condition. Statistics are sparse, but it seems that autosomal dominant is the most common form of heredity.\nOne recent paper  quoted an incidence in males of 0.025%, or 1 in 4,000, with the female incidence being 3 to 5 times less.\nEven though mutations in the KAL-1 gene on the X chromosome can cause Kallmann syndrome, only 11-14% of patients with Kallmann syndrome have detectable KAL-1 mutations.\nAutosomal dominant mutations have been described with the FGFR-1 (8p12) gene, sometimes referred to as the KAL-2 gene. This is thought to cause about 10% of cases.\nAutosomal recessive mutations of the GnRH receptor gene (4q13.2) have also been reported.  This defect appears to produce a wider spectrum of physical symptoms than with the other gene defects, and the defect lies in the ability of the pituitary gland to recognise GnRH, rather than the ability of the hypothalamus to produce GnRH. It is debatable as to whether this is in fact Kallmann syndrome since the GnRH receptor development is not related to anosmia.\nThere may also be no obvious family history of inheritance (sporadic cases). However, it is possible for Kallmann syndrome genes to be passed on to children of a sporadic case."}

{"question":"Cellular life depends on a complex web of functional associations between biomolecules. Among these associations, protein–protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes\/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks.

{"question":"What is the tonicity of pancreatic secretions in relation to plasma, and does this change with flow rate? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Pancreatic secretions are an important component of the digestive process, and they are produced by the pancreas in response to food intake. These secretions contain a variety of enzymes and other substances that help break down food in the small intestine. One important characteristic of pancreatic secretions is their tonicity, or the concentration of solutes relative to plasma. It has been found that pancreatic secretions are iso-tonic relative to plasma, regardless of flow rate. This means that the concentration of solutes in pancreatic secretions is the same as that in plasma, which helps to ensure that the body can absorb nutrients from the small intestine without any disruption to fluid balance. The iso-tonicity of pancreatic secretions is maintained by a variety of mechanisms, including the regulation of ion transport across the epithelium of the pancreatic ducts."}

{"question":"What is the catalase status of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and why are patients with chronic granulomatous disease susceptible to infection by this bacterium? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is catalase positive, which means it produces the enzyme catalase, that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease have a genetic defect that affects their immune system's ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are important for killing bacteria. As a result, these patients are more susceptible to infections by catalase-positive bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can produce their own catalase to neutralize ROS and evade the immune system. Chronic granulomatous disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects about 1 in 200,000 people and can result in recurrent infections, inflammation, and tissue damage. Treatment for chronic granulomatous disease typically involves antibiotics and other therapies to manage symptoms and prevent complications."}

{"question":"BACKGROUND: To date, no recommendations have been published on when and how to start again carrying out elective, non-urgent surgery on COVID-19-negative patients after the epidemic peak has been reached in a given country or region and the pressure on healthcare facilities, healthcare workers and resources has been released by so far that elective surgery procedures can be safely and ethically programmed again. This study aims to investigate whether elective orthopaedic surgery will increase the risk of developing COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a combined retrospective and prospective studies performed at a national tertiary hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Subjects were patients who underwent elective orthopaedic surgeries at our institution from April to May 2020. Those who were previously infected with COVID-19 from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reverse transcriptase (RT) examination obtained via nasopharynx and oropharynx swab, as well as those who were reluctant to participate were excluded from the study. RESULTS: A total of 35 subjects (mean age 32.89 ± 17.42) were recruited. Fifteen (42.9%) subjects were male, and 20 subjects (57.1%) were female. Mean duration of surgery was 240 min with the longest and shortest duration of 690 and 40 min, respectively. General anaesthesia was performed in the majority of cases in 18 surgeries (51.4%) with local anaesthesia as the least in 2 surgeries (5.7%). Length of stay of our study was 6 days of average. None of the patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: We found that elective orthopaedic surgery may not be associated with increased cases of COVID-19 cases. However, our study was limited by short duration of follow-up. Further studies are required in order to investigate the affect of undergoing elective surgery and the number of COVID-19 cases.

{"question":"What type of hypersensitivity reactions does histamine mediate and through which receptors? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Histamine mediates type 1 hypersensitivity reactions through the activation of H1 receptors. Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions are also known as immediate hypersensitivity reactions and are mediated by IgE antibodies. When an individual is exposed to an allergen, IgE antibodies are produced, which bind to mast cells and basophils. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, cross-linking of the IgE antibodies on the mast cells and basophils leads to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. The histamine released by mast cells and basophils binds to H1 receptors on various target cells, including smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and sensory nerve endings, leading to the characteristic symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, and itching. The activation of H1 receptors by histamine is a critical step in the pathogenesis of type 1 hypersensitivity reactions and is a target for drugs used to treat allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis and urticaria."}

{"question":"INTRODUCTION: (Background) The role of pharmacists revolves around providing the highest levels of care to society and ensuring the provision of medicine to all patients. However, with the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19), pharmacists as a very important part of healthcare professionals’ team are responsible for fighting against the disease regardless of their setting of practice. The role of pharmacists will undergo a little change to extend and include other roles in order to ensure the safety of the community and limit the virus spread. Also, they will be required to obtain information from reliable sources, and to be up to date, so they can be reliable advisors to the community and raise their awareness. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to highlight community and hospital pharmacists’ roles during (COVID-19) global pandemic, and to clearly illustrate how they are contributing to maintain pharmacy services continuity, supporting other healthcare professionals, and facilitating the patient’s education. SUMMARY: Clinical pharmacists provide direct patient care through monitoring adverse drug reactions, ensuring individualized treatment, performing evidence-based practice, and evaluating drugs in clinical trials. On the other hand, community pharmacists which are the most accessible healthcare providers by the community increase their awareness regarding the preventive measures, balance medicines supply and demand, provide drive-thru and home delivery services, offer telehealth counselling, psychological support, refer suspected COVID-19 patients, and provide vaccination when available.

This problem is amplified when disruptions are added, either endogenously through Byzantine failures of agents within the swarm, or exogenously by some external source, such as a GNSS jammer. In this paper, we first introduce an improved localization method based on distance observation. Then, we devise schemes for detecting Byzantine agents, in scenarios of endogenous disruptions, and for detecting a disrupted area, in case the source of the problem is exogenous. Finally, we apply pool testing techniques to reduce the communication traffic and the computation time of our schemes. The optimal pool size should be chosen carefully, as very small or very large pools may impair the ability to identify the source\/s of disruption. A set of simulated experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which enable reliable error estimation even amid disruptions. This work is the first, to the best of our knowledge, that embeds identification of endogenous and exogenous disruptions into the localization process.

{"question":"What is dead space, and how is it related to ventilation and perfusion in the lungs? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Dead space refers to the ventilation of lung regions that are not perfused, meaning that there is no blood flow to these areas. This can occur when there is a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion, such as when air flows to areas of the lung that are not receiving blood. The ratio of ventilation to perfusion is known as the V\/Q ratio, and when this ratio is infinite (V\/Q = infinit), it means that there is no blood flow to the area being ventilated. Dead space can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs, as the air being breathed in does not come into contact with blood vessels where oxygen and carbon dioxide can be exchanged."}

{"question":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has created havoc all across the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India since its beginning on 30th January 2020. As of 1st January 2021, India has recorded 10,305,788 cases and 149,218 deaths from this deadly pandemic. It has been observed through the data;across states and UTs, the trend and pattern of this disease are not similar at all. There are many reasons for these dissimilarities which are categorized into indicators to assess the vulnerability in this study. We have examined vulnerabilities in 28 states and 8 UTs of India. Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) has been applied with certain modifications to calculate the Vulnerability Index ( VI). The figure resulting from the vulnerability assessment corresponds that the factors involved in the three-section exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity had a significant impact on deciding the vulnerability of the population. The result identified the states and UTs which are more vulnerable and need more attention from the government and policymakers. The proposed method of study is unique in its sense as vulnerability index calculation is purely based on a secondary source of data and therefore has an expectation of a higher degree of practical application. © 2021, Russian Geographical Society.

{"question":"Which species of Plasmodium is known for forming adhesive knobs on red blood cells that can block blood vessels? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Plasmodium falciparum is the species of the malaria parasite that is known for forming sticky knobs on the surface of infected red blood cells. These knobs are made up of proteins called PfEMP1, which allow the parasite to adhere to the walls of small blood vessels and avoid detection by the immune system. The adhesion of infected red blood cells to the vessel walls can lead to the occlusion of blood vessels and the development of severe complications, such as cerebral malaria, respiratory distress, and kidney failure. P. falciparum is responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths worldwide, and efforts to control and eliminate the disease are ongoing."}

{"question":"This study investigated the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress and determined the association between various factors, social support, and depression, anxiety, and stress among university healthcare workers in Malaysia after the government lifted the movement control order (MCO) put in place to curb the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This online, cross-sectional survey recruited 399 participants from two university hospitals, and they were administered a self-reported questionnaire on demographic, personal, and clinical characteristics, as well as COVID-19-related stressors and coping. In addition, they completed the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) to measure perceived social support, as well as the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess depression, anxiety, and stress. We found that the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 21.8%, 31.6%, and 29.1%, respectively. Participants with moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress made up 13.3%, 25.8%, and 8.1% of the sample, respectively. Being single or divorced, fear of frequent exposure to COVID-19 patients, agreeing that the area of living had a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, uncertainty regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the area of living, and a history of pre-existing psychiatric illnesses were associated with higher odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conversely, having more than three children and greater perceived friend support were associated with lower odds of depression, anxiety, and stress. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress remained elevated even after the MCO was lifted.

{"question":"Baculovirus expression vectors are successfully used for the commercial production of complex (glyco)proteins in eukaryotic cells. The genome engineering of single-copy baculovirus infectious clones (bacmids) in E. coli has been valuable in the study of baculovirus biology, but bacmids are not yet widely applied as expression vectors. An important limitation of first-generation bacmids for large-scale protein production is the rapid loss of gene of interest (GOI) expression. The instability is caused by the mini-F replicon in the bacmid backbone, which is non-essential for baculovirus replication in insect cells, and carries the adjacent GOI in between attTn7 transposition sites. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that relocation of the attTn7 transgene insertion site away from the mini-F replicon prevents deletion of the GOI, thereby resulting in higher and prolonged recombinant protein expression levels. We applied lambda red genome engineering combined with SacB counterselection to generate a series of bacmids with relocated attTn7 sites and tested their performance by comparing the relative expression levels of different GOIs. We conclude that GOI expression from the odv-e56 (pif-5) locus results in higher overall expression levels and is more stable over serial passages compared to the original bacmid. Finally, we evaluated this improved next-generation bacmid during a bioreactor scale-up of Sf9 insect cells in suspension to produce enveloped chikungunya virus-like particles as a model vaccine.

{"question":"Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2, a large number of genomes have been sequenced with unprecedented speed around the world. This marks a unique opportunity to analyze virus spreading and evolution in a worldwide context. However, currently, there is not a useful haplotype description to help to track important and globally scattered mutations. Also, differences in the number of sequenced genomes between countries and\/or months make it difficult to identify the emergence of haplotypes in regions where few genomes are sequenced but a large number of cases are reported. We proposed an approach based on the normalization by COVID-19 cases of relative frequencies of mutations using all the available data to identify major haplotypes. Thus, we can use a similar normalization approach to tracking the global temporal and geographic haplotypes distribution in the world. Using 48 776 genomes, we identify 5 major haplotypes based on 9 high-frequency mutations. Normalized global geographic and temporal analysis is presented here highlighting the current importance of nucleocapsid mutations (R203K, G204R) above the highly discussed D614G in spike protein. Also, we analyzed age, gender, and patient status distribution by haplotypes, but scarce and not well-organized information about this is publicly available. For that, we create a web-service to continuously update our normalized analysis of mutations and haplotypes, and to allow researchers to voluntarily share patient status information in a well-organized manner to improve analyses and making possible monitor the emergence of mutations and\/or haplotypes with patients preferences or different pathogenic features. Finally, we discuss currently structural and functional hypotheses in the most frequently identified mutations.

{"question":"What happens to chloride and water secretion in the lungs and GI tract in individuals with cystic fibrosis? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"In individuals with cystic fibrosis, there is a decrease in chloride and water secretion in the lungs and GI tract. This is due to a genetic mutation that affects the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. As a result, the mucus in the lungs becomes thick and sticky, making it difficult to breathe and leading to recurrent infections. In the GI tract, the decreased secretion of water and chloride can cause problems with digestion and absorption of nutrients. Treatment options for cystic fibrosis include medications to improve lung function, antibiotics to treat infections, and nutritional support to maintain adequate weight and growth. In some cases, lung transplantation may be necessary."}

{"question":"Assays using ELISA measurements on serially diluted serum samples have been heavily used to measure serum reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and are widely used in virology and elsewhere in biology. We test a method using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to reduce the workload of these assays and measure reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens to human serum samples collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflection titers for SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (S1S2), spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleoprotein (N) inferred from 3 spread-out dilutions correlated with those inferred from 8 consecutive dilutions with an R(2) value of 0.97 or higher. We confirm existing findings showing a small proportion of pre-pandemic human serum samples contain cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 and N, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases serum reactivity to the beta-HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 S1S2. In serial dilution assays, large savings in resources and\/or increases in throughput can be achieved by reducing the number of dilutions measured and using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to infer inflection or endpoint titers.

{"question":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE Due to the COVID-19 pandemic all schools in Poland were closed and obliged to conduct lessons remotely. The aim of the study is to present the demographic analysis of difficulties with remote learning, as perceived by students during coronavirus pandemic in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS In April 2020, a nationwide online survey was conducted among adolescents aged 11-18 (N=2408). Quantitative and qualitative data were used. Teenagers were asked about the problems connected with remote learning. In order to examine the overall level of remote learning difficulties, a scale of remote learning difficulties (RLD) was devised (range 0-23 points). Differences connected with gender, age and place of residence were analysed. RESULTS More than a half of the teenagers surveyed rated the increased demands from teachers as a major problem. This answer appeared statistically more often among girls than boys (59.6% v. 53.2%). Almost every third adolescent saw the lack of consultation (31.6%) as a significant problem. Difficulties related to learning in the remote system were most often described as considerable by the oldest students (17-18-years-old) and those living in rural areas. The big problem for them was usually much higher requirements of teachers and poor organization of distance learning. The mean level on the scale of remote learning burden was M=11.9 (SD=7.1). Technical difficulties and insufficient skills in using software constituted additional problems most frequently mentioned by students. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to pay particular attention to organizing appropriate technical conditions for remote learning, especially in rural areas, where students have complained more often than in cities about equipment and problems with access to the Internet during the pandemic.

{"question":"OBJECTIVES: Gastrointestinal manifestations of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have been well established, but pancreatic involvement is under debate. Our aims were to evaluate the presence of acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients and to assess the frequency of pancreatic hyperenzymemia. METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 110 consecutive patients (69 males, 41 females; mean age, 63.0 years; range, 24-93 years) met these criteria and were enrolled in the study. The clinical data and serum activity of pancreatic amylase and lipase were assayed in all patients using commercially available kits. RESULTS: None of the patients studied developed clinical signs or morphological alterations compatible with acute pancreatitis. However, it was found that 24.5% of the patients had amylase values above 53 IU\/L and 16.4% had lipase values above 300 IU\/L. Only 1 patient (0.9%) had both amylase and lipase values in excess of 3-fold the upper normal limit without clinical signs of pancreatitis.

{"question":"An approach to genetically engineered resistance to pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection was examined by using a transgene encoding a soluble form of nectin-1, also known as herpesvirus entry mediator C. Nectin-1 is an alpha-herpesvirus receptor that binds to virion glycoprotein D. Nectin-1 mediates entry of PRV, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and bovine herpesvirus type 1. To assess the antiviral potential of an ectopic expression of the nectin-1 ectodomain in vivo, six transgenic mouse lines expressing a soluble form of nectin-1, consisting of an extracellular domain of porcine nectin-1 and the Fc portion of human IgG1, were generated. All of the transgenic mouse lines showed nearly complete resistance to PRV infection by means of both i.p. and intranasal routes. These results suggest that the introduction into farm animals of a transgene encoding a soluble form of nectin-1 would offer a potent biological approach to generating alpha-herpesvirus-resistant livestock.

{"question":"COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and has become a global pandemic. There is no highly effective medicine or vaccine, most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response, especially the virus specific IgG and IgM responses. However, the IgG\/ IgM responses is barely known. To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG\/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the IgG\/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG\/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage). This study presents the first whole picture of the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG\/ IgM responses, and provides insights to develop precise immuno-diagnostics, effective treatment and vaccine.

{"question":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected not only the emergency medical system, but also patients' regular ambulatory care, as such decrease in the number of patients visiting outpatient clinics decreased in 2020 than in 2019, or the ban lifting of subsequent visits by telephone for outpatient clinics since March 2020 in lieu of ambulatory care for chronic diseases. In this context, we investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ambulatory care at Japanese outpatient clinics for patients with chronic neurological diseases during 2020. We collected data from the administrative claims database (DeSC database) covering more than 1 million individuals. Serial changes in the frequency of subsequent outpatient visits to clinics or hospitals (excluding large hospitals) for chronic ambulatory care of epilepsy, migraine, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 2020 were measured. As a result, since April 2020, the monthly outpatient visits for epilepsy, PD, and AD decreased slightly but significantly (approximately 0.90 in relative risk [RR]) but visits for migraine increased (RR = 1.15). Telephone visit was most frequently used in April-May, in less than 5% of monthly outpatient clinic visits for the examined neurological diseases. Outpatient visits for migraine treatment were more likely to be done by telephone than in case of other diseases (adjusted Odds ratio = 2.08). These results suggest that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on regular ambulatory care for several chronic neurological diseases yielded different effect depending on the disease, in terms of the frequency or type of outpatient visits.

Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Volvulus of the midgut, which is a twisting of the small intestine that can lead to bowel obstruction, is more commonly seen in infants and children. This is thought to be due to the fact that the midgut undergoes a physiological herniation during fetal development, which can predispose it to twisting and obstruction. Volvulus of the midgut is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent bowel ischemia or perforation. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and bloody stools."}

{"question":"Which enzyme is considered the rate-limiting enzyme of the process of fatty acid β-oxidation? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"The enzyme Carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid β-oxidation.\n\nFatty acid β-oxidation is a metabolic pathway that involves the breakdown of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used as an energy source by the body. This pathway is important for maintaining energy homeostasis in the body, particularly during periods of fasting or low-carbohydrate intake.\n\nThe first step in fatty acid β-oxidation is the transport of fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondria, where they can be broken down by the β-oxidation pathway. This transport is facilitated by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), which is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane.\n\nCPT-1 catalyzes the transfer of the fatty acid from coenzyme A to carnitine, which allows the fatty acid to cross the mitochondrial membrane and enter the mitochondrial matrix. This step is considered to be the rate-limiting step of fatty acid β-oxidation, as it controls the entry of fatty acids into the pathway.\n\nDeficiencies in CPT-1 can lead to a variety of health problems, including fatty acid oxidation disorders, which are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the breakdown of fatty acids for energy production."}

Early diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is essential for epidemic prevention and control. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is an important criterion for diagnosing COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing also has certain false positives causing confusion in clinical diagnosis. This article summarizes the causes of false-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in clinical practice. The results indicate that the most common endogenous interferences include rheumatoid factor, heterophile antibodies, human anti-animal antibodies, lysozyme, complement, and cross-antigens. The exogenous interference is mainly incomplete coagulation of the specimen, contamination of the specimen, and insufficient optimization of the diagnostic kit's reaction system.

{"question":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The safety and efficacy of the Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms have been investigated in several studies. Most of these studies focused on specific aneurysms or a certain WEB device. Our objective was to report the experience of 2 German centers with the WEB device, including technical feasibility, safety, and short-term angiographic outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study of all ruptured and unruptured aneurysms that were treated with a WEB device (WEB Double-Layer, Single-Layer, and Single-Layer Sphere) between April 2012 and August 2014. Primary outcome measures included the feasibility of the implantation and the angiographic outcome at 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included the clinical outcome at discharge and procedural complications. RESULTS Fifty-five aneurysms in 52 patients, including 14 ruptured aneurysms, underwent treatment with the WEB device. The median age of patients was 55 years (range, 30-75 years); 19\/55 (37%) were men. The device could be deployed in all patients and was implanted in 51\/55 (93%) cases. Procedural complications occurred in 6\/51 (12%), comprising 2 thromboembolic events, 2 thrombus formations, 1 high-grade posterior cerebral artery stenosis, and 1 aneurysm rupture. None of these had clinical sequelae. Angiographic follow-up at 3 months was available for 44\/51 (86%) aneurysms. A favorable angiographic result at 3 months was achieved in 29\/44 (66%) cases, whereas the percentage of good anatomic results increased from 40% in 2012 to 75% in 2014. CONCLUSIONS The WEB device proved to be safe. Acceptable occlusion rates can be achieved but seem to require wide experience with the device.

{"question":"The test-negative design is routinely used for the monitoring of seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness. More recently, it has become integral to the estimation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness, in particular for more severe disease outcomes. Because the design has many important advantages and is becoming a mainstay for monitoring postlicensure vaccine effectiveness, epidemiologists and biostatisticians may be interested in further understanding the effect measures being estimated in these studies and connections to causal effects. Logistic regression is typically applied to estimate the conditional risk ratio but relies on correct outcome model specification and may be biased in the presence of effect modification by a confounder. We give and justify an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) estimator for the marginal risk ratio, which is valid under effect modification. We use causal directed acyclic graphs, and counterfactual arguments under assumptions about no interference and partial interference to illustrate the connection between these statistical estimands and causal quantities. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate and confirm our derivations and to evaluate the performance of the estimators. We find that if the effectiveness of the vaccine varies across patient subgroups, the logistic regression can lead to misleading estimates, but the IPTW estimator can produce unbiased estimates. We also find that in the presence of partial interference both estimators can produce misleading estimates.

{"question":"BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii is a representative probiotic yeast that has been widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, S. boulardii has not been studied as a microbial cell factory for producing useful substances. Agarose, a major component of red macroalgae, can be depolymerized into neoagarooligosaccharides (NAOSs) by an endo-type ß-agarase. NAOSs, including neoagarotetraose (NeoDP4), are known to be health-benefiting substances owing to their prebiotic effect. Thus, NAOS production in the gut is required. In this study, the probiotic yeast S. boulardii was engineered to produce NAOSs by expressing an endo-type ß-agarase, BpGH16A, derived from a human gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. RESULTS: In total, four different signal peptides were compared in S. boulardii for protein (BpGH16A) secretion for the first time. The SED1 signal peptide derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected as optimal for extracellular production of NeoDP4 from agarose. Expression of BpGH16A was performed in two ways using the plasmid vector system and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. The production of NeoDP4 by engineered S. boulardii was verified and quantified. NeoDP4 was produced by S. boulardii engineered using the plasmid vector system and CRISPR-Cas9 at 1.86 and 0.80 g\/L in a 72-h fermentation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on NAOS production using the probiotic yeast S. boulardii. Our results suggest that S. boulardii can be considered a microbial cell factory to produce health-beneficial substances in the human gut.

{"question":"In specific conditions and crisis situations such as the pandemic of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), or the COVID-19 disease, e-learning systems be-came crucial for the smooth performing of teaching and other educational pro-cesses. In such scenarios, the availability of e-learning ecosystem elements is further highlighted. An indicator of the importance for securing the availability of such an ecosystem is evident from the DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack on AAI@EduHr as a key authentication service for number of e-learning users in Republic of Croatia. In doing so, numerous users (teach-ers\/students\/administrators) were prevented from implementing and participat-ing in the planned teaching process. Given that DDoS as an anomaly of network traffic has been identified as one of the key threats to the e-learning ecosystem in crisis scenarios, this research will focus on overview of methodology for de-veloping a model for proactive detection of DDoS traffic. The challenge in de-tection is to effectively differentiate the increased traffic intensity and service requests caused by legitimate user activity (flash crowd) from the illegitimate traffic caused by a DDoS attack. The DDoS traffic detection model developed by following analyzed methodology would serve as a basis for providing further guidelines and recommendations in the form of response to events that may negatively affect the availability of e-learning ecosystem elements such as DDoS attack.

{"question":"BACKGROUND: Following gender-affirming penile inversion vaginoplasty or vulvoplasty, patients may seek vulvar revision procedures for a variety of common aesthetic and functional concerns. These indications for revision and accompanying techniques are not well-described in the literature. METHODS: Patients who underwent vulvar revision surgery at the authors' institution were identified, and patient demographics, surgical indications, operative details, and complications were described. Common complaints requiring external genital revision were sorted into four categories: clitoral, labial, introital, and urethral. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with a history of vaginoplasty underwent vulvar revision between May of 2017 and December of 2019. The mean age at surgical correction was 38.9 years. Ten patients (28.6 percent) had undergone prior secondary procedures (range, 1 to 3). Mean follow-up after revision surgery was 10.7 ± 8.7 months (range, 0 to 30.6 months). The majority of patients underwent concurrent revisions in multiple \"categories\". Labial aesthetic concerns were most common (n = 27, 77.1 percent), followed by clitoral (n = 20, 57.1 percent), urologic (n = 17, 48.6 percent), and introital complaints (n = 12, 34.3 percent). Twelve patients (34.3 percent) had canal stenosis requiring concurrent robot-assisted canal revision with peritoneal flaps. Complications included labial abscess (n = 1) and deep vein thrombosis (n = 1). Three patients (8.6 percent) underwent subsequent external genital revisions. Management approaches and surgical techniques for each of these common revision categories are provided. CONCLUSION: As more individuals seek vaginoplasty and vulvoplasty, surgeons must be prepared to address a range of common aesthetic and functional complaints requiring vulvar revision.

{"question":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious public health concern, with an exponentially growing number of patients worldwide. Computed tomography (CT) has been suggested as a highly sensitive modality for the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in the early stages of COVID-19. The typical features of COVID-19 in chest CT include bilateral, peripheral, and multifocal ground-glass opacities with or without superimposed consolidations. Patients with underlying medical conditions are at higher risks of complications and mortality. The diagnosis of COVID-19 on the basis of the imaging features may be more challenging in patients with preexisting cardiothoracic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignancies with cardiothoracic involvement. The extensive pulmonary involvement in some of these pathologies may obscure the typical manifestation of COVID-19, whereas other preexisting pathologies may resemble the atypical or rare CT manifestations of this viral pneumonia.

{"question":"Do inhaled corticosteroids cause the typical adverse effects associated with corticosteroid therapy? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"No, inhaled corticosteroids do not typically cause the same adverse effects associated with oral or systemic corticosteroid therapy because they have minimal systemic absorption. Inhaled corticosteroids are used to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are delivered directly to the lungs through an inhaler or nebulizer. Because they are not absorbed into the bloodstream to the same extent as oral or systemic corticosteroids, they are less likely to cause side effects such as weight gain, osteoporosis, and increased risk of infection. However, in rare cases, high doses of inhaled corticosteroids can cause localized side effects such as oral thrush or hoarseness."}

{"question":"Who is at highest risk for Heart block ? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"The risk factors for congenital and acquired heart block are different.\nIf a pregnant patient has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block.\nAutoimmune diseases can cause the body to make proteins called antibodies that can cross the placenta. (The placenta is the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mother's womb.) These antibodies may damage the baby's heart and lead to congenital heart block.\nCongenital heart defects also may result in congenital heart block. These defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. Most of the time, doctors don't know what causes these defects.\nHeredity may play a role in certain heart defects. For example, a parent who has a congenital heart defect may be more likely than other people to have a child with the condition.\nAcquired heart block can occur in people of any age. However, most types of the disorder are more common in older people. This is because many of the risk factors are more common in older people.\nPeople who have a history of heart disease or heart attacks are more likely to have heart block. Examples of heart disease that can lead to heart block include heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle diseases).\nOther diseases also may raise the risk of heart block. These include sarcoidosis and the degenerative muscle disorders Lev's disease and Lenegre's disease.\nExposure to toxic substances or taking certain medicines, such as digitalis, also can raise your risk of heart block.\nWell-trained athletes and young people are at higher risk for first-degree heart block caused by an overly active vagus nerve. You have one vagus nerve on each side of your body. These nerves run from your brain stem all the way to your abdomen. Activity in the vagus nerve slows the heart rate."}

{"question":"What are juxtacapillary (J) receptors and where are they located in the respiratory system? How do they respond to pulmonary capillary engorgement, such as that seen in left heart failure? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Juxtacapillary (J) receptors are specialized nerve endings located in the alveolar walls of the lungs. These receptors are sensitive to changes in the pressure and volume of the pulmonary capillaries, which are the tiny blood vessels that surround the alveoli. When these capillaries become engorged, such as in left heart failure, the J receptors are stimulated and send signals to the brainstem to increase ventilation. This results in rapid, shallow breathing, which is a compensatory mechanism that helps to reduce the amount of fluid in the lungs and improve oxygenation. The J receptors are just one of several types of receptors involved in respiratory regulation, and they play an important role in maintaining normal lung function in response to changes in blood flow and pressure."}
{"question":"Following 5 years of hip pain and 3 exploratory\/cleaning operations I finally had hip resurfacing 2 years ago. All was well and I was pain free until I had knee realignment surgery.

The hospital have x-rayed the joint and done an ultrasound and there is no fracture, no metal in the blood tests, no sign of inflammation \/ bursitis, no infection.

The pins placed in my knee are slightly visible and I have no sensation in the side of my lower leg, I asked if this could be the problem but have been told it s not an issue but I am hoping to get them removed soon just in case.

{"question":"What are the causes of Inflammatory bowel disease? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Causes of ulcerative colitis:\nThe cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. It may affect any age group, although there are peaks at ages 15 - 30 and then again at ages 50 - 70.\nThe disease usually begins in the rectal area and may eventually extend through the entire large intestine. Repeated swelling (inflammation) leads to thickening of the wall of the intestine and rectum with scar tissue. Death of colon tissue or sepsis may occur with severe disease.\nThe symptoms vary in severity and may start slowly or suddenly. Many factors can lead to attacks, including respiratory infections or physical stress.\nCauses of Crohn's disease: While the exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, the condition is linked to a problem with the body's immune system response.\nNormally, the immune system helps protect the body, but with Crohn's disease the immune system can't tell the difference between good substances and foreign invaders. The result is an overactive immune response that leads to chronic inflammation. This is called an autoimmune disorder.\nThere are five different types of Crohn's disease:\nIleocolitis is the most common form. It affects the lowest part of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine (colon). Ileitis affects the ileum. Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the stomach and first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. Jejunoileitis causes spotty patches of inflammation in the top half of the small intestine (jejunum). Crohn's (granulomatous) colitis only affects the large intestine.\nA person's genes and environmental factors seem to play a role in the development of Crohn's disease. The body may be overreacting to normal bacteria in the intestines.\nThe inflammation related to Crohn's disease frequently occurs at the end of the small intestine that joins the large intestine, but it may occur in any area of the digestive tract. There can be healthy patches of tissue between diseased areas. The ongoing inflammation causes the intestinal wall to become thick."}

{"question":"We aimed to examine the circulating microRNA (miRNA) profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and evaluate its potential as a source of biomarkers for the management of the disease. This was an observational and multicenter study that included 84 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 recruited during the first pandemic wave in Spain (March-June 2020). Patients were stratified according to disease severity: hospitalized patients admitted to the clinical wards without requiring critical care and patients admitted to the ICU. An additional study was completed including ICU nonsurvivors and survivors. Plasma miRNA profiling was performed using RT-qPCR. Predictive models were constructed using LASSO regression. Ten circulating miRNAs were dysregulated in ICU patients compared to ward patients. LASSO analysis identified a signature of three miRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-451a and miR-486-5p) that distinguishes between ICU and ward patients [AUC (95% CI) = 0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. Among critically ill patients, six miRNAs were downregulated between nonsurvivors and survivors. A signature based on two miRNAs (miR-192-5p and miR-323a-3p) differentiated ICU nonsurvivors from survivors [AUC (95% CI) = 0.80 (0.64-0.96)]. The discriminatory potential of the signature was higher than that observed for laboratory parameters such as leukocyte counts, CRP or D-dimer [maximum AUC (95% CI) for these variables = 0.73 (0.55-0.92)]. miRNA levels were correlated with the duration of ICU stay. Specific circulating miRNA profiles are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Plasma miRNA signatures emerge as a novel tool to assist in the early prediction of vital status deterioration among ICU patients.

{"question":"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arboviral zoonotic disease affecting many African countries with the potential to spread to other geographical areas. RVF affects sheep, goats, cattle and camels, causing a high rate of abortions and death of newborn lambs. Also, humans can be infected, developing a usually self-limiting disease that can turn into a more severe illness in a low percentage of cases. Although different veterinary vaccines are available in endemic areas in Africa, to date no human vaccine has been licensed. In previous works, we described the selection and characterization of a favipiravir-mutagenized RVFV variant, termed 40Fp8, with potential as a RVF vaccine candidate due to the strong attenuation shown in immunocompromised animal models. Compared to the parental South African 56\/74 viral strain, 40Fp8 displayed 7 amino acid substitutions in the L-protein, three of them located in the central region corresponding to the catalytic core of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In this work, by means of a reverse genetics system, we have analyzed the effect on virulence of these amino acid changes, alone or combined, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the simultaneous introduction of two changes (G924S and A1303T) in the heterologous ZH548-RVFV Egyptian strain conferred attenuated phenotypes to the rescued viruses as shown in infected mice without affecting virus immunogenicity. Our results suggest that both changes induce resistance to favipiravir likely associated to some fitness cost that could be the basis for the observed attenuation in vivo. Conversely, the third change, I1050V, appears to be a compensatory mutation increasing viral fitness. Altogether, these results provide relevant information for the safety improvement of novel live attenuated RVFV vaccines.

{"question":"How is the statistical power of a study calculated? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"The statistical power of a study is calculated using a formula that involves several factors, including the sample size, the level of significance (α), and the effect size. Specifically, the statistical power (1 - β) is calculated as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, or in other words, the probability of detecting a true effect if one exists. A higher statistical power indicates a greater likelihood of detecting a significant effect if it is present in the population being studied."}
{"question":"Among NRTIs, which medication is known to cause hyperpigmentation specifically on the palms and soles of the feet? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Emtricitabine is the NRTI that is known to cause hyperpigmentation on the palms and soles of the feet. NRTIs, or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are a type of medication used to treat HIV and hepatitis B. Emtricitabine is one of several NRTIs that can cause skin discoloration as a side effect, but it is unique in that it tends to cause hyperpigmentation specifically on the palms and soles of the feet. This side effect is usually harmless and does not require treatment, but it is important to talk to a healthcare provider if you experience any unusual skin changes while taking emtricitabine or any other medication."}

{"question":"We conducted in the Dahomey Gap (DG) a pioneer study on the genetic tracing of the African pangolin trade. We sequenced and genotyped 189 white-bellied pangolins from 18 forests and 12 wildlife markets using one mitochondrial fragment and 20 microsatellites loci. Tree-based assignment procedure showed the ‘endemicity’ of the pangolin trade, as strictly fed by the lineage endemic to the DG (DGL). DGL populations were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity, an overall absence of equilibrium, inbreeding depression and lack of geographic structure. We identified a 92-98% decline in DGL effective population size 200-500 ya –concomitant with major political transformations along the ‘Slave Coast’– leading to contemporaneous estimates inferior to minimum viable population size. Genetic tracing suggested that wildlife markets from the DG sourced through the entire DGL range. Our loci provided the necessary power to distinguish among all the genotyped pangolins, tracing the dispatch of same individuals on the markets and within local communities. We developed an approach combining rarefaction analysis of private allele frequencies and cross-validation with observed data that could trace five traded pangolins to their forest origin, c. 200-300 km away from the markets. Although the genetic toolkit that we designed from traditional markers can prove helpful to trace the pangolin trade, our tracing ability was limited by the lack of population structure within DGL. Given the deleterious combination of genetic, demographic and trade-related factors affecting DGL populations, the conservation status of white-bellied pangolins in the DG should be urgently re-evaluated.

{"question":"The flipped classroom method requires that students engage with homework before coming to the classroom so that class time can be spent on active and collaborative learning exercises. Research has demonstrated that this can improve student performance versus traditional lecturer-led teaching methods. Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the vast majority of teaching has been entirely online such that even ‘in-class’ time has been virtual. The current article examined whether online-only delivery affects the efficacy of the flipped classroom approach. Method: Grades for a research methods and statistics module and a statistics portfolio assignment were compared across consecutive cohorts of undergraduate psychology students taught by different methods. Results: Overall grades on the module did not differ significantly across teaching methods but student performance on statistics tests did. Flipped classrooms, whether accompanied by on-campus or synchronous online classes, led to significantly better performance than traditional methods. No detriment was observed by teaching entirely online. Conclusion: The key advantages of the flipped classroom method appear driven by active learning which can occur irrespective of classroom context. Teaching Implications: Using flipped classrooms can be a useful tool, particularly in subjects where students may otherwise be less engaged with the content.

{"question":"Is it possible to diagnose intestinal atresia using an abdominal X-ray? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Yes, an abdominal X-ray can be used to diagnose intestinal atresia. Intestinal atresia is a congenital condition in which a portion of the intestine is missing or blocked. An abdominal X-ray can show signs of intestinal obstruction, such as the presence of gas and fluid in the intestine, which can suggest the presence of intestinal atresia. However, in some cases, additional imaging studies, such as an ultrasound or CT scan, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the obstruction. Additionally, other tests, such as blood tests and stool tests, may be performed to evaluate for signs of infection or inflammation. The specific diagnostic approach will depend on the individual case and the suspected cause of the intestinal obstruction."}
{"question":"BACKGROUND Traditionally, open hepatic resection is the first choice of treatment for symptomatic enlarging hepatic hemangiomas, which requires a large abdominal incision and is associated with substantial recovery time and morbidity. Minimally invasive laparoscopic resection has been used recently in liver surgery for treating selected hepatic hemangiomas. However, laparoscopic liver surgery poses the significant technical challenges and high rate of conversion. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been proved feasible in the treatment of hepatic hemangiomas with a size range of 5.0-9.9 cm. It is controversial to treat giant hepatic hemangiomas (≥10.0 cm) by means of RF ablation, due to the low technique success rate and high incidence of ablation-related complications. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of combined laparoscopic resection with intratumoral RF-induced coagulation for giant hepatic hemangiomas. METHODS We treated 2 patients with giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma (12.0 cm and 13.1 cm in diameters respectively) by laparoscopic resection following intratumoral coagulation of the tumor with RF ablation. RESULTS Blood loss during resection was 100 ml (case 1) and 300ml (case 2) respectively. No blood transfusion and dialysis were needed during perioperative period. The two patients were discharged 6 days (case 1) and 12 days (case 2) after surgery without any complications, respectively. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT follow up showed there was no residual tumor. CONCLUSIONS It is feasible to treat giant subcapsular hepatic hemangioma by laparoscopic tumor resection boosted by intratumoral coagulation using RF ablation, which may open a new avenue for treating giant hemangioma.

{"question":"This paper analyses the herding behaviour among exchanges around the expiration of bitcoin futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The database extends from December 2017 to October 2020, taking as a reference the main exchanges that trade bitcoin (Binance, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit, Kraken, and Gemini) and using hourly closing prices and trading volumes in bitcoin and US dollars. Adapting the proposal of Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000) (CCK) to test conditional herding, we obtain results that indicate that the herding effect is significant during the week before expiration. After expiration, the herding effect lasts for a few hours and disappears. Information overload originating, among other causes, from sophisticated investors’ strategies may generate this mimetic behaviour. The results show the relevance of intraday data applied to specific events such as expiration since the unconditional analysis shows, in general, anti-herding behaviour throughout the period of study.

{"question":"Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) represent one of the most common hospital-acquired infections, carrying a significant morbidity and risk of mortality. Increasing antibiotic resistance among the common bacterial pathogens associated with HAP and VAP, especially Enterobacterales and nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria, has made the choice of empiric treatment of these infections increasingly challenging. Moreover, failure of initial empiric therapy to cover the causative agents associated with HAP and VAP has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. This review provides an overview of antibiotics newly approved or in development for the treatment of HAP and VAP. The approved antibiotics include ceftobiprole, ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, and cefiderocol.

{"question":"This article focuses on Red Latinoamericana de Archivos, Museos, Acervos y Investigadores LGBTQIA+ (AMAI LGBTQIA+), a network composed of researchers and institutions related to LGBTQIA+ memory in Latin America, founded in 2019. First, the authors analyse the network's creation arising from the discontent of some participants of the June 2019 Archives, Libraries, Museums and Special Collections (ALMS) Conference, in Berlin, who felt bothered by the lack of attention given to subaltern perspectives on LGBTQIA+ history and memory. Next, the authors describe and analyse the network's first year of activities communicated through its Facebook group. Multiple challenges arose from creating a network with members from different national origins, languages, and identities, especially considering the conservative political contexts of several Latin American countries and the social distancing measures imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, the authors present a general profile of the network's members and a map of partner institutions. Finally, the article points out some challenges to the network's continuity and its desire to render Latin America more visible in the broader panorama of global LGBTQIA+ history. The authors conclude by highlighting the importance of AMAI LGBTQIA+ in stimulating further discussions about the participation of global-south researchers and perspectives on global queer history initiatives. © 2021.

{"question":"Resection of metastases in the lung from a wide range of primary sites has become a routine part of the daily clinical practice of a thoracic surgeon. The European Society of Thoracic Surgeons brought together an international group of surgeons in 2006. The initial intention for this Lung Metastasectomy Working Group was to evaluate the evidence and to generate guidance. It rapidly became clear that although there was great experience in performing this surgery, the belief in its benefit relied on clinical case series and registry reports. Evidence fell well short of Evidence Based Medicine standards and robust guidance could not be produced on this basis. This supplement of the Journal of Thoracic Oncology brings together the findings and conclusions of the group under three headings. The first section covers generic issues such as imaging and the technical aspects of pulmonary metastasectomy. The second deals with specific cancer types in which pulmonary metastasectomy is more frequently performed. The third addresses the way forward to get better evidence for this practice.

Answer this question truthfully","answer":"hello. the bleeding due to menses on 21st january after ipill confirmatively rules out pregnancy which could have occurred due to sex on 13th january. the repeat sexual intercourse held on 25th january (she was in her safe period and hence pregnancy is unlikely) and then 10th february (this time she was in her fertile period) might result in pregnancy. but you have had protected sexual intercourse. chances of pregnancy are minimal and the spotting is unlikely to be an implantation bleed. the spotting is more likely to be a breakthrough bleeding which is possibly due to the side effects of ipill which is known to cause irregularity in menses for the next 2 cycles. however, the best way to confirm or negate pregnancy would be to opt for a serum beta hcg test. this test if positive shall confirm pregnancy and if the levels are less than 1, then pregnancy is ruled out completely. this shall allay your anxiety. revert back to an obstetrician and gynaecologist online for further follow up  take care."}

{"question":"BACKGROUND: Several reports on the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variations in Indonesia COVID-19 cases led to genomic dysregulation with the first pandemic cases in Wuhan, China. MicroRNA (miRNA) plays an important role in this genetic regulation and contributes to the enhancement of viral RNA binding through the host mRNA. OBJECTIVE: This research is aimed to detect miRNA targets of SARS-CoV-2 and examines their role in Indonesia cases against Wuhan cases. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from GISAID ( https:\/\/www.gisaid.org\/ ), NCBI ( https:\/\/ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ), and National Genomics Data Center ( https:\/\/bigd.big.ac.cn\/gwh\/ ) databases. MiRDB ( https:\/\/github.com\/gbnegrini\/mirdb-custom-target-search ) was used to annotate and predict target human mature miRNAs. For statistical analysis, we utilized a series chi-square test to obtain significant miRNA. DIANA-miRPath v3.0 ( http:\/\/www.microrna.gr\/miRPathv3 ) analyzed the Gene Ontology of mature miRNAs. RESULT: The statistical results detected five significant miRNAs. Two miRNAs: hsa-miR-4778-5p and hsa-miR-4531 were consistently found in the majority of Wuhan samples, while they were only found in less than half of the Indonesia samples. The other three miRNA, hsa-miR-6844, hsa-miR-627-5p, and hsa-miR-3674, were discovered in most samples in both groups but with a significant difference ratio. Among these five significant miRNA targets, hsa-miR-6844 is the only miRNA that has an association with the ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The Gene Ontology analysis of five significant miRNA targets indicates a significant role in inflammation and the immune system. The specific detection of host miRNAs in this study shows that there are differences in the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 between Indonesia and Wuhan.

{"question":"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept all over the world, several studies have shown the susceptibility of a patient with cancer to COVID-19. In this case, the removed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-adjacent (GBM-A), GBM-peritumor and GBM-central (GBM-C) tissues from a convalescent patient of COVID-19, who also suffered from glioblastoma meanwhile, together with GBM-A and GBM tissues from a patient without COVID-19 history as negative controls, were used for RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing and immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and the virus antigen (N protein). The results of RNA ISH, electron microscopy observing showed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects some cells within human GBM tissues and SARS-CoV-2 in GBM-C tissue still exists even when it is cleared elsewhere. Immunohistochemical staining of ACE2 and N protein showed that the expressions of ACE2 are significantly higher in specimens, including GBM-C tissue from COVID-19 patient than other types of tissue. The unique phenomenon suggests that the surgical protection level should be upgraded even if the patient is in a convalescent period and the pharyngeal swab tests show negative results. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to confirm whether the shelter-like phenomenon happens in other malignancies due to the similar microenvironment and high expression of ACE2 in some malignancies.

{"question":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about how patients with low socioeconomic status (SES) experience their chronic disease, and how it impacts health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Compared to their more affluent counterparts, worse outcomes have been reported. A better understanding of the domains of HRQoL that are relevant to these specific populations is therefore needed. We explored the experiences of living with a chronic disease in low SES persons. METHODS: A qualitative interview study was performed in Flanders, Belgium. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in chronically ill patients, selected through purposive sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis followed an inductive and iterative approach. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were interviewed. Six major themes were identified: a heavy bag to carry, loss of autonomous life, inner and outer loneliness, emotional imbalance, unmet need for support, and coping strategies. Patients experienced their illness as an additional problem on top of all other problems (i.e. financial\/social problems, traumatic life events). In general, the disease burden and non-disease burden were mutually reinforcing, resulting in greater dependency, greater risk of social isolation, greater psychological distress, and greater risk of impaired HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide detailed insight into the experiences of living with a chronic disease in low SES persons. A conceptual model is proposed that can be used in daily clinical practice to raise awareness among clinicians and health care providers that the patient’s needs go beyond the disease itself. Future research is needed to validate and test the model. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186\/s12875-021-01578-7.

{"question":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease. The combination therapy of methotrexate (MTX) and Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) is commonly used. Patients with RA are at increased risk of malignancy, however, it remains unclear whether the combination therapy is associated with a higher risk. OBJECTIVE: To assess the malignancy risk among patients with RA receiving combination therapy of JAKi and MTX compared to MTX alone. METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane and Embase were thoroughly searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with RA receiving JAKi and MTX, from inception to July 2020. Primary endpoints were malignancy events, Non melanomatous skin cancer (NMSC) and malignancy excluding NMSC and secondary endpoints were serious adverse events (SAE), deaths. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI were calculated using the Mantel–Haenszel random-effect method. RESULTS: 659 publications were screened and 13 RCTs with a total of 6911 patients were included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in malignancy [RR = 1.42; 95% CI (0.59, 3.41)], neither NMSC [RR = 1.44 (0.36, 5.76)] nor malignancies excluding NMSC [RR = 1.12 (0.40, 3.13)]. No statistically significant difference between the two groups for SAE [RR = 1.15 (0.90, 1.47)] and deaths [RR = 1.99 (0.75, 5.27)] was found. CONCLUSION: The adjunction of JAKi to MTX is not associated with an increased risk of malignancy when compared to MTX alone. There is no increased risk of SAE and deaths when compared to MTX alone in patients with RA.

{"question":"Could a female who had unprotected intercourse during the early follicular phase and received a negative pregnancy test still be at risk of unintended pregnancy? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"Yes, a female who had unprotected intercourse during the early follicular phase and received a negative pregnancy test could still be at risk of unintended pregnancy. The early follicular phase is the time immediately following menstruation when the ovaries are preparing to release an egg. Although the likelihood of conception is lower during this time, it is still possible for sperm to survive in the female reproductive tract for several days and fertilize an egg once it is released. Additionally, pregnancy tests may not always be accurate, especially if taken too early. Therefore, it is important for individuals who are sexually active and do not wish to become pregnant to use effective contraception consistently and correctly."}

{"question":"In a middle-aged female presenting with dry mouth, dysphagia, oral thrush, dental caries, and dry eyes, what is the likely diagnosis? Answer this question truthfully","answer":"The likely diagnosis in a middle-aged female presenting with these symptoms is Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to dry mouth and dry eyes, respectively. Other symptoms may include dysphagia, oral thrush, and dental caries due to the lack of saliva to protect the teeth and gums. Diagnosis may involve blood tests to look for specific antibodies and imaging studies to evaluate the salivary glands. Treatment may involve medications to manage symptoms, such as artificial tears and saliva, as well as immunosuppressive therapy to manage the underlying autoimmune disorder."}
{"question":"Background: The 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, Hubei in December 2019. Beside from Hubei Province, no large-scale epidemiological data are available. The purpose of the study is to investigate the epidemiology of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Shandong province, China. Methods Data were obtained from the Epidemic Daily Report Network. Confirmed patients and suspected cases in Shandong were included in the analysis. Data including age, sex, address, time of disease onset, time of diagnosis, and sources of transmission were collected. Results By February 13 th , 2020, 518 patients in Shandong province were formally confirmed with COVID-19 with an additional 78 suspected. Most of the confirmed patients were young or middle-aged (mean: 42.6 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.26:1. Among the 596 patients, 29.2% had a history of traveling in Hubei within 14 days. There were 99 cluster outbreaks and 5.23 cases were transmitted by one cluster outbreak. Among the confirmed patients, 17 patients (3.3%) had critical pneumonia, 36 (6.9%) had severe pneumonia and no deaths reported. Conclusions Considering the collective confirmed and suspected cases of SARS-Cov-2 in Shandong by February 13 th , 2020, males and the young and middle-aged populations were more frequently affected by the virus, which was most commonly transmitted through cluster outbreaks. Since the initial case of SARS-Cov-2 was identified, the onset-diagnosis delay was reduced with time.
