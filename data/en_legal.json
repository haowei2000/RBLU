{"question":"I gave my friend 180 litecoin to invest ($10,000 right now) because he had a “hedge fund”. He claimed to have a series 7 and that he could triple my money. Now I want my money back and he said he sent it to the wrong address, and he won’t show me any proof that it sent. I don’t know who to go to or what to do. Do I go to the police or FBI? Is it worth it to sue? Was a crime even committed?\n","answer":" Yea sue Answer #2: Scam is always a crime. Do you have any kind of evidence? A proof that you gave him this money? A written evidence that he would make you earn money with your investment?"}
{"question":"Boyfriend received a \"general discharge\" after 4 years from the army for what they deemed as a \"pre-existing condition\" (crohns disease). He had never been diagnosed or evaluated for crohns disease before the army. He now receives no benefits because of his discharge and they are requiring he pay back half of his student loans ($40,000), which he only has because they requested he get a degree to become an officer. Is there any way he can fight any of this? Mainly the student loans.\n","answer":" Former Naval officer here. \n\nThe general discharge seems right. If he did not know he had crohns, he does not meet the criteria for fraudulent enlistment. Nor is he qualified for an honorable due to medical conditions as the disease is not due to military service. Honestly, you are lucky they are willing to pay half the student loans instead of sticking them all on you. Nothing can be done if something was improper, other than appeal it through the VA. I'm guessing the reason the loans came into effect because he was the Army equivalent of STA21, and didn't finish the contract. "}
{"question":"They gave me schizophrenia medication and seizure medication and salt water IV which is all strictly against my diet and lifestyle. I gave no consent. I was having a bad acid trip but i wasn’t aggressive but they forced medicine on me that negatively impacted me greatly\n","answer":" I love that you think a salt water IV is against your diet, but LSD is not. \n\nThe answer to your question is no.Answer #2: You want to sue medical professionals for taking steps to keep you alive when you incapacitated yourself with drugs?Answer #3: When you are unconscious, your consent is implied.  In case it's your next question... Yes, you are also responsible for the medical treatment bill.Answer #4: Medical Malpractice, which is what you are claiming, is very fact specific and you need to speak with a MedMal lawyer.\n\nThat being said, based on your post and your incapacitation, it does not sound like the clinic did anything objectively or reasonably wrong."}
{"question":"I met a girl on a dating app, app said shes 18 but she mentioned she's 17, I'm 22. Every google search says age of consent is 16, she turns 18 soon, I just can't help but feel like I'm going to get arrested. Am I 100% in my legal rights to meet up with her, and see what happens? I don't want my life ruined, but she's hot, and who the fuck made it that she can't be a day under 18 for it to be moral?\n","answer":" The law's not necessarily about what's moral. It's about what you will or won't be penalized for doing. Since there has to be a line somewhere (there's plenty of evidence that sexual relationships with kids are sufficiently bad for their development to be worth banning), the line's going to be a bit arbitrary.\n\nMany states do have a \"close in age\" exception to age of consent laws, to make the line _less_ arbitrary and to deal with the reality that teenagers will have sex with each other and probably shouldn't go to jail for it. New Jersey has such an exception, provided you're within four years of your partner: it doesn't apply to you, since you're more than four years older.\n\nThe age of consent in New Jersey is 16. If she's not lying to you the way she lied to the site, she can legally consent to sexual contact with you. However, your paramour is a minor: if her parents tell you to stay away from her, stay away from her.Answer #2: Life advice...don't do it.  There is probably a world of maturity difference between you two.  You are in completely different places in your life.  "}
{"question":"Asking for my friend for what is likely to happen. His girlfriend's kid who is like 9 or 10 drank some of the alcohol he made accidentally and she ended up in the hospital. Him and his girlfriend were drunk or asleep when it happened. They both live there with him. The cops found his still and some other jars of his homemade alcohol on the property. In South Carolina under the law what is likely to happen to my friend?\n","answer":" Lets be honest, it takes quite some alcohol to end up in the hospital, and kids that age are not prone to drinking that amount of nasty burning. Not saying it isnt possible, just saying the level of belief is low and cps will be suspicious. Get a lawyer ASAP."}
