{"question":"Hey all, this is about my friend 20F. She is a University student in the state of Utah. Up to this point her parents have helped her out by lending her a car, paying for the phone, all insurances, and generally helping out when she needed it. Her parents live about an hour from her. She has a full ride scholarship to school, so tuition is not an issue. Her plan is to graduate with her Bachelors in one year, and then continue on to her Masters, also in Utah. She also works 3 jobs; two on campus and another is an internship off campus.\n\nWell, her parents decided to totally cut her off; take the car, take her off all insurances, cancel her phone line, no communication, the whole enchilada. I won't share the details behind it, but it is pretty petty. They have cut off a sibling for a similar petty issue as well, so they have a history. They have also threatened physical violence via email and text if she tries to contact them or go to their (her) house. She has copies of both email and text with her parent's names attached to them.\n\nThis situation also takes away FAFSA from her since she will not have access to her parent's tax forms and other information. So, she cannot apply for federal aid as she is not technically an \"independent\" until she is 26 or in graduate school (I think being an emancipated minor is also called being independent for FAFSA purposes). The state also has no resources for her, that we or the University Financial Aid Office know of.\n\nIs there anything she can do, within the confines of the law, that could help? Any way to get declared as \"independent\" and receive Pell and other grants and subsidized\/other loans? Anything at all?\n\nThanks so much everyone!\n","answer":" No. Her parents have no obligation to support her and their refusal to do so doesn't make her an independent. She should look at probate loans. "}
{"question":"I gave my friend 180 litecoin to invest ($10,000 right now) because he had a “hedge fund”. He claimed to have a series 7 and that he could triple my money. Now I want my money back and he said he sent it to the wrong address, and he won’t show me any proof that it sent. I don’t know who to go to or what to do. Do I go to the police or FBI? Is it worth it to sue? Was a crime even committed?\n","answer":" Yea sue Answer #2: Scam is always a crime. Do you have any kind of evidence? A proof that you gave him this money? A written evidence that he would make you earn money with your investment?"}
{"question":"Boyfriend received a \"general discharge\" after 4 years from the army for what they deemed as a \"pre-existing condition\" (crohns disease). He had never been diagnosed or evaluated for crohns disease before the army. He now receives no benefits because of his discharge and they are requiring he pay back half of his student loans ($40,000), which he only has because they requested he get a degree to become an officer. Is there any way he can fight any of this? Mainly the student loans.\n","answer":" Former Naval officer here. \n\nThe general discharge seems right. If he did not know he had crohns, he does not meet the criteria for fraudulent enlistment. Nor is he qualified for an honorable due to medical conditions as the disease is not due to military service. Honestly, you are lucky they are willing to pay half the student loans instead of sticking them all on you. Nothing can be done if something was improper, other than appeal it through the VA. I'm guessing the reason the loans came into effect because he was the Army equivalent of STA21, and didn't finish the contract. "}
{"question":"I literally just got off a plane and went to pick up some drunk friends with my rental car. I parked on the side in a red zone with my blinkers on and got out the car to get my friends to help them in bc they were drunk. I was gone for about 5 minutes and when we came back from a block away, there's a cop waiting for me. I explain the situation and he still writes me up a traffic ticket for blocking the road, which I wasn't even doing. \n\nThe penalty is a whopping $160... which is completely stupid. I don't have time to fight it since I leave in a few days. What would happen if I just leave this alone? I live in PA \n","answer":" Having your blinkers on does not allow you to park where you aren't allowed. "}
{"question":"They gave me schizophrenia medication and seizure medication and salt water IV which is all strictly against my diet and lifestyle. I gave no consent. I was having a bad acid trip but i wasn’t aggressive but they forced medicine on me that negatively impacted me greatly\n","answer":" I love that you think a salt water IV is against your diet, but LSD is not. \n\nThe answer to your question is no.Answer #2: You want to sue medical professionals for taking steps to keep you alive when you incapacitated yourself with drugs?Answer #3: When you are unconscious, your consent is implied.  In case it's your next question... Yes, you are also responsible for the medical treatment bill.Answer #4: Medical Malpractice, which is what you are claiming, is very fact specific and you need to speak with a MedMal lawyer.\n\nThat being said, based on your post and your incapacitation, it does not sound like the clinic did anything objectively or reasonably wrong."}
{"question":"I met a girl on a dating app, app said shes 18 but she mentioned she's 17, I'm 22. Every google search says age of consent is 16, she turns 18 soon, I just can't help but feel like I'm going to get arrested. Am I 100% in my legal rights to meet up with her, and see what happens? I don't want my life ruined, but she's hot, and who the fuck made it that she can't be a day under 18 for it to be moral?\n","answer":" The law's not necessarily about what's moral. It's about what you will or won't be penalized for doing. Since there has to be a line somewhere (there's plenty of evidence that sexual relationships with kids are sufficiently bad for their development to be worth banning), the line's going to be a bit arbitrary.\n\nMany states do have a \"close in age\" exception to age of consent laws, to make the line _less_ arbitrary and to deal with the reality that teenagers will have sex with each other and probably shouldn't go to jail for it. New Jersey has such an exception, provided you're within four years of your partner: it doesn't apply to you, since you're more than four years older.\n\nThe age of consent in New Jersey is 16. If she's not lying to you the way she lied to the site, she can legally consent to sexual contact with you. However, your paramour is a minor: if her parents tell you to stay away from her, stay away from her.Answer #2: Life advice...don't do it.  There is probably a world of maturity difference between you two.  You are in completely different places in your life.  "}
{"question":"I was talking to a friend about the the Brock Turner case and how the judge recently got...I don't know what to call it...recalled? Well, my position was that even even though the judge made some very questionable comments to say the least, his hands were kinda tied. Because he was sentenced to 6 months which, as I understand it, by definition means it's a misdemeanor right? So the prosecutor pursued this as a misdemeanor and not a felony. Could the judge have said no that's too light? Or we're his hands tied?\n","answer":" The prosecutor decides which charges to bring agsinst the accused and the judge decides on if the accused is guilty and on the sentence.\n\nIf someone is charged and tried for murder, the judge cannot change the charge to manslaughter for example."}
{"question":"PA - Long legal battle. Every attempt at me ultimately just takes away from my kids and our time together. Not sure what to do besides remove myself from the equation then they can’t be used as pawns anymore. Or hear me crying. Ncp isn’t actually what’s best for them but maybe if I’m not there that will change. Assuming ncp will just file for emergency custody after a few days if I remain missing and after six months they’ll move to terminate my parental rights. Are there any other legal consequences of doing it this way? Child abandonment charges or warrants for not following the order?\n","answer":" You should speak with a therapist and a lawyer who can help you find the remedies here that don’t involve giving up time with your children. \n\nBut to answer your question more directly, the non-custodial parent could seek substantive changes in the orders, especially around child support payments. But probably could not terminate parental rights. "}
{"question":"This isn't about anything *specific*, I'm just curious how this works. Can you agree to a search, but a partial search? Like say the cops want to search your house (without a warrant) can you say yes to every room except *this* room? Or something similar? Or same with your car. You can look everywhere but don't tear up my seats? Don't look in the glove?\n\nI'll likely never have to deal with this because I would never allow a search without a warrant, I'm just curious how that works. It seems like since it's voluntary you should be able to have stipulations. \n","answer":" You can do this and you can revoke your consent at anytime. There is a danger to this, which is why it is always better to decline a voluntary search. If a cop is searching your car voluntarily and he is about to open the glove box at which point you start screaming \"I revoke my consent!\" you might have just given him probable cause by your reaction."}
{"question":"Milwaukee, Wi. I’ve been parking in a parking garage for 2 years downtown. I’ve been reversing into parking spaces the entire 2 years. Recently I had an “official” note placed on my windshield stating that I’m not allowed to back into the spaces. The contract on the back of the parking voucher in part reads “only a license is granted hereby and no bailment is created”. I’m not sure what that means or if it’s relevant but nothing else in the contract applies to this situation. Multiple vehicles reverse into parking spaces in the garage everyday and I’ve never seen another note left on a vehicle. I’m assuming the garage can do whatever they want. \n","answer":" Are the spaces straight or diagonal?   If the lanes are one way and you are backing into a diagonal space, you would end up pulling out against traffic.\n\nDid you have to register for access to the garage or is it one where you receive a ticket upon entrance?   It could be that they want to see your license plate and backing in requires them to get out of their vehicle and actually walk around to see it.\n\nAt the end of the day though, yeah, the garage can probably make and enforce any rules they want within reason.Answer #2: I wish my garage would institute a no back-in. I’m sure you’re perfectly good at maneuverability, but I constantly get held up in the morning by people backing in. Also, when I’m backing out to leave and you’re pulling forward to leave, I don’t have a clear visual cue that you’re moving. It drives me nuts. \n"}
{"question":"Asking for my friend for what is likely to happen. His girlfriend's kid who is like 9 or 10 drank some of the alcohol he made accidentally and she ended up in the hospital. Him and his girlfriend were drunk or asleep when it happened. They both live there with him. The cops found his still and some other jars of his homemade alcohol on the property. In South Carolina under the law what is likely to happen to my friend?\n","answer":" Lets be honest, it takes quite some alcohol to end up in the hospital, and kids that age are not prone to drinking that amount of nasty burning. Not saying it isnt possible, just saying the level of belief is low and cps will be suspicious. Get a lawyer ASAP."}
{"question":"So my friend is the dad, they have two kids, 7 and 4, and have been living together for about that long. I have looked into what constitutes common law marriage in Texas, and they meet the requirements other than getting it recognized by a court. And i read that they still have time to get it recognized (so they can get an official divorce) and what not.\n\nI'm worried that if for some reason they aren't able to get their common law marriage recognized, or that if the cheating 'wife' doesn't cooperate with him, would the dad be able to get much from the break up. \n\nI apologize if this is all over the place, but basically, the mom has been a terrible mom over the past year. Lately she's been gone at night, caught in lies, yelling at her kids that she's not coming back, and other things that would make a divorce case go in the dad's favor. \n\nBut what if he can't get to that point because she doesn't cooperate or even because of financial reasons between the two?\n","answer":" If he wants custody, he can file for custody. No divorce needed unless assets need to be divied up."}
{"question":"The guy hit my parents vehicle and ran off. The police found him and he admitted to doing it, his boss came and said the insurance company would basically pay whatever we wanted. The guy who hit my parents didn’t have a license either. I just don’t know where to go from here. My daughter isn’t hurt, but I want to sue for emotional damage as she doesn’t even want to go near her grandparents now. I also want to sue whoever gave him a car to drive, knowing he didn’t have a license. Do I have a case here?\n","answer":" &gt;My daughter isn’t hurt, but I want to sue for emotional damage as she doesn’t even want to go near her grandparents now.\n\nYou might as well not even entertain that road of thought. You aren't going to get very far basing a personal injury suit on emotional damages.Answer #2: Their insurance will pay for damages.\n\nThat includes damages to your vehicle and medical bills. Suing for emotional trauma isn't really a thing unless you legit go seek therapy due to said accident, then those bills may be covered.Answer #3: You aren’t going to get money just because, there needs to be something diagnosably wrong and actual money spent as a consequence.\n\nGo get your daughter examined by the pediatrician if she hasn’t been already. If they find something wrong, follow up with specialists. If therapy is necessary (it probably isn’t, but it’s possible), go do that. Replace the car seat. Those are the things you can get compensated for.Answer #4: NAL- same thing happened when my 3 y\/o kids were in the car with my mom and got rear ended. One kid went to urgent care right away. No major injuries other than some soft tissue bruising. Other kid did not go to doc at all. The one with the injury got $1500, the one without got $500 and they reimbursed the car seats immediately. So, she will likely get something but not much. Negotiate with their initial offer.  Also, make sure you immediately replace the car seat. They will reimburse you for that no questions asked. She should never sit in the seat again that was in the car during the crash."}
{"question":"The location is Florida. \n","answer":" I live in NJ. My alimony and child support is higher than what I make. I have been in the NJ superior court for five years trying to get a reduction. I am in court right now in trial trying to get a reduction. The courts do not care that I have had no take home paycheck for over three years. In fact, without my family I would be homeless. I wish you the best of luck but here in NJ the courts do not follow the law or exercise common sense. \n"}
{"question":"So last night the genius above me drilled into the sprinker line and all hell broke lose. His apt got 3-4 inches and water soaked into the walls of my apartment and was dripping out of all sorts of places. A Company came by, ripped out some floorboards, poked some holes and now there are 4 giant fans and a dehumidifier in my living room. I stayed at a hotel last as it's 90+F in my apt and sounds like an airplane hangar.

{"question":"2 years ago I was in the Texas A&amp;M rotc and band (you have to be in rotc to be in the marching band) and on the way from a football game the senior sousaphone (marching tuba) leader made us run back to our dorms in the dark in formation while carrying our sousas (frankly stupid thing to do, the band director even said the same thing after my injury) and because I couldn't see I put my foot into a stormdrain and fell cracking the cartilage behind my kneecap. After the injury I tried to tell the people put in charge of me that I couldn't run and needed to go to the doctor. The rotc physical therapist and the school doctor both misdiagnosed me and due to the misdiagnosis and the other rotc students put into a position of authority by the school (they told me I had to keep running\/marching\/working out or I would be kicked out of the program) I continued to try to walk\/run\/workout on my knee till I could no longer stand. At that point I left the rotc both to remove myself from the frankly horrible living conditions and because the upperclassmen harassment and bullying. At that point I went to an actually qualified physician who did a MRI and found the cartilage injury. However at that point there was no real recourse for fixing it. I had to take pain meds (opiates that caused me to not be able to focus on my biomedical engineering schooling, and caused me to have to drop out of the school) Due to this self assigned \"failure\" I fell into a depression that lasted for close to 2 years. All in all this injury cost me thousands in medical bills, thousands in therapy, and now I cannot work any physical labor job and will walk with a limp for the rest of my life, I also have to spend $2000+ a year on injections so I can walk without a cane or crutch. My question is there legal recourse for this loss of money, loss of ability to work, physical and emotional pain, and continued medical costs? \n","answer":" Talk to a personal injury lawyer but that sounds like a very, very difficult claim for a number of reasons. Two years have passed and you may be perilously close to or past the statute of limitations. The initial  at fault party is another student and you might not be able to hang liability on anybody else.  Finally, the injury was not diagnosed for quite some time following the incident, and you may have difficulty proving causation.  Not saying it’s impossible, but my initial reaction as a personal injury lawyer would be to decline representation on this claim. "}
{"question":" I went to my first shift at KFC this morning, and after awhile of watching training videos, the head manager told the assistant manager to get a uniform set for me from the office.  I followed her into the office, and she used a precarious office chair with wheels as a step ladder, reached to the very top shelf near the ceiling, and started to pull the box down. The box slipped and it fell directly onto my face.  It was probably around an 8 lbs box falling from near the ceiling. I was wearing my prescription glasses (wire frames), and the nose-pad piece of metal shoved to hard into my nose that it completely bent it. If I had not caught it it would most likely have broken my nose. My face feels very swollen and likely to bruise, especially my nose and brow bone area. When I got home I started to get some pretty intense pains going through my shoulder, and the pain in my head has been expanding to the back of my head.  My nose and brow bone areas are painful when I touch them, I think I may have a mild concussion, as I am having trouble focusing, balance issues, and some anxiety.   It is worth noting that in the moment she asked me if I was okay, to which I said yes (I think the shock kept me from feeling too much at that moment). I did not know  what to do (especially because it was my first day) so I did not say anything at work, but called their insurance company's hotline as soon as I got home.   What is the best course of action to try and receive some form of compensation? I will be visiting urgent care tomorrow and not attending work for the foreseeable future. If I want to leave this job because of this incident, should I wait until I have received workers comp to begin the process of working somewhere else? Advice would be much appreciated as I am living on my own and don't have someone to turn to for advice.\nTopic:\nPersonal Injury\n","answer":" You would be covered under workers comp. See your manager to get started on filing a claim."}
{"question":"So as the title says my mom's apartment complex threw away a lot of irreplaceable stuff while working on the complex storage units. They had asked her to empty the storage unit and put all of the stuff in the empty apartment next door until the renovation was complete but apparently someone didn't get the memo.\n\nWe found out about a week after the fact that one of the maintenance workers had gone in there and mistakenly thrown everything out. This included hundreds of dollars worth of tools and most importantly my late father's ashes and all of the photos my family has accumulated over the years.\n\nWe've talked with a lawyer that is my mom's friends father in law but he wasn't really interested in taking this particular case. He sent them  a demand letter for 90k compensation for the loss and the complex sent a counter offer for around 2k which is just insulting. After that the lawyer that was helping us said he did not want to get further involved with the case.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what to do next but I have no idea who to talk to or where to look for a lawyer that will actually help with this or if we can even do anything at all.

{"question":"Back in July my security cameras caught a guy snooping around my house while I was at work. My backyard camera found him later walking up to the rear of my house, looking in, and then running off presumably because he saw my wife and daughters were home. \n\nThen two weeks ago in October at 2 in the morning, who I believe is the same guy gets into my car and pokes around. Runs away when the light comes on. Didn't get anything. Even though you can't see his face perfectly, his body language and height are the same. It's not obvious but I fully believe it's the same guy. \n\nFast forward to today, and the same guy enters my backyard. I was home and while calling the cops I noticed a number of of my neighbors outside also on the phone. Apparently he had been in other people's yards and they tracked him back to my house.

{"question":"My parents divorced 7 years ago in South Dakota. The judge determined a jointly held credit card account was to continue being paid by my father. The account was closed,  so no new debt was able to be put on the account, but I believe the balance at that time was around $10k. Apparently, a few years prior, credit card companies stopped removing debtors (my mother in this case) due to civil divorce rulings, so my mom has continued to show as a card holder. There have been a few times when my father didn't\/ couldn't afford to pay the bill, causing my mother to pay so it didn't hurt her credit. My father never reimbursed her. \n\nMy father has just filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and included my mother and the credit card bank as creditors. This would remove my father from the account, and make my mother wholly liable for the debt. \n\nIf my mother were to attend the bankruptcy hearing,  could this be a legitimate cause for it to be denied? Could just this account be excluded from the bankruptcy?

{"question":"So my mom found nudes on my phone of my girlfriend. She turned us in. That’s already about to be handled, I’m meeting with a probation officer to discuss if this goes to court or not. But my mom hates her and her family and is mad that her parents let us date knowing my parents didn’t. We’re both girls I’m 17 and she’s 15. My mom thought she was too young to date. And my dad is just homophonic. But after this whole case with the nudes is through, my parents want a restraining order on her and her family so they can’t contact me or see me etc. Can they actually do this if my girlfriend never harmed me, mentally or physically? My mom just hates her family and doesn’t want us having contact ever again.\n","answer":" Until you're 18 your parents can restrict you from contacting her even without a court order.Answer #2: It is very likely that a court will order you not to see each other given that you have exchanged the images. Your parents can just ask the court to make it part of any order and even if the judge was not planning on it. This is simply the reality of the situation in which you find yourself. Once you are 18, you will probably be able to see each other again, unless the court order goes on longer. Given you are both underage, you just don’t have much say.

{"question":"I had jury duty for the first time a week ago and while it was very exciting and educational, the actual trial was a joke as both sides were very week. It was basically a he said she said case with no evidence at all. The defendant stands to lose a lot and I am one of the few jurers who could clearly see how weak the case was. I was shocked how many of my fellow jurers were ready to find the guy guilty based on almost nothing except their own perception of character.\n\nThe jury was deadlocked and the judge called a mistrial. I guess there will be another trial down the road but I will not be involved at all.\n\nAnyway, what I wanted to ask here is if it is typically a no no for me to try to reach out to the defense attorney and give him my thoughts about what he did poorly during the trial. Basically I want to communicate some things that everybody in the jury said about it that should have been done.. Some very basic things that we were surprised did not happen.. I don't want to say anything specific, but I honestly think the attorney would be willing to listen to a quick bit of insight.\n\nI don't mean to sound like a dillusional person who is trying to get involved when it's not their place..

I just don’t  want to lose my daughter. \n\nHas anyone gone through this, or is currently dealing with this type of situation? \n\n\n","answer":" Being active duty, you should first talk to base legal services, and they may be able to refer you to someone with experience here.\n\nI would hope the courts recognized that you were Active Duty and going to be moving, and took that into account as far as visitation when you are in town, but you should definitely read the order to see if it specifically calls that out.  Here['s the DoD's site on the matter](https:\/\/www.militaryonesource.mil\/-\/child-custody-considerations-for-members-of-the-military), and it includes links to find legal assistance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;Answer #2: \\&gt;  fathers usually don’t get full custody\n\nWhen fathers fight for custody, they usually get it.  Most don't for a variety of reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would be good to have a lawyer to make this go faster, but this will be nowhere as involved as the original divorce\/custody decision.  Good luck."}
{"question":"A mom and dad got divorced.  He is paying her $1500\/month for 'unallocated support'.  No alimony or child support.  One kid is entering college, the other in high school.  Dad says the kid should take loans to go to school, mom says parents should split the bill and kid shouldn't take only a very small loan.   Neither parent has spare money as both have huge debts and expenses.  And neither makes a huge salary.  Does dad have a legal obligation to pay for college?

{"question":"Howdy\n\nI live in a town where the landlords bully the tenants into a corner until their complaint is dropped. I am relatively confrontational, so I have no problem calling the management team on their shit. \nOver the past year or so we (roommates and I) have contacted the managers to get our drier fixed. They always respond promptly, come out, and look at it. However, they say \"nothing is wrong with it, it must be user error\" or \"there might be a broken part\". They replace the part but nothing is ever fixed. We have continued contacting them and explaining the problem but alas nothing. It is obvious the washer and drier need to be replaced but they won't do it. this has happened before, our ac unit went out and we contacted them, the maintenance man came out and explained the problem to me. The coil had corroded and the unit needed to be replaced. I contacted the landlords and they said nope. I contacted the ac company and they had records showing the unit needed to be replaced a few years prior. They finally replaced it and all is well. \nSo jump to Monday, we were having problems with the ac unit and we are still contacting them about the drier. Maintenance came out and decided that the problem was from dirty ac filters.  Roommates agreed that it was roommate b's fault. At that time I expected to get a call that we would have to pay the maintenance call due to our fault and to pay it with this months rent. However, we were not contacted about the drier. \nWe get an email Friday saying we owed $200 by Monday. I contacted them back stating we would not pay unless we had our drier fixed. They called and stated we were not allowed to do that. However, our lease does not state we cannot withhold payment until a repair is complete. \n\nCan I withhold the payment? Or should I suck it up and pay, then start the battle for the drier another day? \n","answer":" Do NOT withhold payment. Texas is VERY landlord-friendly so you have to follow a very specific protocol. See [here](http:\/\/texastenant.org\/repairs.html) for a pretty thorough explanation, but bottom line is this all has to start with a written (on paper) request for repairs sent certified mail. They don't have to do jack if you just call them, so long as it isn't a habitability issue. Read that link top to bottom.Answer #2: In most states, if you're even allowed to withhold rent in certain circumstances, it's generally only for reasons effecting the habitability of your rental unit. I would recommend you not withhold any rent. "}
{"question":"Hello r\/legaladvice I'm a recent college grad working an unpaid internship at a recording studio where they make us clean  and sweep and paint constantly. I think it's illegal. We are supposed to have one learning day a week and one cleaning day a week, but often the learning days are ignored. \n\nIs it legal for them to make us clean all day? I twisted my ankle painting ceilings for this place. It feels wrong. Any advice would help.\n\nLocation: Massachusetts \n","answer":" Massachusetts has stricter standards for unpaid internships than the federal ones. Under federal law, unpaid internships can be offered by for profit companies as long as they meet 6 standards that ensure the benefits of the internship go to the intern and not the company. However, in Mass. only a charity, or educational or religious institute can offer an unpaid internship. So right off the bat if this recording studio is not one of those you need to be paid min wage.Answer #2: That wouldn't be legal even if you got one learning day and one cleaning day.

{"question":"My wife and I found a piece of artwork we liked in Chicago back during the summer.  It was in a gallery\/artist collective in Wicker Park, and so I contacted the gallery owner (I guess?) via his gallery's Facebook page about the piece.  He stated the piece was $1200, and gave us a name and address to make a check out to.  I confirmed the name was the one listed as the artist on one news site I found that spoke about the artwork.  My wife and I were in the process of moving to Nevada, so we emailed the recipient of the check and asked him if he could hold on to the piece for a month (it was hanging in a gallery, and had been for a few years, so we figured another month wasn't a problem).  He agreed.  Once we moved, he became more and more difficult to contact (long delays would go by between emails), one time speaking about how his mother was sick.  We weren't in a big hurry to get it, so we didn't press him that hard.  However, we now haven't heard from him in 2 months, despite calling, emailing, and Facebook messaging him.\n\nMy question now is: what is the next step?  I googled him and found out he had a record of property damage from 2015, and the name on the arrest record corresponds to the address he gave us, so I don't think it was a fake address.  So: we know where he lives, but we now live in NV. \n\nIs this something that we should call the cops about?  Small claims?  Learn our lesson and eat the $1200?\n\nEdit #1: I contacted the artist collective via email and they are going to look into the situation.  Posting a nasty review on the collective's Google Maps page probably didn't hurt.  \n","answer":" &gt; Is this something that we should call the cops about?\n\nNope. This is a civil matter, not a criminal one.\n\n&gt; Small claims?\n\nThat is how you would need to do it. But you have to file in a Chicago small claims court.

{"question":"I live in a luxury high-rise with some really nice amenities that are shared by all residents (e.g. Starbucks machines, a penthouse lounge, etc.)\n\nThere are 4 residents living here who are distributors for an MLM company who have been using these amenities for their business. They park several exotic cars with their company's logo outside the main entrance and frequently bring groups of 30-50 people over for sales pitches in our nice amenity rooms.\n\nThe lease specifically has a section on Prohibited Conduct that expressly disallows conducting any types of business activities here, with exception to work-at-home business that does NOT involve customers or business associates coming to the apartment. This does NOT fall within that exception.\n\nA group of 30 residents has gotten together and protested to building management, but the response we get is either \"we are monitoring the situation to make sure it isn't excessive\/disruptive\" or even \"it's not conducting business, they are just bringing people over for luncheons.\"\n\nOur problem with this is that it creates significant traffic and parking shortages, these guests tend to leave trash around the property, and - most importantly - we frequently find our access to these amenities curtailed when we want to use them. We are okay sharing with the needs of other residents, but when a business frequently brings huge groups in, it affects everyone else's ability to access them.\n\nWe know of at least one staff member who was even recruited by the MLM to become a distributor, so it appears there may be some conflicts of interest in how the rules were being enforced. He left a few weeks ago but we feel like that set a precedent here and that it's possible there are others \"on the take\".\n\nMight we have any remedies available to us if their failure to adhere to the lease is reducing our enjoyment of and access to the facilities?\n\nThank you!\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" Best non-legal course of action: keep using the shared amenities you're entitled to in the most disruptive way possible for their business.

{"question":"A little backstory: I live in a busy city with a large transient population and my apartment building is right in the heart of it. Unfortunately, tenants in the building were not locking the basement door, which accesses the laundry room, alley way, and bike storage area and a tenant in our building had his unlocked bike stolen from the basement. \n\nAs a result, the landlord changed all the locks and the tenants have been better about locking all building doors. However when the locks were changed the landlord forgot to give the USPS deliver a new key. So when another tenants package was marked \"delivered\" but was actually being held at the nearest post office, the tenant reported another theft to our landlord - despite the fact that it was never actually stolen (it was delivered after the post office got a new key to the building). \n\nSo now our landlord has decided to install security cameras inside the building with the intention being to monitor the tenants for package theft. Since it seems pretty obvious that the first incident was caused by an outside individual gaining access to our building, this seems a bit misdirected to me. Furthermore, it just generally weirds me out that my landlord will be able to see my comings-and-goings - a bit too Big Brother for my liking. \n\nI signed a lease in a building that didn't have 24\/7 monitoring. Do I have any right to object to their installation? \n\nEdit: typos. \n\n","answer":" In the building's common rooms, it is very likely perfectly legal. "}
{"question":"So my stepsons birth mother hasn't showed for her court hearings for not paying child support. This is the 3rd time she hasn't showed. She now has a warrant for her arrest again.

My step son (who is 8) is already having emotional issues because she didn't even show for her weekend last time and was also left alone by his cousin for half an hour and now has abandonment issues at home with husband and I. \n","answer":" You cannot just ignore the custody order regardless of child support. If she has a warrant and you know where she will be at drop off you could tip off the police, they may or may not care to arrest her. Answer #2: You can't ignore the custody order. Of course, you can tip the police off. The may even do something about it. Your strategy will depend on how you handoff the child to her, and the exact wording of your order.\n\nYou can petition the court for a change in custody. Not paying child support doesn't directly impact custody, but being incarcerated for failing to pay it might. Get a lawyer.\n\nBesides the legal advice, your husband needs to get his son into therapy. Abandonment can leave lifelong impact on a child's mental health.Answer #3: follow custody order and do what your lawyer says is best advice, but if it really is having an impact on the child its reasonable to not put him through that. but you need support because your husband will be in contempt. parental alienation is a real thing but if school psychologist or gal can back it up (ie grades slipping\/etc) you could maybe get supervised visitation where visitation is structured and observed and reports made to court "}

My idea for an excellent way to give back (and to get my practice's name out there in a positive light) to have my whole (future) team of hygienists, assistants, and office managers (and myself of course) colunteer at our local disaster relief logistics company one night a week (with team shirts for PR!)\n\nSo my question is, can I offer employees a signing bonus with the stipulation being they have to volunteer with us if they accept it?  (One night a week, 2-3 hours)  Or is that basically forcing them to volunteer, which I'm guessing would be pretty illegal?  \n\n\n","answer":" One night a week? Are you insane? One night a month is pushing it. Nobody wants to give up 1\/7th of their evenings for work stuff. *Maybe* one Saturday or Sunday afternoon a quarter.

However you will be a licensed dentist with a dental facility, so an evening per week there would be a waste. \n\nDental care is tremendously underserved in the US. \n\nFind an organization local to your practice that helps those in need. Offer to provide dental care to their clients. Restrict the offer to some number of hours or maybe 2-3 patients per week. \n\nThis would be much more valuable than anything else your office could do.

He has gone MIA no payments in months, has multiple tickets, and has the police looking for him. I am told that if he gets in an accident or kills someone I am liable, I am also told that since it is insured in his name I cannot report it stolen. Do I have any recourse?\n","answer":" If he gets into an accident you defintely can be held liable *unless* you report it as stolen. Since you own it you can report it stolen. Who's insuring it is irrelevant there. Actually if he's insuring it by himself he's committing insurance fraud (you cant legally insure something you don't own) which is a felony."}

{"question":"I moved late into on campus accommodation. I've lived their for 2 years in the past, and they used to take a payment automatically from my account\/notify me if I didn't have enough to pay.

I've been living here since March and haven't paid a penny over my deposit but haven't been reminded to pay through any form of communication. I'm moving out in June, when my tenancy expires will I still be legally accountable? Thanks!\n","answer":" IANAL and know nothing about UK law.\n\nYou should be prepared that they might figure this out at any time and demand immediate payment. In the US you would still owe this money and I'd be very surprised if that was not also true in the UK. You would be wise to set aside the rent each month in an account you do not touch. In the US they would be able to pursue payment of your debt for several years after the fact."}

You'll want to contact a criminal defense attorney in Georgia to examine your options.Answer #2: &gt; I just didn't want to clean up litter in parks in the shithole county where I grew up.\n\nEver think part of the reason its a shithole is because people commit crimes and then don't repay that debt back to the county? You may be the cause of the vicious cycle. If you are rehabilitated you know what you should do. Get lawyer. Turn yourself in. Make it right. Or flee to Alaska. Answer #3: &gt;  I just didn't want to clean up litter in parks in the shithole county where I grew up.\n\nIs community service as part of probation supposed to be something you WANT to do or just punishment that is less undesirable than being in prison?Answer #4: That's why you need an attorney.

Fast forward a month and I get a call informing me that the current resident has decided to stay and the apartment was no longer available. They offered me alternative apartments with a cash incentive. I declined, stating I wanted to proceed with the current contract I signed. The complex said this was not an option.  I would like the apartment I signed the lease for, the other apartments they offered are not as desirable. My current lease runs out at the end of the year and it would be difficult to find a comparable apartment to the one I wanted in that time frame. They have offered to refund my deposit and application fee. What are my options?\n","answer":" You can sue them for breach if you can show damages but do you have any?  It sounds like they are acting reasonably and they likey signed the lease in good faith. You can either accept the alternative unit or get all your money back. Answer #2: OP- It's likely your rental contract with the landlord has a clause for just this situation (where the existing tenant reverses the notice they gave) that dissolves the lease (takes the liability off your landlord).\n\nYou should take back the deposit back and\/or ask for a bigger concession on the other unit(s) they're offering you."}

{"question":"[deleted]\n","answer":" Montana basically says after a probation period, if not defined then six months, the employee can only be discharge for good cause.\n\n“Good cause” is defined as reasonable job-related grounds for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of operations, or other legitimate business reasons. \n\nThe above does not apply to collective bargaining agreements or valid employment contracts for a specific term. \n\nAs you can see the last \"other legitimate business reasons,\" leaves a huge area open for interpretation, to the point many will argue it basically leaves Montana as an \"at will\" state. Answer #2: I feel like everyone is ignoring OP's question. It doesn't seem that they are looking for wrongful termination, but the fact that the former employer is lying about the termination and tarnishing OP's name. I don't see any real comments from OP clarifying either. \n\nThe way I see it is OP worked for a practice, and had hygenists working for him. His employer is telling the hygenists that he just quit, that looks bad to them cuz their boss is leaving a job that allows him to pay him. This causes them to bail on OP the dentist. "}
{"question":"Me and my friends were going to a bonfire Friday night. We are all under 18 years old. When we got there, it was clear this was not a very minor friendly bonfire, so we decided to try and leave. As we were leaving a drunk person got on my car, and would not get off the car unless we drove him to the bonfire (which was 15 feet away from us). I told him no, we are leaving, and told him to get off. He grabbed my hat, and told me \"take me to the fucking bonfire\". I was really scared at this point. His friends came over and pulled him off my car, but the told my friend who was driving (it was my car, but my friend was driving) to \"stay where the fuck you are\". They left, then came back with my hat, gave it to me, and proceeded to beat the shit out of me. I have multiple cuts and a bruise on my right eye, a sore torso, and a very sore jaw, two days after this happened. We tried to get out of there, but the guys then punched the driver of our car and made him swerve and hit someones car. We were scared for our life, since there was a group of drunk rednecks trying to harm us, so we drove away. Now the owner of the car we hit texts me, and says I have two days to pay him back, or he is taking this to the police. I'm 17, with no money. What do I do?\n\nSome details: This was at night.

I have no criminal history other than a few speeding tickets, and my credit report is pretty good!  \n\nThe only thing I could possibly see them flagging is that my dad currently lives in Iran and I call him every weekend, although this seems like a ridiculous thing to fail me over.

{"question":"Some background info, my wife has Grave's Disease. It is a hyperthyroid condition that shows up around 18. Her specialist did radioactive iodine treatments and killed about 90% of it. This caused her to have to take sinthroid to replace the missing thyroid hormone. (I'm no doctor, this is just what I was told.) She is now 38 and has been on sinthroid for years. Her current doctor has been managing her sinthroid levels for years. The normal range is 6-12. If it's below 6, then he raises her meds. When we actually looked up the labs for the past 4 years, we noticed that her thyroid level was 78! The only reason we thought to check was because a new nurse practitioner called us in a panic to tell her to stop the medicine. I'm thinking that I should talk to a lawyer, and I probably will regardless. I just wanted to post here to see if that's the best recourse. Thanks!\n","answer":" Are we talking T4 values here?  If so, I would be downright shocked if your endo didn't notice that the lab values were 5x higher than they should be for years.  Here's what probably happened.  The labs usually report T4 values using a 5-12 range in ug\/dl.  However, because people like to be difficult, some labs report their values using ng\/ml.  Why is this important?  Because a 78 ng\/ml reading is actually a \"normal\" 7.8 in ug\/dl.\n\nSo go personally get a copy of the blood test results and see what reference range units they use.  \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a doctor or any other kind of medical professional.Answer #2: Talk to a lawyer.

{"question":"My friend's doctor perscribed her the medicines Lexapro and Trazodone. Even a simple google search would reveal that the two drugs are known to interact badly. Unfortunately, her parents did not check this and my friend ended up in the hospital for serotonin syndrome, which is exactly what Lexapro and Trazodone can result in.

Yes they can, but it’s rare. And you need to understand that each of these drugs have the potential for fairly severe side effects if prescribed on their own (as do most drugs to be honest).\n\nBut med mal is very fact based and a specialist area. Most med mal attorneys will offer a free consult, so that’s what you should probably do. Be aware, I suspect that this is not going to go anywhere - the reason you have found anecdotal stories about this interaction is a function of the fact that in some circumstances this is a good mix for patients. In other words, it’s acceptable prescribing practices. So by all means consult an attorney but don’t get your hopes up.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who ended up with mild serotonin syndrome just taking one antidepressant and I know how miserable and ill I was.

My problem is with my ex. \nSince Presidents day is tomorrow he didn't have school Friday nor does he have school tomorrow. My ex dropped him off at 2pm Friday because the court order states that my pick up begins at that time. She expects me to drop him off at 8 am tomorrow because the court order states that. It does not. It states that I must drop him off at school at 8 am. The judge and mediator explained that drop off and pick up are at school (it is not written in the court order because we both agreed in court). Though I drop him off at 8 am, he is still under my legal care until after school, which she picks him up and her time starts. She's saying that since he doesn't have school tomorrow I need to drop him off at her house or she will call the cops. \n\nI just need advice as to what to do or how to handle this situation. Does she have the right to have our son at 8?\nAnything will help.\nThank you \n\nEdit: Location, Southern California\n","answer":" It's debatable either way - and it is definitely something you should get some clarity written into the agreement for future times when this happens.\n\nBut do you really want to dig your heels in and fight her over it this time around. \n\nIs there a reason why you can't (or don't want to) drop him off at her house. \n\nCan you possibly even meet at the school and exchange custody there if you don't want to go to her house. \n\nMy advice would be to take the high road here and not get into an unnecessary argument.

{"question":"Looking for advice for Colorado Divorce cases... I have googled to no avail. \n\nHere is the shortened situation. Husband and Wife have been separated for almost 6 years and now would like to file and get a formal divorce. During their marriage, they had two children who are now school aged. For the last 4 years wife has had no contact with the children per her own choice, the door has always been opened on husbands side. \n\nNow that they would like a divorce she would like to file without including the children. She doesn't want to get hit with child support, and she would like the current parenting plan to stay as is. Obviously, this is not ideal for the Father as he would not have finalized custody papers, however, for the sake of this discussion, let's focus on just the filing without the kids. \n\nI was under the assumption that you had to include the children in the divorce process, but I am unsure if that is really the law. Any thoughts?\n","answer":" A petition for divorce must indicate all living children from the marriage. That doesn't necessarily mean the mother will pay child support."}
{"question":"My bf is originally from Canada, he has been living in the United States for the past ~6 years on a work visa. Earlier this year he quit his job at the company that he came here to work for (they have a branch in Canada and he started there) and almost immediately got a new job. This job is also on the up and up - he gets paid in check, pays taxes, etc. and has never been in legal trouble since he has been in the country. \n\nThe problem is that he never reported the job change, so last week when he went to Canada to visit family he had no trouble getting into Canada (of course, since he's a citizen), but on his way back to the US he was stopped at the border and the visa issue came up. I guess his visa was revoked for not reporting the job change or going through the proper channels to check if it was ok. Now he is stuck in Canada and as far as we know his options are a) have his new boss request a visa\/renewal for him? b) come get his belongings and return to Canada and he will be banned from entering the US for five years. Is there an option c here that we are missing? How likely is it that he will be able to get it settled and come home? I'm sure this is a stupid question and it's been asked here a million times, but would marrying an American help the process? \n\nI don't know how visas between US and Canada work at all; I am familiar with immigration laws and such between US and Mexico, but I'm assuming that's a whole different, way more complicated ballgame and am hoping Canada may be a little less restrictive. But like I said, I don't know. I am just looking for any advice that I can pass onto him so we can figure this out as quickly as possible. \n","answer":" Bump to crosspost to \/r\/immigration and www.visajourney.com.\n\nYour boyfriend needs the services of an immigration lawyer due to his failure to report his employer update to USCIS. US immigration officials take updates in status very seriously (e.g., immigrants on permanent residence status have to report \/every\/ time they move until they've got their citizenship paperwork in hand). His failure to notify the US government isn't USCIS' problem, it's his. The border agents were within their rights to bar him entry.\n\nSince he's in Canada, he will want to consult with someone skilled with US immigration law. They're pretty common in the larger cities. Alternately if you are in the US, you can seek an AILA referral.\n\nCanada\/US have several NAFTA-related programs for visas, but don't expect this to be a cakewalk. It's not. He needs to consult with a lawyer to scope out the options, whether he might foul reapplication by having his new employer fill out the work visa request with this on his record, and whatnot.\n\n**Do not** marry him to try to secure his permanent residency. A ban applies across the board if levied. A marriage of convenience to gain him status will throw all kinds of red flags for immigration officials and could escalate to a lifetime ban if you're found to be fraudulently marrying to circumvent the system. Obviously if you were midway through wedding plans, the answer might be a little different (like why weren't you sponsoring him or filing a concurrent petition for alien spouse\/permanent residency). Right now, though, he's got a big red mark of 'losing work visa' that a marriage won't help with. \n\nTL;DR: Get a competent US immigration lawyer for him in Canada to help see the best path."}

{"question":"I'm in Alabama\n\nSo, I bought \"Alpha Training Collars\" for my dog and puppy. I mainly bought them for the vibration (I think shock is mean, and they respond to the vibration well). It cost me just over $100. \n\nBoth of my dogs are medium\/small (20 lbs). The collars are Huge (meant to be one size fit all), and the only way to make them fit is to tighten them and cut the slack. Which is what I did, now I didn't know you have to burn the ends so it doesn't fray (yeah, I may be a bit dumb, but none of this is in the collar instructions, its just like here, good luck). \n\nWithin a day the puppy's frayed and fell off. The dogs stayed, but only because I literally stapled it. I contacted them for replacement collars in which they then inform me to burn the ends, and that they will send a replacement.\n\nAwesome.

{"question":"My neighbor claims that he had a surveyor come out and check property lines.  According to what he's said, the property line is not where our fence line (fence does not extend to the street, but separates the back yards) is but 5 feet into my yard.  He says that he wants to build a fence between the houses out to the sidewalk.  I asked him to see the report from his surveyor as proof.  He instantly got defensive, and said that I need to pay my own surveyor to do so.  He refuses to provide proof.  There were no flags set to show the delineation in my yard like I would think a legit professional would do. There are several red flags to this story that have my bullshit alarms screaming.\n\nMy next 3 steps are to call the county assessor office and see if I can get someone to figure out what's going on.

Then, once I'm armed with info, lawyer up (if the title insurance company doesn't provide one)\n\nIs there anything I'm missing as far as steps moving forward?   Anyone else that needs to be consulted?\n","answer":" You're on the right track. Have your own survey done. Your surveyor may be able to contact your neighbor's surveyor to obtain a copy if your neighbor continues to refuse to give you a copy of his. Answer #2: He is probably trying to manipulate you into paying for a proper survey so HE knows the boundary line for a planned fence. No survey Co would do a instrument survey or boundary without marking the line with red steaks. So his story is bogus. So what you should do is call the building department and ask if a permit is needed for a fence, not all jurisdictions require a permit. Once you know this, call your lawyer or any lawyer to write a letter stating a you feel the current boundary line is in dispute. Any fence put up on a disputed boundary line will result in litigation. Now offer to have a NEW proper instrument survey done with steak markers by a mutual agreed ed licensed company, or have two surveys one by you and one by him to agree on the final boundary line. Then a fence can be installed."}
{"question":"Location: CA, USA\n\nI originally signed a 1 year lease which I honored. After the 1 year lease, I received a notice showing that I was switching to a month-to-month lease and that the rent would increase by a specified amount. I was asked to sign the lease, which I did. It locked me into a month-to-month rate. 1 year later, I receive another notice for another increase to my month-to-month rate starting the following month. \n\nThis time I ignore the notice and the landlord continues to bill the previously agreed monthly rent (using an online web based system).

I kill that person. Can I be tried again for their murder ?\n","answer":" Yes, you can be tried again.  \n\n\nKilling Seymour Butz on June 11th in Central Park is a different crime than killing Seymour Butz on August 15th in the Grand Canyon. The double jeopardy clause protects against successive trials for the same crime, not for two different crimes.  \n\n\nAnd a moment's thought would make this clear.  \n\n\nSuppose the crime was robbery. If you steal Seymour Butz's wallet on June 11th in Central Park, do you imagine that you're immune from a robbery charge when you steal his wallet  on August 15th in the Grand Canyon?Answer #2: Nothing would prevent you from being charged for killing the person after your release.  An erroneous conviction and sentence do not negate responsibility for actual crimes subsequently committed even in the event of it being the same basic criminal act you were previously convicted for in error."}

The fact that it is 18 pages long tells me it was probably drafted by someone who knows what they are doing.

He has been in prison for several years and will likely get out soon. He will register as a sex offender. We are now divorced and I've obviously had custody of our daughter since he went to prison.

Like I said, my ex plead to assault with intent of sexual abuse, a crime which does not include any sort of child abuse aspect. My concern is that our daughter is now at the same stage of development as the girl my ex molested. Is it more likely that a family court judge will take the whole story into account when deciding custody, or will they only be able to consider what he was actually charged with? To put it another way, will he be more likely to get custody because he pled to sexual assault and not sexual assault of a minor (which would make him more of an immediate threat to our daughter)? \n","answer":" NAL, but I have read about similar situations. Your ex will not ever get custody of your daughter. You may rest assured of that. \n\nIf he is granted visitation, it would have to be under strict supervision by at least a social worker, whether it’s in-person or by video. "}
{"question":"I know I am being bullying and I can't do anything about it. Why? \n\nIf I do I get more quizes\/tests randomly or that is what I am afraid of. What does this person do? Well its my teacher, the current teacher made fun of me in front of the class whenever I had a question. As well as call me out in class just to joke at me.  I was paying attention the whole time. Another teacher misguided me as my \"adviser\", telling me to take a wrong course. When I confronted she told me to still take this course. Then, the same teacher wouldn't overtally for a class I know she had room in (she overtalled for my friend). \n\n I know that I made one mistake with one teacher, and a couple of small errors with other teachers.  Like saying the wrong things, I made one huge mistake where I pissed off a teacher I understand that.  I try to avoid them but, I can't do that 100%.

{"question":"I'm in a real pickle here. I recently moved into a garage unit, I have a lot of stuff (tables and furniture, as well as workshop equipment. I really enjoy living in my workshop and would like it to continue that way. My landlord recently found out it's \"illegal\" to live in the garage unit. She has this decided to move me into another room, one which my items will NEVER fit in, as well as I can not get work done. I have a six month lease signed with her. Naturally I am looking for a new place but chances are I won't be able to find one in time. I get that she might get subjected to fines, but I paid to live here and this is extremely stressful and time wasting for me. Obviously this breaks our rental agreement.\n\nIs there any way I can stay in the garage? What is the legal definition of habitation?

{"question":"So around December, when I was coming home from college for the holidays, I applied to Kohl’s for some seasonal work. Shortly after sending in my application, I was able to set up an interview, so to me they appeared interested in having me fill a seasonal position. I go in for the interview, and before I am even allowed to speak to my interviewer, I was forced to sign up for a Kohl’s credit card, as the employees claim that that is how they apply the employee discount. I fill it out having now been put under the impression that the interview would simply be a formality, as the very fact I am being asked to sign up for the Kohl’s credit card means I’ll be needing to use it for the employee discount. Then I go into the interview, where my interviewer only asks to tell her a bit about myself. Once I’m done with my short list of facts about me, she tells me, rather frankly, that they would not be hiring me and they never planned on hiring me, as they finished hiring for seasonal positions more than a week prior. Do I have any legal recourse, or any way to report this highly unethical behavior? Or am I stuck with this credit card based on lies forever? Any advice would be much appreciated!\n\nTLDR: I was forced to sign up for a store credit card under the false pretense of an employee discount to gain access to an interview for a position I was never going to get. Seems at the very least extremely unethical. Any legal options available here?\n","answer":" I find this bizarre that they would \"force\" you. Perhaps there was a miscommunication because Kohl's does give a discount for everyone when you pay with a Kohl's card.\n\nYou may complain to corporate, but there's no legal recourse.

{"question":"I live in Seattle which is a very \"progressive\" place for bikers, and was coming home from a dinner date with my GF.

{"question":"This began Monday. I'm in Hillsborough County, Florida. I'm looking for a mother-in-law suite or roommate arrangement while I pursue my philosophy PhD. I met with the owner of a townhouse, who lives there. This man is 48, a clerk in a paint store, his parents gave him the home. We hash out the details and I call him the next day to confirm the arrangement. The next day he asks to meet for dinner Thursday evening.

{"question":"Hello,\nBecause of a lot of financial mistakes many years ago I have both old tax debt and defaulted student loans. I am current on my tax filings but still owe taxes from 2006. But My bigger concern is the DEFAULTED student loans. They have been going from collection company to collection company.\nIs it possible to file bankruptcy out of this mess and get a fresh start? It is nearly impossible for me to pay back the student loans in the amounts they want. The student loans are from 1984-1990. I'm in Minnesota and I'm turning 49 this year.\n","answer":" Student loans are almost rarely dischargeable in bk and it has to be a chapter 7. You can meet with a bankruptcy attorney to see if it's right for you.  The general advice would be \"don't count on it\" when it comes to your defaulted loans.  One of the big reasons it's relatively easy to get student loans and the interest rates are low is because they are almost never dischargeable. Answer #2: &gt; Discharge in Bankruptcy\n\n&gt; This is not an automatic process—you must prove to the bankruptcy court that repaying your student loan would cause undue hardship.\n\n&gt; If you file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may have your loan discharged in bankruptcy only if the bankruptcy court finds that repayment would impose undue hardship on you and your dependents. This must be decided in an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court. Your creditors may be present to challenge the request. The court uses this three-part test to determine hardship:\n\n&gt; * If you are forced to repay the loan, you would not be able to maintain a minimal standard of living.\n\n&gt; * There is evidence that this hardship will continue for a significant portion of the loan repayment period.\n\n&gt; * You made good-faith efforts to repay the loan before filing bankruptcy (usually this means you have been in repayment for a minimum of five years).\n\n&gt; **Your loan will not be discharged if you are unable to satisfy any one of the three requirements.**\n\n&gt; If your loan is discharged, you will not have to repay any portion of your loan, and all collection activity will stop. You also will regain eligibility for federal student aid if you had previously lost it."}

You can (and probably should) consult your own private lawyer.Answer #2: This is a great example of how a witness can use the 5th amendment. I would go to the police station in person with print outs of the relevant emails, provide them to the police, and file a report stating your relationship to the defendant and that he is planning on doing \"X\" (they'll want to see those emails and may not act if they don't get them). If they ask how you got the emails, tell them \"I invoke my fifth amendment right against self incrimination.\"\n\nThey'll suspect you probably accessed it illegally but you won't have made any admissions admissible in court and to be honest they'll probably be so happy to have the evidence that they won't try to build a case against you. You see, they'd need a warrant to get the emails from his account themselves, but if you provide them, even if you got them illegally, the police didn't violate the 4th amendment to get them so they are probably admissible. In my experience, cops hate the restrictive nature of the 4th amendment so they'll be very happy with you in all likelihood. \n"}

I really don't know how this was possible as I live in an entirely different state as my mother and have not lived with her in 8 years (I currently live in NY while she lives in NJ)\n\nAs you can see just by the example above I never know what she is capable of since she knows my information through and through. I just need help finding out what she has connected to my name as I never know until it is to late whether it's turning up on my credit report in debt collections or if it's a guy literally knocking on my door to repo her car. Who should I see to rectify this problem please any information\/help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. \n","answer":" Your mom is committing fraud and identity theft.\n\nHave you reported this to the police?Answer #2: You need to file a police report for the identity theft your mother has been committing and report the fraudulent accounts to the banks and whomever else she opened accounts with.  \n\nYou can also put an alert in your credit reports.\n\nYou can get copies of your credit reports through the reporting agencies.   These will show where your credit stands and what is open in your name.  Answer #3: Your mother is screwing you over, royally. And you’re worried about her facing her own consequences? There aren’t very many options for you aside from talking to police. You’re protecting someone who clearly doesn’t care about the effects of their actions on you. Answer #4: Freeze your credit for starters. Like right now. Answer #5: There are two options:\n\nYou pay the debt as yours and she keeps doing it.\n\nYou report her to the police, report accounts as fraudulent and she goes to jail.\nAnswer #6: Stop being a victim Answer #7: First off, STOP PAYING HER DAMN DEBTS. By doing so, you've implicated yourself as being responsible for them. Now contact the authorities and report her for fraud. Answer #8: call the police or pay your mother's bills for the rest of your life, your choice dude.Answer #9: If you don't want to involve the police you need to have a very frank talk with her.  That's your only recourse beyond involving the police, so if she doesn't listen then your only remaining choices are:\n\n1. Accept the financial abuse.\n\n2. Involve the police.\n"}

{"question":"So I work for a company that visits several locations across the city (Phoenix AZ) throughout the day. At the beginning of the day I commute to the shop, help the technician put their van together for the day, then drive to several locations to clean carpets. The technician gets paid commission per job, but I get paid hourly. The company policy is basically after the last job of the day I am off the clock. This sometimes leads to an unpaid hour drive back to the shop where my car is. I have talked to my boss about this but he is adamant that I am no longer doing productive work for the company, so I am no longer on the clock. I have done a bit of research and it seems like there are federal laws stating I am not off the clock until I get back to the shop. \n\nI am planning on confronting my boss here soon, but I am worried rather then change the job culture (there are a few other helpers) it would be easier to fire me or just ignore my request. I also want to be 100% sure that this behaviour is in fact illegal. Any advice would be greatly appreciated\n","answer":" Your boss is very wrong.

{"question":"My partner and I just moved to Oregon and when we moved in we got a pretty long and complex list of specific instructions regarding the plumbing. Essentially the story was \"old house, small pipes, flush as little as possible.\" This included a pretty strong recommendation that we dispose of used TP in bins rather than flush it as well as \"use this very specific brand of TP.\"\n\nThe plumbing does seem to be temperamental but my question is even if we follow her instructions to a reasonable degree (throwing away used TP in a bin in the bathroom is not sanitary and thus not happening) and there's a problem with the plumbing how much are we responsible for?\n\nMy suspicion is the landlord knows the plumbing is dodgy and wants to be able to blame us for any issues to avoid having to pay for any potentially expensive fixes. When I did home repairs for landlords previously this was a pretty common scam that landlords ran; avoid fixing problems and neglect to tell tenants about them fully so that when something does break the landlord can claim it was the tenant who broke it and is therefore responsible.\n","answer":" &gt;throwing away used TP in a bin in the bathroom is not sanitary and thus not happening\n\nPeople do that all the time and it is fine in terms of sanitation. If you ignore the instructions they give you and something goes wrong you are taking a risk that you're going to be responsible for the repair.

{"question":"I'm in the United States. California, if that's relevant. I know that via durable power of attorney, one can appoint someone to make medical decisions in the case of an emergency.  However, I want to know if there is a way to, without specifically appointing anyone, to deny that right to specific people.  \n\nI do not get along well with my family.  We have very different points of views on what is and isn't right for my own well being, morals, etc.  I do not want them to have the ability to override my judgement if I am in an emergency, or unable to communicate.  I also do not have anyone I would like to give power of attorney to (I'm young, don't have any life partners, friends close enough to give this to).  \n\n**TLDR:** I do not want my family to, in any context, make any medical decisions about me.

That’s not going to fly. I think what you want to say is that they had no cause to arrest him in the first place. But the truth is - you fight that battle in the courtroom rather than the street. Because of just such an example. It wasn’t his place to resist arrest at all. He should have just submitted and then argued the toss in court. He might not have been guilty of the crime they were originally trying to arrest him on, but it sounds like he did resist."}

{"question":" \n\nI  just wondered what i'm legally allowed to do if I'm out walking in the  park and a person randomly kicks my dog or another dog comes out of no  where and starts attacking my dog?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n","answer":" As another commenter has said, pets will be considered personal property. \n\nA person has a right to protect their personal property so long as it is reasonable.  \n\nSo it will depend on the situation.  \n\nFor example, if you’re walking your dog and then another dog comes and attacks your dog and you kick that dog in the face... this would be reasonable if it was a large dog.  However, let’s say the attacking dog was a chihuahua, kicking that dog in the face might not be reasonable, because you could have pulled your dog away or possibly shove the chihuahua with your foot. \n\nSo it’ll depend on what most people would do in the situation.  Answer #2: I'm not too sure but since dogs are considered their owners' property, you would treat it like you would treat the protection of your house?? I'm not sure, just spectating Answer #3: One clarification to make here is that you have the right to defend your dog DURING or to prevent the attack once attempts to attack have been made. NOT AFTER. So if someone comes up and kicks your dog, unless there's an indication they're about to have another go at another kick, you cannot use self-defense if that threat is no longer there. Answer #4: Oddly, I was contemplating a similar scenario recently.\n\nSuppose I am publicly walking my, let's say a pitbull, past a home. The owner of that home comes out with a gun, telling about how these killer dogs shouldn't be in this neighborhood and he appears as though he is about to shoot my dog. I am also armed. Would I have a legal right to protect the life of my dog through the use of deadly force? "}

{"question":"We live in Tarrant County, Texas. My sister's roommate gave us her old washer and dryer to replace our older washer and dryer. Sunday afternoon, the moving company that the roommate hired brought them to us and installed them both, but it felt like they were rushing things to get out of there. They left and forgot to turn the water back on, which I realized when I tried to give the washer a test run.\n\nToday (Tuesday), I discovered that the floor in the laundry room had water under it. In addition, the wall of my bathroom was wet, and a puddle has formed behind the toilet (laundry room and bathroom are back-to-back). I turn off the washer's water valve and my sister called a plumber for me. He found out that the washer's connection to the house's water valve wasn't tightened and was leaking water when turned on, and he was able to turn it a good 5 or so times to tighten it. My sister also had to call a carpet cleaner company to come dry the affected floors and walls, which they're doing now.\n\nMy sister called the movers and told them the situation and asked for reimbursement for the plumber and the floor cleaner fees (almost $500, possibly more if we need to rent the cleaners' equipment for additional days). They refused, saying that it wasn't their fault since they weren't the ones that turned on the valve. They also said that if they really didn't tighten it, then it would've leaked while they were there (it didn't leak while they were there because they forgot to turn on the water though). My sister decides that she'll have to take them to small claims court.\n\nSo I'm not exactly familiar with how these proceedings work, so what exactly should we do here? I feel like we have somewhat of a solid case, but I don't want anything to go wrong. Do they have a case for anything with the point of \"we didn't turn on that valve, we can't be responsible?\" I want to say it sounds stupid, but I could be wrong. Any advice?\n\nEDIT: Added location\n","answer":" Honestly, movers are not trained to install appliances.

{"question":"Some background: I am currently pregnant working in a field where I'm at a desk all day, so my pregnancy doesn't affect my physical ability to work at all. However, I've been having issues walking long distances without passing out and\/or feeling faint. \n\nMy office has 2 maternity spots right out in front that are usually taken so I don't get to use them. It also has a close parking garage  (which requires a red parking pass) that I don't have a pass to use.

I have had a hard time accomplishing this without having to take breaks and am worried about hurting myself. \n\nI asked HR if I could get a closer parking spot for during my pregnancy. I was informed that \"If you have a medical condition (example some type of complication due to pregnancy) preventing you from walking from the orange lot you can get with your doctor and have them send a note stating the reason for you not being able to walk that distance. Then we will verify with the doctor that you are unable to walk from the orange lot. After that is complete we can issue you a temporary red pass.\"\n\nMy doctor wrote me a note requesting special maternity parking. I'm just not really comfortable with my work requesting personal medical information about me.

{"question":"I work as a call center employee accepting claims for a large insurance provider, not healthcare related, but I do not want to be more specific. Obviously I can not prove whether some of these things are intentional to save the company money or if it really is poorly designed software. Basically the software deletes customer data and claim information all the time. It may effect relatively few people, but for some people their claim is never paid out unless they make dozens of calls. We press buttons that do nothing and assure the customer their payments are on their way, no one you talk to is being malicious, but for lack of better words your account is broken and can not be fixed. For some customers the entire record of their claim becomes obfuscated or deleted in a way that others who are less experienced at looking at the data will insist the customer has never had any business with us and their calls will get terminated over and over until they get the right person. \n\nI understand that insurance companies are looking to profit, we deny quite a lot of claims for a lot of ridiculous reasons, but these are approved claims that we have come to some agreement with another person that they should be reimbursed\/paid. I have seen quite a few people who make calls to us weekly for a period of half a year to resolve their claim.\n","answer":" Not a lawyer, but I work in insurance IT. This wouldn't be accepted at my company, but making policy systems and claims systems talk to each other can be extremely complicated. Your company probably has about 5-10 legacy policy systems sitting out there AND customers who have NO electronic policies at all.

{"question":"My now ex-fiance and I had a ba breakup mid last year and it never apparently settled with her. I moved on and got a new girlfriend a few months later and have been dating her ever since. My ex is constantly causing issues with both my girlfriend and I. She continuously calls and texts both of us, has confronted us at my girlfriends place of employment, and has even tried to have our (my exs and I) daughter lead her to my girlfriends residence. In december she even caused in incident between us which resulted in her getting multiple domestic violence charges against her, requiring her to attend counseling and a court order for no contact between us besides text and email regarding our child. She still texts about topics unrelated to our daughter, and calls under the guise of wanting to speak to our daughter, but then asking her to hand the phone to me. After that she moved out of state since she could not get a job and a place to live. \n\nAnyways, I am handling my issues with her through the legal system since those options are much more clear and obvious. The problem is that she will not stop harassing my current girlfriend. I got a text earlier from her saying my ex called her cellphone five times then called her at her job.\n\nSo what can my girlfriend do now? I am thinking an injunction against harassment is about the only option, and that seems pretty weak and easy to break. My ex constantly uses google voice phone numbers to call and text us since it cant be tracked back to her, or blocks her number from caller id so it doesn't appear that she called us. \nPlease help. \n\n","answer":" She is violating a no-contact order. \n\nTalk to the DA about what next steps are. \n\nAnd in the meantime, document document document every interaction.

{"question":"On Friday morning I was suppose to get a surgery done on my knee.. Very simple out patient procedure. \nAnyways, when they were prepping me, the nurse inserted the iv in my hand, and immediately I started feeling woozy and ended up having a seizure. \nI had to stay the night, getting brain related test done bc I've never had one (all of the test came back normal). \nI had 3 witnesses in the room who all states at multiple times the seizure happened immediately after the iv was injected and the nurse later told the neurologist that it happened 10 mins later.  Which is a completely lie. I also saw spaces in between the liquid they were putting in me which I now suspect they were bubbles and that's the reason I had the seizure.

It is highly recommended to speak with a medical malpractice attorney; your state's bar may be able to refer you to one. They typically work on contingency, meaning there is little up front cost to you. Similarly, consultations are typically free. It wouldn't hurt to meet with one, have them look over your info, and go from there.Answer #2: It would take an IV line full of air to cause any problems.  Some bubbles in it are no problem at all.  \n\nHad you ever had an IV before?Answer #3: I get IV infusions every month, for years, air in the line (unless it's an extreme as in full line amount) is harmless.

{"question":"A little more backstory:\n\nThis was at the entrance of a large department store chain in Indiana. She slipped and hit both knees hard on the ground. She initially thought it was just badly bruised but it turns up she actually fractured her knee. Unfortunately, she didn't take any pictures or talk to any of the staff at the time. She was in so much pain she just left. This has been about 3-4 days ago now. \n\nIs there anything that she can do as far as at least hospital bills? She doesn't have any evidence herself, but could there be security camera footage? Or is it too late for any of that now? They had one of the slippery when wet signs, but shouldn't they have taken better precautions? Most stores usually have lots of rugs laid out when the weather is really bad. Any advice would be welcomed; thanks in advance!\n","answer":" She can talk to an attorney.  Her testimony is evidence, albeit self-serving evidence and probably not enough alone.  There is no way we could possible know if there is camera footage, but if there is it would be better to get this started now so that it does not get deleted.  Also, there is no way for us to know if the store should have done more.  Maybe the slippery condition existed for 30 seconds and someone had not yet noticed it.  Nobody here knows.  That is one of the things that a lawyer would help figure out.  It also may not matter, depending on the state's tort laws.  Talk to a lawyer.\n\n"}

{"question":"Question arose from a news article in Florida. Recently, a Florida gun shop owner \"won\" a legal case of discrimination against his store, when a judge dismissed the case against him.\n\n[Case in Question](http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2015\/nov\/28\/florida-muslim-free-gun-shop-owner-wins-discrimina\/)\n\nThe story goes like this: Following the shootings of four service men in Chattanooga, TN, by an Islamic extremist, a gun shop owner in Florida posted a sign on his store declaring that the store is a \"Muslim-Free\" zone and that he would not serve Muslims. This  rustled a few jimmies and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Florida filed suite.\n\nThe suit was recently tossed out due to the facts that the sign was a sign only (protected under first amendment) and that no one was actually discriminated against, as no Muslim was actually denied service at the gun shop. Can't say I blame them for not wanting to test how serious the owner was about this ban.\n\nMy question is, regardless of personal opinion (the owner seems like a grade-A asshat to me), is this type of distinction legal? Does a shop owner truly have the \"right to refuse service to anyone\", including the members of an entire religion? Or, can they only discriminate as long as the refusal is against an individual and not against an entire protected class (is there even a protected class here, or is that only for such things as employment)?\n","answer":" No, you cannot discriminate based on religion when offering a service to the general public."}

Because of this I have decided to champion housing issues as a student rep and am working on several programs to deal with these issues. \nThe specific program I have questions about is a lease review program. In this program students from student legal society would receive training from our student hired lawyer as to what to look for in a lease when reviewing it for legality and applicability. From there we would work as a group to review students leases that they bring to us or we seek out and not give them any advice other then if they should seek input from our student hired lawyer or not. \nThis is one of several programs and I am curious of the legality or possibility of such a program to gather information as to how landlords are working within our university neighborhood.

{"question":"If my fiance's ex-wife changes her mailing address to our new house, would she have gained any legal power over us?  Like installing camera legally or whatever?  She is an attorney and treats him like dirt whenever she likes. She is also moving soon to a home within a block of us.  She love to fight with him and it's very uncomfortable for both of us.  It appears she has had her mail forwarded her and I can't think of why she would do that.

{"question":"Is it against the law for me [17F] to speak in a sexually explicit way (no images invovled) to a friend [33M] if we both consent?

We have no intentions of meeting up in real life.\n\nI would really appreciate any information about this as I have not been successful with finding any online so far. Thank you.\n","answer":" Whilst its' legal its' not great that your 33 year old friend is willing to do this with a 17 year old.  'Technically legal' doesn't really make this okay.  I'm pretty sure he's fielding the question through you and not posting it himself because he knows he'd get backlash for what he's doing."}
{"question":"I work in a kennel and a dog bit my hand earlier today. I told my boss about it and after we cleaned it up, he told me it didn't look that bad. He made a few phone calls and then told me not to go to the emergency room several times. I called him a few minutes ago to tell him I'm not coming in tomorrow since it's getting worse and he emphasized that I should not go to the ER and that I could use his doctor if I want to see someone.\n\nThis whole situation seems a little fishy to me. On one hand (Pun totally intended), my hand is very important to me and I would be unhappy if something bad happened to it because I didn't get it treated properly. On the other hand, I might be overreacting as I've never been bitten by an animal before and I don't want to unnecessarily screw my boss over, even if he might not have my best interest in mind.\n\nCould someone maybe clarify what my boss is so worried about? Keep in mind that I wouldn't want to go to the ER even if he didn't mention it because I'm broke and live in the land of the free. I'm just worried that his reaction might be a result of a bigger mess he's not telling me about that might come back to hurt me in the future.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI went to the ER. They gave me a tetanus shot and a prescription for some antibiotics. They said that most bites get infected, but that I'll probably be back to normal in a few days.\n\nI probably would not have gone if it weren't for you guys. It was definitely worth it for the peace of mind.\n\nNow I just have to give my boss a form to fill out to pay for my bill. That's definitely going to be fun and not get me yelled at\/fired lol.\n","answer":" He doesn't want you filing a workers compensation claim.  Not too mention, the incident could likely affect his insurance.  There might be reporting requirements for an attack that he wants to avoid.  Lastly, in some cases it is necessary to destroy the animal for testing.  If it belongs to a client, he would want to avoid this at all costs.  He is screwing you, in order to cover his ass.\n\nA bite from a dog, especially one that you are not completely familiar with and confident in its medical history, is a big deal.  You may require a painful round of anti-rabies drugs.\n\nAs for being broke, as this was a workplace accident, your employer should be picking up the tab.Answer #2: Head to the ER.  If a bite on the hand gets infected, you could lose function in your hand.  Answer #3: Please update that you went to the ER. The bite will get infected. Cat bit my finger once, got infected and I had blood poisoning less than 12 hours later, red lines going up my finger and all."}

{"question":"Location: California\n\nHi, I received my first DUI yesterday. My BAC was .09. The police officer that pulled me over told me that he saw me run a red light. I completely forget a certain street had a no turn on red sign. It was very dark, so I didn't see it like normally. He also told me I was speeding at 100 MPH. He said it took him a while to catch up to me.\n\nHe and the officers he was with had me do field tests and never told me if I passed them or not. I'm not sure what they look for. I took the breathalyzer test twice after and after the second test they told me I was under arrest. I was not brought to jail, but to a first time offender program where I slept for the night.\n\nI understand what I did was wrong and going forward I will live life without drinking and driving. What I'm wondering is what should I do now? My court date is two months away. I currently have around $6k saved up. I know of wet and reckless, but I'm not sure if I'll qualify because of the speed they said that I did and running the red light.\n\nThank you.\n","answer":" Hire a lawyer. Do you have any paperwork stating specifically what you are charged with?\n\nDriving at 100MPH drunk running at least one red definitely has the potential to be an especially serious DUI charge.

{"question":"So I stayed at a friends place out of town overnight, and the next day I came back to find a package delivered the day before that was clearly torn open.  All contents were inside.  It was a $40 necklace, so clearly not worth stealing, which is probably why it was returned.  There are tons of cameras everywhere in my apartment building, so the management went through the tape and found the culprit.  Unfortunately, they are unaware of exactly who it is (honestly - I don't think they want to tell me) and are working to figure out his name.\n\nI am wondering what I can do at this point.  It was clearly done with the intent to steal my package, but probably once he realized it was a worthless item, he chose to return it hoping I'd think it was a delivery guys fault (except I know the delivery guy... so he told me directly he put it down with no rips).  Is there anything I can charge him with?  Or will\/should the management do something like show the police?  Can\/should I request that?

{"question":"So I am in the US military (stationed in Washington State) and my fiancé and I would like to secretly(not inform our families) elope on the first, as I am getting deployed a few days later. Anyone familiar with the military will know about all the benefits of being married in the military such as BAH and FSA while I’m deployed. We are planning a large open wedding in July when I get back. We brought up the courthouse wedding idea to get our much needed financial benefits sooner rather than later to our families and my (military family) understood, her parents lashed out saying that if we did we’d have to pay them back for the wedding(I know legally we wouldn’t have to but we don’t want to burn that bridge).  So I went to my base legal office and looked into ways they could find out, which is why we want to do it in 2018 since claiming her on my 2017 taxes would pose an obvious risk of either fraud or her parents finding out (she is a full time student so still technically her parents dependent). So the big question here is if we get married is there anything I missed that might give us away to our parents. She is concerned about health insurance since she is on her fathers plan currently and is worried that he will get in trouble if we get married and he doesn’t know and she stays on his plan until she and I “get married” in July. I don’t intend on signing her up for Tricare(military medical insurance) until July. I hope I didn’t miss anything.\n\nHonestly neither one of us particularly want the July wedding. Her mother does and she is their only daughter blah blah blah. But we are too far in now. As they have already spent money on down payments and things for the wedding to say don’t worry about paying for a big wedding.\nTopic:\nInsurance\n","answer":" People have separate civil and religious ceremonies pretty regularly. There's nothing illegal about it - as far as the law's concerned, the only meaningful bit of your wedding is the part where you sign the paperwork in front of an officiant and witnesses.\n\nIf your fiancé's parents are willing to pay for her wedding on the condition that she does not have a separate legal wedding, that's their right. Neither of you are entitled to have them pay for your wedding, and they can put more or less any condition on their help that they want: if you don't like it, say no. You can't have it both ways: if you lie to them to get them to pay for something, that's fraud, and if you lie to the government to get marital benefits when you're not married, that's _also_ fraud.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, someone's family members can request copies of their marriage paperwork from city hall without any special permission. In a few jurisdictions, marriages are still published regularly. There is a real chance your fiancé's parents will know when she gets married."}
{"question":"Last Friday night I was leaving a bar in Austin, TX to go home. Just outside the bar was a Lime scooter that was unlocked ready to ride. Typically if you want to ride one you must download the app, take a picture of your drivers license, agree to terms and conditions\/ liability waiver, etc. However, like I said, the scooter was already unlocked by a previous driver. So I hopped on and cruised into the darkness while my friends wrangled our Uber. The next thing I know I’m in the ER and my face is throbbing. I can’t remember exactly how I fell because the concussion caused severe amnesia. There is a possibility the scooter locked on me mid ride. I didn’t remember anything for the next 2-3 hours immediately following the incident. My friends described me as Dory from finding Nemo as I my brain would sort of reset every couple of minutes and I would ask them why my face was hurting. So 5 Uber rides, 2 private ER facilities, 2 CT scans, 4 points of fracture in my face, 7 stitches, and $2,100 worth of medical bills later, I finally got home to rest. The doctor recommended I see an ENT doctor or plastic surgeon within the next week to see if I will need surgery as one of my fractures left a fleck of cheek bone in my sinus cavity. I do not have health insurance. \n\nSo my question to you, redditors, is if I have any sort of case here to sue Lime for monetary compensation.\n","answer":" You're asking if you can sue the owners of the scooter you stole because you crashed it while drunk?Answer #2: So, let's net this out:\n\n* You were drunk\n* You left a bar, and stole a scooter\n* You weren't wearing any safety gear\n* You crashed the scooter, injuring yourself\n* And you want to sue someone\n\nNo, you have no case.Answer #3: No, you don't have a case.

{"question":"My father died 20 years ago of a sudden heart attack. One week before he died, we reconciled after ten years of not seeing or speaking to each other.  He told me that he wished he could change his estate, but he had made it an irrevocable trust that couldn't be changed, and that my two brothers were in it, but I wasn't. I was working at a high-paying job at the time and told him all I wanted from him was to be back in communication, so of course when he died a week later, I was devastated.\n\nFlash forward a few weeks.  Turns out he either hid or destroyed his will, because nobody could find it. And when there's no will, the estate goes intestate, with all the siblings getting an equal share. But that wasn't to be.\n\nFlash forward to me in a lawyer's office conference room. My brothers and I each had attorneys, and the purpose of the meeting was to negotiate 'how much I was going to get' from the 15 million he had set up for his children. (His second wife also got 15 million, and my mother got very little).\n\nMy lawyer and I were astonished that my brothers didn't want to divide up the 15 million between the three of us.  Because I was grieving losing my father right after getting him back in my life, I ended up settling for 500k.\n\nFlash forward 20 years. I'm now a writer, and my finances are up and down. Now that I'm 59 years old, I'm starting to think about my retirement, something my brothers don't have to worry about.\n\nI realize the statute of limitations is way past, but is there any way I can sue them for cruel and unusual punishment? (Or anything else?)  Part of the reason for my brothers’ animosity is because I'm transgender, which was a much bigger deal twenty years ago.\n\nMy father died in Chicago, where the trust issues were settled. One brother now lives in Texas, and the other in Kentucky. I now live in Arkansas.  \n\nI've worked my ass off all my life and they haven't had to. Is there any way I can sue them?\n\n","answer":" Uhhh, you settled for $500k. What makes you think you have any valid claim now? Being transgendered has no relevance here, not sure why you even mentioned it. Answer #2: &gt;I realize the statute of limitations is way past, but is there any way I can sue them for cruel and unusual punishment? \n\nNo.  Preventing the re-litigating of old matters like this is exactly why we have a statute of limitations.  Besides the fact that legal matters have to have a definite end at some point so people can move on with their lives, memories fade, papers get lost, and the reliability of any resolution becomes increasingly questionable.\n\nYou chose to settle back then.  You can't sue now for something arising out of the same matter.  Take what comfort you can from knowing what your father wanted, and move on.Answer #3: I think the main point you are missing is that if the assets were in an irrevocable trust then they are guided by the trust deed and his will is irrelevant anyway."}

The officer took both our licenses, spent quite a while in his car with them, and then told us to leave without saying anything about a ticket or anything or any charges.

Thanks in advance.\n","answer":" Has she been evaluated for post-partum depression? \n\nThere is a very very good chance you would be awarded joint legal custody; what the physical custody would look like, given your job schedule and the baby's age, is hard to say, but certainly you have a good case for at least some visitation."}

I am also a little nervous that the site was illegal. It boasted 12,000 pictures and the banner was all adults, but I am nervous that this site was illegal and monitored by the FBI. I think I made this worse by searching if the site was legal or linked by major search engines.

They're not under arrest, their rights have not been restricted by the courts, and they're not under any kind of guardianship.\n\nHowever, if you don't cooperate with the requirements of the program, then the program cannot protect you.

{"question":"Hello, \n\nI was baffled by my local Gamestop trying to return a video game. On December 28th, 4:46 PM I bought a used game. Before purchasing the game, I asked about the return policy. The clerk told me that I had seven days to return the game if I didn't like it. The receipt I received, which I still have, states the same. Today I walked into Gamestop at 4:35 and spoke to the assistant manager about returning the game. He told me that I can only get a store credit. I showed him the receipt and explained the policy. He replied that they changed the policy at the beginning of the new year. Accordingly, the policy on my receipt is no longer valid. I tried explaining to the man that the policy on a receipt is an agreement between the buyer and seller. He repeatedly told me that it is \"always the manager's discretion to change the policy.\" He seems to misunderstand what that means. Yes, the manager can change a policy. However, a new policy does not affect purchases prior to the policy change. I told him that I will to speak to the manager tomorrow. He stated that she will say the same thing. Granted, the game is around eleven dollars but the principle is bothering me. I am going to return tomorrow to speak with the manager but I fear she'll also deny my argument. Any suggestions on what to do? \n\n\nUPDATE: Submitted feedback on site listed on receipt. District manager from Chicago contacted me about the feedback. Realized I was in Florida. Had another DM contact me. DM agreed that I was within policy rules. Told me to return to the store. I got to return the game and I was given a 10 dollar gift card. The assistant manager had to make the return and hand me the gift card. :p. All is right with the world. \nTopic:\nContracts\n","answer":" I agree with your interpretation.

My last three rent payments have been paid in full 1 to 10 days late. \n\nToday I received this email. http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wg8q57Qh.jpg\n\nI was under the impression that I could not be penalized for rent payments less than 14 days late, and that after the 14 days the landlord must go through the courts \/ landlord-tenant board for an eviction. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I respond to this?\n","answer":" That's not legal notice of termination, since it's not in one of the forms required by law. If your landlord wants to evict you for non-payment or for persistent late payment, they need to give you one of [these forms](http:\/\/www.sjto.gov.on.ca\/documents\/ltb\/Notices%20of%20Termination%20&amp;%20Instructions\/N4.pdf).\n\nConveniently, that form outlines _exactly_ what you need to do.\n\nHowever, they can give you that form the first day your rent is late, if they want. They don't have to give you 14 days before giving you notice - the date of termination has to be no earlier than 14 days from the date they _do_ give you notice.\n\nPay your rent. Let your landlord know that you expect to be given notice of termination in the legally-required form next time. Stop paying rent late unless you want to be evicted: persistently-late rent can be cause to terminate, once your lease expires."}
{"question":"My fiance came down to CT form NH for a a couple nights. Last night while with her in the hotel bed, my hand was cut pretty bad by what I found to be a pin needle looking thing sticking straight up out of the mattress. It was like one of those needles used to keep dress shirts together in the package. There was a decent amount of blood and I took pictures of the bloody bed and my hand with the needle. My fiance was scared to lay back down so she inspected the bed more. She found a small NAIL sticking straight up out of the mattress right by where the needle was. It almost looked like they where placed there intentionally to hurt someone. \n\nIt was around midnight and I called down to the front desk and asked when the manager would be in. The font desk clerk apologized when I told him what happened and said for me to come down in the morning. This morning I went to the front desk with the needle and nail in one of those plastic hotel cups. The manager said he was sorry and said \"maybe\" they would give me a discount the next time I came to stay. Meanwhile, the cut going all the way across the palm of my hand and up my thumb is throbbing and inflamed. This is a major 3 star hotel chain, FYI. \nWhat can I do?\n\nEdit: spelling\n","answer":" Some Neosporin and a bandaid would probably help.Answer #2: Post a truthful yelp reviewAnswer #3: Did you make an incident report with the hotel?  They will have procedures for recording accidents with injuries of any sort.  This would have made a record if future problems took place.  \n\nThe should pay for any medical expenses and should really have comped the room for you when they saw the injury.\n\nI'd write a complaint letter to the national office and the local hotel.   \nYou can also post a comment on review sites.  Yelp, Tripadvisor, Hotels.com, etc.\n\nUnless you have some real monetary damages there isn't much more you can do. Answer #4: You can keep nagging and probably get a refund or a free stay for another time. \n\nWhat exactly do you think you are entitled to here? \n\nIf you had medical expenses, you could probably get them covered, but it doesn't sound like you do. Answer #5: You should get a lawyer in the area and then sue the hotel chain for kajillion bajillion dollars."}
{"question":"What the title says. My stepdad and mom went to a clothing store on Sunday (fathers day) and my stepmom set her phone down for a minute when she realized she didnt have it, it was already gone. They called it, but it was turned off. But they managed to get in to her Cashapp and send themselves $200. My stepmom and dad arent very tech savvy or up to date with technology so didnt think about how they could find this person. \n\nSo I went over today and had my stepmom sign in to her cashapp account from her new phone. Turns out they tried to send themselves $600 first but she didnt have that much in her account so they settled for $200. \n\nAnyways the email that it was sent to was right there. So I wrote it down, typed it in to Facebook, and up pops the person we think it is. Here's the thing. The email has this persons first name in it and it's very uncommon spelling, the profile definitely matches up. \n\nNow my first instinct was to message this person and let her know about the incident that happened, that we linked the email to her and that police will be called. I was hoping maybe she would maybe offer to pay the money? But most of it is pure curiosity for what she has to say for herself. But that's probably a bad idea bc she might just remove her whole profile. Her profile says where she works, and other social media account information. \n\nI guess my question is, is this enough for the police to take action? The email linking to the Facebook, is it enough? I had a plan that maybe I can message her, and somehow get her to give me her email address. And if it's the email linked to the cashapp then theres absolutely no way she can deny it's hers at that point. But I'm guessing my best bet is to not contact her at all? \n\nAny suggestions?\n","answer":" Call the cops. You have all the info. DO NOT contact this person first.Answer #2: Definitely don’t contact her until you take legal action, just to be safe. People don’t usually return what they’ve stolen when asked politely.Answer #3: I would also like to suggest that you, if you haven't already, screenshot her profile and any critical information that may be deleted later on once she realizes how she was found out.\n\nThe reason being if the cops can't get enough evidence, or they don't believe there is enough, they won't send chargers to the local AG. At which point the only option is to sue her in small claims were the burden of proof is a lesser amount then criminal charges.\n\nAlso does your stepmother's stolen phone have any GPS location finder like Apple phone finder or Google timeline? Having this information would greatly help any case against her if the last turned on location was that person's house or place of work."}
{"question":"My roommate and i are both on the lease for our two bedroom apartment. I had a friend visit me for the week and since i leave for work around 730am, i told my friend they could sleep in and leave when they feel like it (mind you they were only in my room and weren't in any common areas of the apartment.) My roommate got really mad about this and told me she didn't want any of my guest in the apartment when i wasn't there. so my question is, does she have any legal right to kick guests out my room if i give them permission to be there? say for instance, if she calls the cops saying there is an intruder in the apartment, could my guest get arrested? I'm having guests stay with me soon and i am planning on them staying there while i'm not home and i would like to know if there might be any legal repercussions for this. Also, as far as i know there is nothing in my lease against doing this. I'm in California BTW\n","answer":" Your guest needs to leave when you leave. Your roommate absolutely doesn't have to deal with a stranger when you're not home. It's an unwritten rule of being a good roommate. Answer #2: &gt;  does she have any legal right to kick guests out my room if i give them permission to be there?\n\nUnless your lease has some very unusual rules about guest occupancy, the not.  You both have a right to the apartment if you're both on the lease.  \n\n&gt;  if she calls the cops saying there is an intruder in the apartment, could my guest get arrested?\n\nLegally, they aren't an intruder or trespasser.  But the cops won't know that if nobody is there saying otherwise, so it's not impossible that the police would ask them to leave.  It seems very unlikely they'd be arrested, but again, it's not completely impossible that it would happen because nobody is there in the moment to clear things up."}
{"question":"I have a 13 year old daughter who recently got into a text spat with another girl in school. Both kids were in the wrong for what they said and how they said it. I am currently taking away privileges and all that fun parent stuff.\n\nI received a phone call from the school about it today. None of this happened at school, or with school issued property  so they school just wanted to let us know that the other girl's mother called to complain. She said that if it continues they will contact the local authorities.\n\nIs that even a thing? I know full well that my child was being an asshole, but is it some sheriff worthy stuff?\n\nMy kid is terrified right now because she is convinced her life is over. She is a straight A student and is never in any trouble. She damn near shitting her pants.\n\nWe are blocking this other girl on all social media and she isn't allowed to speak to her at school (which really isn't that big of a deal).\n\nShould I keep the messages that were sent earlier in case something happens? I have a feeling that the other kid is only telling one side (my kid showed me all the messages yesterday and I already knew before the school called) and I'm worried my daughter will get railroaded or some shit.\n\nThanks! \n","answer":" Harassment is a thing, as are threats. No one knows what what was said. The only advice would be to print off text logs and keep them for your records. Answer #2: There are a variety of ways that people texting each other *could* be worthy of police involvement or even charged as a crime. \n\nWhether or not this situation rises to that level is a question we can't answer.  Certainly if your daughter is contacted by the police you should have her politely decline to answer their questions and consult an attorney.  \n"}
{"question":"5 years ago, I met someone online in an online community about music and art. He was 17 at the time. I was 28. We started out as friends talking only online. 2 years later, him 19 and me 30, we met at an art event and we hit it off. \nLast year, we started a relationship. \nHe's 22, I'm 33. \nI understand that our relationship is not conventional but we are happy. But his parents does not approve and threaten me. \nTelling me that what I'm doing is illegal. Calling me a psychopath and other very mean things, calling me a creep and telling me I should date someone my age. My boyfriend is on my side. He doesn't like the way his parents are treating me. \n\nSo, is my relationship an illegal one? \n\nThank you. \n","answer":" You're both adults.  Bang away my friend, bang away.Answer #2: having a relationship with a minor is not illegal.  it's illegal to have sex with them while they are a minor.  so if you never had sex when he was 17, there's nothing to worry about.  Answer #3: You're both adults, so it's legal.Answer #4: Since he is not a minor, as long as he is not developmentally disabled, there is likely no legal barrier to your relationship. \n\nEven going by the \"Half your age plus seven\" rule of thumb, you're only one year off. So I don't think it's nearly as creepy as his parents are making it out to be. Assuming that you are a man, I'd wager to say that the idea that their son is gay is still fresh, and that's playing a lot into their attitude. If you're a woman, then disregard - it just means they're putting their nose where it doesn't belong (which is true in the other situation too). "}
{"question":"Long story short, my friend had a party that I helped him keep under control, and the cops ended up at his house. It was just me and him at this point, but we still had some things to deal with.\n\n\nFirst of all, my friend (17) got hit with a ticket for underage drinking due to cans of beer strewn across the deck, no summons. I (18) took the fall for a dime bag of marijuana that somebody had left, because Connecticut is a decriminalized state, and anybody over the age of 18 just gets a ticket. \n\nNow, I had no issue doing this, and I would do it again in order to keep my friends record clean, since if they pinned it on him he would have a summons.\n\nThe responding officer said my license WOULD NOT get suspended. He said it was just the ticket and that's it. \n\nSo I paid the ticket...\n\nNow its looking like my license will not only be suspended, but my car insurance will go up as well.\n\nThis really isn't fair, it wasn't really my weed. My friend knows that, my parents know that, and even the responding officers acknowledged that.\n\nSo what should I do?\n","answer":" The fact that it didn't belong to you doesn't matter, see [here](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Constructive_possession).\n\nThe suspension of the license is likely administrative by whatever your DMV is called.  The police have no control over that.  Even if they do, police can lie to you.\n\n&gt;So what should I do?\n\nYou can hire a lawyer if you want.

{"question":"For this past 3-4 months, I have developed a pretty severe opioid addiction. I feel I should point out that what I have been taking is not actually illegal in the US or California. It is a heavily concentrated extract of a plant kratom and I have been buying it online and getting it mailed to me. I am addicted nonetheless and get severe withdrawal(can barely get out of bed, cannot eat anything, throw up, the works) when I don't take it. I have remained completely functional throughout this time and have not let it affect my job performance at all. \n\nI reached my wits end with my addiction yesterday and scheduled an appointment with an addiction psychiatrist tomorrow afternoon. The thing is I graduated from college last Fall was able to get my dream job working for one of the biggest biotech companies in the world. I could not ask for a better first job out of college and I am exactly where I want to be in terms of my career. Is it possible for the fact that I am seeing an addiction psychiatrist to make it back to my employer in any form? Could it affect my career in the future? In what ways? \n\nUsing my weak google skills, it looks like California has some pretty strict medical confidentiality laws but I know very little about law. \nTopic:\nHealthcare Law including HIPAA\n","answer":" This is definitely something you can ask the psychiatrist about tomorrow. One of the things they should go over with you during your initial paperwork is the limits of confidentiality and what they can and can't report, and to whom, and how they protect your privacy with your insurance\/HR\/etc. But your insurance claims, by themselves, shouldn't in any way be making it back to your employer.\n\nIf you end up needing to take time off work, you're totally fine being vague about the reason (you might want to decide on some wording about, \"It's medical, and I'd rather not get into it. It isn't serious, but has the potential to become so, so I wanted to get it taken care of now.\"). A decent manager will have the discretion and good manners to not inquire further. People have all kinds of chronic medical conditions that require care that makes them take time off work sometimes.\n\nFinally, good for you for making the call, and best of luck. I think that whatever your concerns about your employer finding out, your chances were much worse if you didn't make the call, and your addiction got worse, and started noticeably impacting your work. That's a hole that a lot of people can't dig themselves out of. That you called a pro and are getting help and taking steps to figure this out reflects well on you, and hopefully, even if your employer finds out, they'll take that into account."}

Since you reported this to the DEA and they have started an investigation, the only things they may need from you is a statement or some evidence of the prescription.  After reporting stuff to any enforcement figure, it tends to be taken out of your hands and becomes a case between \"The Doctor vs. The DEA.\"  \n\n\nAs for secrecy of what info you're being given, the DEA also has to be cognizant of the doctor's rights and that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. They can't go around telling you everything they have if the doctor ends up being innocent.  \n\n\nYou most likely won't need a lawyer since you simply reported it and were not involved in the incident."}
{"question":"Back in March, I was driving my dad's car since he's out of state. I usually park it on the street since our drive way is small. I hadn't realized, but a snow emergency was declared, and so an hour after it was declared I received the citation, which I found the next morning. I called the court to ask what my options were, and I chose to appear in court for pre-trial rather than pay the fee (Which was over $100). My dad is listed as the defendant, so I'm going to be representing him.

{"question":"So, my wife and I are expecting. The baby is due in a few months. She works full-time at a nonprofit for about 2 years now, and has disability insurance through them.\n\nShe plans to switch to working part-time with the organization after the birth. Her boss is on board with it and wants to keep her on, so wants to move her to part-time shortly before the birth and hire a second part-timer to pick up the slack. My wife was amenable to this arrangement because she doesn't want to leave her employer in the lurch while she's out for a couple of months. She hasn't done it yet, but likely will in the next month or so.\n\nThe problem is, HR is now telling my wife that if she changes to part-time status before going on FMLA, she will lose both disability insurance and FMLA, which is obviously a pretty big deal.\n\nSo my question is, can they deny her the benefits of disability insurance immediately before she actually needs it, on the basis of a change in employment status that is brought about by the disabling condition (pregnancy)? My understanding is that pregnancy is treated legally as a disabling condition for most purposes. It seems shady to me to deny someone disability insurance based on their inability to work due to that disability, but I don't even know where to go to find this kind of information...\n","answer":" If it's conditional of full-time employment, yes. My employer doesn't offer any insurance to anyone who works part time.Answer #2: To be eligible for fmla, she needs to have worked there for at least 12 months, worked at least 1,250 hours in the last 12 months, and not used 12 weeks of fmla in the last 12 months.

Whether this is prohibited discrimination depends on the exact nature of the event. For example, private clubs are allowed to discriminate based on sex so if this is a student organized event it may be legal (although it might violate school policy if conducted on campus). If it’s a school-organized event it probably isn’t legal, assuming the school is otherwise coed, but there are exceptions.\n\nIf the school doesn’t accept federal funds then Title IX doesn’t apply and the school can legally discriminate against students based on sex."}

{"question":"So I went for an interview the other day and when I arrived the office seemed a little sketchy. It was for a financial advisor position. I went inside and the employer locked the door behind me which made me feel a little uncomfortable. He started by asking me how old I am, what religion I am and started telling me how he is divorced and how young his ex wife is.\n\nHe then said \"I'm not trying to hit on you but you are a very attractive girl\" and said how that's a great \"asset\" for the job. He asked me where I went to high school and if I'm married or have kids. He made me feel uncomfortable so I didn't want to say no to him asking me to go to a meeting tomorrow to meet other employees.\n\nI informed him this morning that I am going to pass on the opportunity and he said \"I gave you the chance to say no yesterday so this wouldn't happen. Just come and I'll buy you lunch\". I then declined and he said something along the lines of \"good luck with whatever you do\". I've never dealt with this before but should I just leave it or do something about it? Thanks. \n","answer":" Where are you located? How many people would you say worked for this employer? Is it a part of some national outfit like Edward Jones or Merrill Lynch (you don't have to say the name)?\n\nI think this quite likely does constitute sexual harassment during an interview; whether it meets the \"severe or pervasive\" standard is another question, but I wouldn't swear it doesn't. What you can do about it will depend.  If it's a business too small to be covered by Title IX (some financial advisors are really small shops), it depends on whether you're in a state or municipality that extends the protections.\n\nYour options for taking legal action will therefore vary from filing a complaint with the EEOC to filing a complaint with your relevant state\/city agency (DOL or Human Rights Commission).  Additionally, if it's a small branch of a larger brand, you could consider notifying corporate; financial advisors are basically sales positions, and they really don't want somebody working for them who makes women uneasy about being there.Answer #2: Several of the questions asked are illegal because the information can be used to discriminate against protected classes.

{"question":"I have attempted to pass the bar exam on 3 separate occasion and failed in all of them due to a combination of ADHD that prevents me from adequately focusing and a heart condition that prevents me from safely using the medicine.

{"question":"I applied for a job online a little while ago for an inconsequential administrative position at an engineering company.  They asked me for some information including a mailing address.  Without communicating besides over email they offered me the job and I accepted.  Someone claiming to be my soon to be supervisor texted me and after a short conversation asked if I could do an errand for him as he wasn't in town.  He told me he'd overnighted an envelope to me and he wanted me to make purchases for the new office.  He asked me to confirm I received the package.  I was extremely suspicious of this, thinking someone might've sent me drugs or something, and called the police.  An officer was sent over and we opened the package together.  Inside were two checks for a few thousand dollars total made out to me.  The officer seemed nonplussed and left.  I haven't contacted the person over text again but said I'd do so to confirm I got the package after work, which it now is.  I'm not really sure what to make out of this.\n","answer":" &gt;The officer seemed nonplussed and left\n\nThe officers in my department would have realized what that was, immediately, and turned the checks over to a fraud detective.Answer #2: It's a scam, don't cash those checks."}
{"question":"A few weeks ago my drunk landlord, angered by music at 9:30 am tried to kick my bedroom door in and then when I confronted her she punched me in the nose. I pepper sprayed her. The police came and questioned all of us, they arrested her.\n\nI went to the doctor and got xrayed for \"nasal trauma\" my nose was not broken but bloodied and painful.\n\nTwo days later she has an eviction notice and a bogus restraining order so i can't return home. \n\nThey intend to keep all my rent for this month, and my security.

What kind of lawyer do I need to represent me at the hearing? To sue for my still sore \"nasal trauma\" which I can't ice?\n\n","answer":" What is the stated cause for eviction, and what is the stated justification for the restraining order?\n\nStart keeping a running tally of any expenses you incur as a result of your landlord's actions, and definitely keep all receipts. You may be about to sue for reimbursement later.\n\nRegarding finding a lawyer, there is probably an organization in your area that advocates for tenant rights (and possibly that provides legal aid). Do a search for \"tenants union\" or \"tenants legal aid\" in your area.\nAnswer #2: The cops arrested the landlord, so she's presumably been charged with assault. Do you have medical bills for the nose that need to be paid?"}

{"question":"Relevant law: VRALTA. \n\nRoommate moved in less than two weeks ago &amp; started 'borrowing' stuff immediately. It was mostly small household items so we didn't escalate to a police report; we just asked her to move out. (We confronted her on video about the items--we have footage of her admitting to 'borrowing' them).\n\nWell today she moved out, and we realized that she stole at least one major piece of furniture--a massive floor to ceiling mirror. I'm not even sure how she got it out the door by herself. Knowing her, she probably took some other smaller things too but we're still taking stock. In Virginia, the threshold for felony theft is $200. The mirror was definitely worth that much at one point (retail price), but I'm not sure how prosecutors value items (do they take depreciation into account?).\n\nWe filed a police report for stolen property, but the PD told us that a theft report has no bearing on tenancy. \n\nTechnically she still lives here--she paid through the end of the month (all parties agreed to prorate her rent for the end of the month, but we haven't seen her today so the transfer of funds hasn't happened yet). Most of her stuff is still here too, including her purse, bed, and boxes and boxes of personal items. **We assume she is coming back to get the rest of her stuff and potentially steal more items.**\n\n*Changing the locks is technically an illegal eviction.* Do we have any recourse other than to let the legal system play out?

{"question":"A former \"friend\" came to me shortly after I received a very very large windfall, and borrowed $21,000.  First he needed $12k to pay his contractors for his consulting biz, shortly after, he needed $9k to get out of some tax trouble and save his home.  \n\nI'm an idiot.  A blithering moron.  A hopeless simpleton.  Save it...I'm aware.  Just thought I could trust the guy.  Said he'd pay me back with interest.\n\nHe wrote me two bad checks...I did deposit one, which bounced.  Even the $200 interest check he wrote bounced.  He clearly had nothing in this account.  So he defrauded me  for $21,000.  Found out later from a mutual friend that he had a gambling problem.  Fucking awesome, right?  Shortly after this, the guy drops off the map, and stops responding to messages.\n\nI've made a point of tracking him down, and I know where he works, so I think I could have him served.

Again, I know I'm an idiot...Don't worry, I don't trust anyone anymore, and now I'm a bitter cynical asshole.  But do I have any hope of recovering this money?  Attaching his assets?  Anything?\n","answer":" &gt; My question is, is this a case any lawyer in his right mind would take on contingency?\n\nProbably not.  Your chances of recovery are slim; if he doesn't have money, he doesn't have money.

You may or may not be eligible, and the judge isn't required to award.  But you can ask.Answer #2: Yes, you can sue him.\n\nAnd in a lot of places, writing a bad check (and then failing to make good on it) is a crime for which he can be prosecuted if you report it to the police.\n\nThe problem comes down to this.

I checked my email and it was sent at 10 pm the night before that they would be replacing the doors on Thursday, not Wednesday when they came.  This is not a simple door replacement - they actually cut the whole set of double doors out of the exterior wall.  It took about 4 hours for them to finish.  There was dust everywhere and it was very hard to breathe.  They did not clean up the dust.  I had to wear a mask to vacuum up the mess. And to top it all off when they left, they left the door OPEN.  Not just unlocked, actually ajar.  I didn't notice until a couple of hours afterwards and my AC was running constantly but the apartment was getting hotter.

But I don't want to go to court.\n\nI offered the landlord a deal where I move into a new place on Feb 1st, guaranteed, and I offered a statement as well as a statement from my future landlord guaranteeing that I will leave and that I won't fight an eviction if I fail to leave.\n\nThe landlord wants me to give him those statements, and not the money, and he agrees not to take me to court.

{"question":"This happened in the city of Houston, TX.\nI appealed the ticket and the judgement was that I still have to pay the ticket. I feel that I didn't get a fair hearing (all done online) and want to appeal the hearing.\nAt this point it costs $15 to process the appeal of a judgement in a $30 parking ticket. So no matter what, even if the decision is overturned, I will have to pay a penalty. This doesn't seem right and I want to stand up to it. Can't the city just go around writing tickets to people who don't deserve them and collect even if the accused motorist is innocent? I don't feel like this is right and I want to do something about it.\nHowever, do I have ground to stand on? Are they doing something crooked?

If a police officer feels you are illegally parked, they have every right to write you a ticket.  If YOU feel that you did NOT commit the infraction, you can make your case at your hearing.  The court then decides whether you did or did not commit a parking infraction.  \n\nThe court decided you did.  Therefore, you \"deserve\" this ticket.

{"question":"I got pulled over and issued a citation back in November (I ran a red light). Before my court date, I hired a lawyer here in the Houston area. He was a solo practitioner. Since the beginning there has been very little communication between the law office and me, no phone calls, emails or updates. In January, I appeared for my court date and no one from the law office showed up. My date was reset. I was upset because I had to take the day off work and was hoping I could resolve my ticket on this date. So, I called the office and they informed me that the lawyer had passed away and now they were handing off cases to temporary attorneys. Ok, no problem, it was unfortunate but I understood. However, there was NO communication after this, my phone calls and messages were ignored, emails never returned. When Covid-19 shut down the courts, the lawyers were tasked with resetting court dates after reopening. The law office did not do this, so I have been calling them every day because the deadline to reset is tomorrow, May 29. Today when I called the office for an update, the paralegal (?) told me that since I had paid money to the lawyer who had passed, his obligation to me and my case had ended. They would not be reimbursing me and they wanted me to stop calling. \nIs this legal?? It doesn’t feel right. Especially since after he passed they told me they were handling open cases with temporary attorneys. It wasn’t a lot of money, but still, it’s the principal. What can I do? Please advise!\n","answer":" You say he was a solo practitioner so I'm guessing the office you mention calling consists only of support staff, no lawyers.\n\nThe support staff can't represent you - they're not licensed to practice law.\n\nIn theory the support staff could try to outsource the work to lawyers at other firms.  But it generally costs more to switch lawyers because the new lawyer has to look at the case from scratch and there is duplication of effort.  Consequently the solo practitioner's business likely does not have enough money to hire lawyers to represent all of its existing clients.\n\nYou can try to get your money back in small claims court by suing the legal entity to whom you wrote the check (e.g. if the solo practitioner created a business entity) or the solo practitioner's estate if he conduced business as an individual.  Might be more trouble than it's worth though.Answer #2: If the law office is unwilling to help you *and* refuses to refund then I would contact: \n[Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel](https:\/\/www.texasbar.com\/AM\/Template.cfm?Section=Grievance_and_Ethics_Information1&amp;Template=\/CM\/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=23824) for Texas and file a grievance.  If you’re going to keep fighting the case you will end up needing to find another attorney. But I doubt the original law firm will cave in and help based on your interaction with them thus far.\n\nAlso it’s possible based on the circumstances you can reach out to the [Client Security Fund](https:\/\/www.texasbar.com\/AM\/Template.cfm?Section=Free_Legal_Information2&amp;Template=\/CM\/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=34079) and get a refund there. This is again if the law firm refuses to reimburse then go this route and see if anything pans out.Answer #3: Step 1.  Call the court and explain the situation.  Ask if you can get a continuance.

First, I live and work in Pennsylvania. \n\nA few weeks ago my boss learned I accepted another job (one day a week) I didn't break any company rules but they decided to lay me off and attempt to keep things civil. About a year ago, they purchased a 'kit' for me to use. This kit was comprised of various grooming tools. All of the items (the ones that didn't break or weren't used up) remain at my job. However, my boss is refusing to return the items I've purchased in my own. I've provided receipts proving the items were bought and paid for by me, but she's hidden my personal belongings in her home (I learned this from a few ex-coworkers) she is insisting that she has a right to keep my things until she receives money for the kit items (mind you, I had no idea I was responsible for this kit- never signed any paperwork about company items- and it's kept in an unlocked room that's frequently been broken into).

{"question":"I moved into an apartment 2 months ago and the hot water doesnt work. Per my lease it says all maintenance issues need to be requested in writing, and I email them every week about the issue but it gets ignored. Two weeks ago they had a plumber come by and installed a new thermostat on the heater and it fixed the issue temporarily ( 3 days ). I pay $1200 a month at this place and I'm under the impression that hot water being out makes the unit uninhabitable. I guess I'm going to get a new heater installed myself - and deduct it from rent. Is there anything I can do about the 2400 in rent I've paid already in an 'uninhabitable' apartment?   \n","answer":" From a brief google search, the LL has 7 days after written notice from you to fix the problem. If the LL does, then you can start witholding rent.

{"question":"Wife and I were renting a condo from some landlords back in 2009 (we moved out at the end of 2009).\n\nWhile we lived there, there was a leak coming from the shower that was going through to the ceiling below.\n\nWe contacted the landlords who called a plumber.\n\nThe landlords stiffed (did not pay) the plumber on the $155 service fee (date of service was 5\/14\/2009).\n\nA collection agency contacted us recently (date of letter was 11\/3\/2016), saying we owe'd the $155 to the plumber.\n\nWe had never received a statement prior to this collection letter.\n\nMy wife faxed the collection agency a letter that said we were not the property owners, we didn't enlist the plumbers services, and were not responsible for the debt.\n\nWe sent them the last known contact information for the landlords.\n\nThe collection agency responded by mailing us a copy of the original invoice that has my wife's name on it.\n\nWe think that my wife may have signed a form for the plumber after he finished, but we're not sure.  If she did, we think it's unlikely that they still have that signed document if it took them 7.5 years to send us to collections.\n\nWhat are our options?\n\nAre we legally responsible to pay this debt on behalf of the landlord?\n\nOur credit is excellent, and will be purchasing a house soon, so we don't want to mess it up over $155.  At the same time, it's not our debt and we don't want to pay it.\n\nWhat should we do?\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" Statute of limitations on debt in Ohio is 6 years.

However, my phone died and the alarm didn't go off so I got a parking ticket. I probably won't ever be back at VT, do I necessarily need to pay the ticket?\n","answer":" VT and U.Va. are pretty good at getting the DMV involved.

{"question":"I am renewing my Captains license and one of the requirements is passing a drug test.  I went in for a test at Labcorp on Dec. 12 and was told that my results would be returned within 3 days.  Five days later I still had not received my results.  I was told to follow up directly with the lab they had sent my sample to.  When I called the lab to which I was referred, I received an answering machine stating that my call will be returned within 24 hours.  No returned call, even after multiple voicemails left over a week long period.  Called Labcorp again today only to be told that they had lost my sample and I would need to come in for a retest.

They should have the results by the 2nd.Answer #2: Contact Labcorp for a higher up supervisor and expedite if you can. However, within a weekend, you might be limited. Can you contact the Coast Guard and ask them which protocol you need to follow? Answer #3: I promise you this has happened before and it's probably not all that bleak. So first things first- contact the Regional Exam Center in Honolulu  at (808)-522-8274.\n\nThey might redirect you to someone else at either the National Maritime Center or somewhere else. There may be a waiver process if it is that dire. \n\nPersonally, I doubt it is. I'm guessing when you first got your license you took a local course like Boatwise. Those are not requirements at the Federal level. The CG allows those to be taken in lieu of the CG exam. All other requirements are the same, which means you have the hours required to take the exam if your license truly does lapse.\n\nNow, I may be wrong about some of this due to state regulations and not knowing what class of masters license you have\/need, but no matter what, your first call should be to the REC."}

{"question":"My daughter got a concussion in March at a school sanctioned sporting event. It was not her first one. She is under the care of a neurologist who has given her a 504 guide for school that includes walking only during PE. She is on a signed 504 plan at school. My daughters PE teacher has told her repeatedly that concussions don't last this long and that she needs to participate.  My daughter has the note from the doctor, which she has shown her but it makes no difference.  She tries to shame her in front of the whole class to get her to participate. The school counselor has sent and email to this woman to tell her to stop and follow the guidelines but it makes no difference.  \n\nMy kid has bad migraines now, light sensitivity, dizziness,  confusion and nausea. Basically she has post concussion syndrome. This PE teacher is making it so much worse for her by continually harassing her and getting away with it because the schools not enforcing it. Who or what can I do to escalate this and make her stop? I'm in California.\nTopic:\nSchool Related Issues\n","answer":" Is your daughter old enough that she can stand her ground and say \"no?\" If so, that's step one. If not, it might be worth pulling her out of the class entirely - it sounds like the office is on board with the 504 plan, and they should be able to help you make alternate arrangements, such as library time, without impacting her grades for the year.\n\nIf the school is unwilling to stick to the 504 plan, escalate to the principal. If that doesn't produce immediate results, go to your school superintendent. If the school board doesn't bring them into line, speak to an education attorney about taking them to court.\n\nSeparately, it is _very_ unusual for students to receive multiple concussions. It might be worth a conversation with an attorney anyways, just to look into whether the school's sports and physical education program is operating unsafely."}

Three of her videos are very popular among our members and we have quoted $100,000 per video for those. We also quoted $20,000 for the unreleased videos. So overall it was $710,000. We gave her a discount and called it $700,000. Also, the contract would allow us to continue using the material for a further 12 months. This is to give us time to produce replacement content.

{"question":"We are anticipating snow and ice here in Georgia today and tomorrow. I have a family member who works for a private hospital system. Her shift starts tomorrow morning, and the inclement weather is supposed to start sometime overnight. Her manager is forcing them to come in 13 hours early to ensure that she doesn't miss work tomorrow. During this time they are expected to sleep on cots in hallways or empty rooms if some are available. They are not paid at all (not even a reduced rate) until their shift starts 13 hours later.\n\nMy question: Is this legal?

That includes hours that they are \"engaged to wait\", which is what's happening here.

This would be no different than if the hospital had a meeting and said they all must attend, then the speaker didn't show up. They would still get paid.\n\nYour friend should say they expect to get paid and then point out if they don't, they'll file a wage claim and get the hours and once the claim is filed it may trigger a wage audit.

{"question":"Starting from the beginning, my parents own a business as well as the property the business is on. A man was parked in the parking lot and was littering (throwing cigarette butts and spilling his drink). My mother went out and told him not to and he responded with “go fuck your self, this is America, I can do whatever I want.” My mom went back inside to tell the wife of the man that he needs to leave. My father overheard what happened and went to out to the parking lot. He knocked on his window and told him he needs to leave. The guy swung open his car door, which knocked down my dad. He got up and was then punched in the face by this guy. There were multiple witnesses including me, customers, employees, and even a fire fighter who was jogging by. The police were then called and took statements. Not once did the cop ask my dad if he wanted to press charges. He said to let it go and if the man comes back to call the police. After recovering from the shock of what had just happened we called the police again to file a report. The same cop came and said that we should think of it from the other persons point of view, that someone knocking on your window could be threatening enough for you to punch them. He also said the cops have bigger problems to deal with, but it’s ridiculous that someone could get away with that so we filed the report and now are waiting for a detective to contact us. \n\nMy question is what should we be doing at this point to make sure that we have a strong case?\n","answer":" You get that cops name and badge number and have a chat with his supervisor. That's total bullshit. Knocking on a window isn't a threatening gesture to warrant punching someone.\n\n\nIdeally you want the name and contact info for all of those witnesses.

{"question":"John Oliver appears to be named on much of the paperwork for the non-profit organization, but by having an actress appear as a fictitious wife, could this not be an instance of fraud\/deception that would undermine the otherwise carefully planned legitimacy of the organization?\n","answer":" a) It's a satire.  The whole point is to be absurd.

Mostly because I think my parents lied to me about some of the aspects of the case when I asked them about it recently, but also I feel like it would help me get some semblance of closure. Is it at all possible for me to view a sealed court case as the victim or am I just out of luck?\n","answer":" What aspects of the case are you interested in knowing about?\n\nYou might find a more detailed account in the police report, which would be far easier to obtain a copy of. If the case was a plea bargain or nollo contendre, you might request a transcript or court record that has nothing specific in it at all. \n\nSince it sounds like the suspect was technically a juvenile at the time of the offense, his case was likely handled by juvenile court.

She says we talked about not needing a police report as no one was injured, but later says her neck was hurting. The police report also claims she needed surgery on her neck. \n\nNow, the only reason this woman got my information is that the next day, one of her friends saw my car and said that was the one who hit her. They took a picture of my license plate, university parking tag, and damage on my front bumper that's been there since I bought it in 2015. \n\nShe also states this happened around 6:00 PM, and I have my time sheet from work stating I was at work until 6:00 PM on October 3rd.\n\nThis has just been a stressful situation for me and even though I know she has no solid evidence and know I did not do it, it still has been a lot to deal with on top of college.

{"question":"Say you have a judgement for $10,000 against a bank or something. Could you go through and take all the fire extinguishers so they have to close down for safety reasons?\n\nIt's pretty niche, so I doubt many people are ever going to need to know, but I wondered whether there are rules on what you should reposess before you start taking items that are critical to keeping a business\/house safe and open.\n","answer":" Yes, in general the sheriff can help you repossess assets of the business, which will be sold at auction to pay off the judgment.\n\nBut the sheriff is not stupid.  The fire extinguishers are going to sell for $10, despite their original cost being much higher.  The sheriff is going to concentrate on cash and other things that convert easily into cash.\n\nSame deal with the IRS.  They can take anything to pay off your tax debt.  But they'll concentrate on bank accounts and yachts and gold bullion, not old pairs of gym socks.\n\nIt's not punitive.  You can't use it as a weapon to inflict extra injury.

{"question":"My husband and i live in a different state from his ex-wife and their kids.  My husband flies there to have his parenting time every 1st, 3rd, and 5th weekend without fail.  He took a job (and a substantial pay cut) specifically to make this possible.\n\nWe have the kids fly to us for long breaks or special events.  In two years, this has been a total of 5 times.  The kids are savvy travelers and enjoy this pretty enthusiastically.  Ex is now threatening to take us to court because having to drive them to the airport 20 minutes from their house a few times a year is just too onerous and unreasonable.  She has also told my husband several times (sometimes in writing, because she is an idiot despite being a lawyer) that she want the travel to be as unpleasant for him as possible.\n\nTheir divorce decree has specific provisions for when the parents live more than 100 miles apart.  It also specifically states that she has to take the kids to the airport at our request for ALL of our parenting time if we so chose.  Obviously we don’t want to do this for the kids’ sake.  She claims that she only agreed to this in the divorce decree because she didn’t actually think she would ever have to do it.  She states that my husband told her that he wouldn’t be moving (he didn’t, but whatever), so she shouldn’t have to be bound by the divorce decree that specifically allows for this.\n\nShe is going to take us to court to try to get this changed.  Any advice or words of wisdom?\n\nThank you!\n","answer":" &gt; Any advice or words of wisdom?\n\nMake sure your lawyer demands attorney fees for responding to a motion filed in bad faith.Answer #2: She's a lawyer. Why did she even allow that verbage in the divorce decree if she never wanted to abide by it? And if the decree outlines what happens IF anyone moves, then its regardless of whether who said they would or wouldn't do or what they actually did, the decree permits it so.... \n\nI think she's just trying to bully you two around with the threat of \"I'm a lawyer so that means I'll automatically win.\" Confer with your own lawyer. Is there anything else in the divorce decree that your husband gave up or compromised on in order to get something else? Warn (again consult with lawyer first) the ex that if she reopens the divorce decree for _this_, you'd be very interested in revisiting certain other sections of the decree."}
{"question":"In 2014 in Wisconsin, I was diagnosed with a crippling autoimmune disease. In November of that year, I started on Humira (40mg per 2 weeks), but it quickly became clear that I was experiencing a cyclical response because the standard dosage wasn't high enough. My doctor requested prior approval from my health insurance company for a doubling of the dosage frequency (Humira 40 mg every week), but my insurer denied it, insisting that I try less expensive options first. \n\nFor the next 3 years, I repeatedly tried alternative treatments, failed to experience sufficient improvement, and again appealed to my insurer for weekly Humira. For each step in each appeal, they took the longest contractually-allowed time (30 days) to issue their rejection. By the time I ran out of alternative options and they finally approved the weekly Humira in May of 2017, I was on a plethora of other medications to try to treat my symptoms, including dexamethasone, leflunomide, and gabapentin. \n\nThe problem is, even after getting the treatment that I wanted all along, I'm suffering permanent damage from the side effects of the alternative treatments I had to try in the meantime. From the dexamethasone, I've ended up with Cushing's Syndrome. From the leflunomide, I've ended up with disabling nerve damage in my legs. The gabapentin gave me dry mouth, which caused receding gums, giving me permanent, severe tooth sensitivity. Additionally, my vision was damaged by the inflammation flare-ups I experienced during the times I was required to try treatments that just didn't work at all. \n\n**TLDR: Both my doctor and I knew from the start that the safest, most effective treatment for me was weekly Humira, but my insurer insisted that I try a series of less-effective, more-dangerous treatments first, just because they were cheaper. Now I have permanent damage from this. Can I sue?**\n","answer":" No unfortunately, you decided to take the other treatments. No one forced you to. The side effects were labelled and you took the risk.\n\nI am sorry you're in this situation but you can't sue."}

{"question":"Hi everyone, please excuse the lack of formality with this post, I am new at this.\n\nI have a home in Toronto that is leased out for 2 years to a tenant. The lease started September 15, 2015. In our lease we signed a clause stating I cannot use the for N12 to move into the building. \n\nI've learned recently that he has been collecting rent from other individuals he calls his \"roommates\" but has not been paying me rent! As the landlord, I was seriously concerned. \n\nI gave him his N4 and 2 weeks later filed a form L1 and have a L1 meeting with the LTB. Today I got an email from his paralegal saying they are requesting an adjournment because their agent won't be available on that date. How is this fair? Can they do so?\n\nI've also received 4 letters from neighbours with their experience with my tenant. They say he films them from the windows, has cameras pointed at them 24\/7, swears at them, calls the police on them, leaves food scraps in the backyard to attract raccoons, and the list goes on and on. \n\nHe really is a problem tenant and I need to get rid of him. Is there anything I should be aware of going into the L1 meeting? Is there anything I can say to prevent the adjournment and have the meeting held on that date? I was thinking that since he is so aggressive and a problem tenant that the board could deny his adjournment request. \n\nI should also add he was 3 months behind for a while, but now is 2 months behind.

The tenant can drag this out for months, and if he has legal representation, you are going to need your own in order to fight back with any hope of winning.  \n\nAnd legal costs are going to be MUCH cheaper in the long run than letting this guy remain as a tenant.\n\nAlso; you should develop a relationship with a paralegal or lawyer for all future rental issues.\n"}

{"question":"Our home in Honolulu, Hawaii does not touch the street. We are “landlocked”. The private driveway leading to our property is owned by the house next door and we have an access easement over it. The language in the easement does not go into any detail. It simply identifies the property lots and says \"access easement\". The driveway is over 150 feet long and curves and slopes its way down to our properties.\n\nFor 20+ years the previous owners of the driveway used it only as a driveway to access their house. The new owner, however, is having his tenants park multiple cars along the driveway, hampering access to our house. We can just squeeze by in our medium-sized cars, especially on the curves. A delivery truck, service vehicle, or ambulance can no longer access our house which is extremely inconvenient as it's a considerable walk and it rains 140 inches a year in our valley.\n\nThe cars parked on the driveway belong to numerous different tenants and their guests, and there is no practical way to get them all to move their cars off the driveway at a particular time to schedule access.\n\n We feel we no longer have \"reasonable access\" to our property. We have spoken with the new owner of the driveway, but he claims as long as our cars can squeeze by, it's not his problem. Does anyone have advice about this?

I have no idea what to do. Thanks in advance.\n","answer":" You sue them.  [Small claims court](http:\/\/consumer.georgia.gov\/consumer-topics\/magistrate-court) is your best bet.Answer #2: In the future, you should get a Square reader and set up a Square account (both are free at squareup.com).  This allows you to take credit and debit card payments through your phone.  They'll send you a free strip reader and you can opt to purchase a chip reader, but you can also type in the numbers manually and run the card that way.

This way you don't have to accept checks and you can have the money deposited the next business day.  I am a crafter and use Square, and I love it.Answer #3: Regarding baking out of your home: are you up on all needed licenses etc.? If not you may want to check whether pursuing this is likely to open you up to fines in which case it may be cheaper to take the loss on the cake.

{"question":"I was born in North Carolina and recently moved to another state.  I have two middle names.  Let's say my full name is Smellyfinger Adam John Smith.   I sent a request for a copy of my birth cert so I can get a drivers license in my new home state.  The process was taking a long time so I called NC Vital Records to see what the holdup is.  The main holdup was a couple letters transposed in \"John\" in their electronic system that they said could be easily fixed.  However, during the conversation I mentioned that \"John\" is the second of my two middle names.  They said \"No, you have two last names: John Smith, and your mother signed the document.\"  I have not yet seen the official document, but my mom is going to send it to me (and she thinks this is all crazy since she never intended for me to have two last names).  I've lived my whole life with only one last name, and my US passport even lists only one last name. Actually, my passport only shows Smellyfinger Adam Smith.\n\nI asked what would happen if I just continued living as I have been my whole life, and she said I could try, but it could end up causing issues at some point.

{"question":"So recently my friend went to the hospital and part way into her visit, the hospital staff started acting a bit odd towards her. They call in the psychiatrist who evaluates her to determine if she's a harm to herself or anyone else. The evaluation came back positive, she wasn't a harm to anyone, herself included. Then they come back later and say they're admitting her on a psych hold.\n\nLater on, my friend is contesting it and it comes to light, in a recorded conversation, that the psychiatrist openly lied in her report saying that my friend wanted to jump in front of a car to kill herself. She then told my friend that if she wanted out, she could call the cops, they'd evaluate her, and if they deem her fit, they'll let her go. Later on, they're getting ready to discharge her from the hospital (for some unknown reason), when the cops come in.\n\n\nTurns out that the psychiatrist told her to call the cops full well knowing that the act alone would put out a warrant for her to be placed in a hold until their psychiatrist could come around, so Monday at the earliest, possibly. So that means she'd be forcibly held in a hospital since Friday until then, and that it could be next Friday even before she's discharged, forcing her to miss numerous days of work. \n\n\nTl;dr: Goes to hospital for health issue. Psychiatrist comes in and lies on report to get her admitted. Later on admits it on tape. Discharged her after telling her to call the cops, knowing they'd place her under a hold for the call. Cops placed her under hold till possibly Monday or next Friday at the latest.\n","answer":" Malpractice is beyond the scope of the sub. You’ll need to contact an attorney who specializes in this.Answer #2: What country, state, or province does your friend live in ?\n\nLet's jump to the question:   \"Can my friend quickly be released from involuntary psychiatric treatment because of misconduct by a doctor ?\"\n\nNo.   The legal and medical procedures that allow a person to be committed for treatment don't have a shortcut that overrides the judicial and medical processes because a person in authority committed misconduct.\n\nThis is especially true because claims of misconduct like the ones you describe are commonplace in psychiatric treatment holds.\n\nIs there recourse at a later date for your friend to make a claim for damages against the psychiatrist because that person fabricated statements that caused her to be confined and incur costs ?   Yes.   This could be a medical malpractice claim or a civil suit for unlawful confinement or defamation.\n\nI realize that your friend is in distress, but I encourage you to consider that her narrative may not be reliable.  Medical and law enforcement professionals either conspired on the spot to kidnap her, or they recognized her acute need for psychiatric treatment and took action.Answer #3: Sorry this isn’t a legal comment but I’d like to point out that you’re leaving out some relevant info.

{"question":"My sister lost her home in Valley Stream NY she was renting because the landlords ex husband was occupying the basement and forgot to turn off the hot plate when he left.

{"question":"So a Florida COA board is out of control. Yesterday they threw away people's doormats, saying the mats interfere with egress and ingress and are a violation of the rules. \n\nSomeone posted or shared a short video of the board member doing this. Near the end of the video she says the photographer might get slapped. When questioned whether she's threatening to do that, she says no, and says the cell phone lady is being a nuisance.\n\nWhat can be done about all this? People don't deserve to lose personal property. And certainly a lady in a common area with a cellphone shouldn't be subject to loose threats or intimidation.\n\nFYI, a Florida COA may have strange rules. But throwing away personal property? And talking about slapping people?\n\nThe board posted individual handwritten notices the day before asking condo owners to remove the doormats. Didn't give a timeline. \nDidn't say they would take your doormat to the trash. \n\nThe board tells owners these doormats are a rules violation. However, no one can actually find a rule that specifically forbids doormats. The rule mentions bicycles and furniture as examples of obstruction.\n\nAlso, being in Florida, we occasionally have older or disabled folks who could stumble on a doormat. But they could also stumble on some of the loose pavers, or on a rug in the laundry room.\n\nAnd yet another twist. This board was not elected.

{"question":"The other day me and my boyfriend got woken up by the local police department in Michigan as well as our apartment's landlord telling us that our fire alarm was going off for 3 hours. However living in an apartment it is highly unlikely, if it was going off for that long, that we didn't hear it. They told us that they thought we were dead so they came in to investigate it. But if they actually thought that, why did they take the time to get a house key from the landlord, and there wasn't a fire fighter or an EMT there. We had a generous amount of tree as well as a bong laying out in our living room which they obviously found upon entering. They took our tree and bong with them and also searched one of our bags and took our two bowls that were in our room. Then they told us that we now have pending warrants for our arrest (which you can only get if you are arrested). They didn't arrest either on of us so isn't it illegal for them to give us warrants and use evidence to search for other evidence? They didn't give us a ticket or anything they only took our phone numbers when they left. I don't understand why we weren't arrested and taken to jail or why only the police department came without the FD or an EMT if they thought we were \"dead\".

My girlfriend heard a knock at the door but didn’t answer, then heard someone enter the apartment. She thought it was my roommate but turns out it was a male and female who used keys to enter our apartment. They claimed to see if the apartment was furnished (they offer furnished apartments for a higher price which I passed on for a cheaper price) which is in our contracts. After that, they checked to see if our locks on our bedrooms worked. My GF watched them the whole time. It makes me uneasy and I’ve never had to deal with this in the past. Is there any advice or any actions I am entitled to? Please help me out guys.\n","answer":" I would set up a camera or two inside when not home and see what happens as well.  I suspect there was something very different happening than checking the furniture.Answer #2: California has decent tenant privacy laws. You can find some info by Googling \"California Landlord Tenant PDF\" (I tried to link it, but Reddit didn't like the link)\n\nIf you choose to speak with the landlord, do it in writing so you've got the paper trail incase you need to escalate the situation. Answer #3: Call your landlord and remind them to give you notice in the future."}
{"question":"Hello,\nSo when I was born my mom believed a guy named Caleb to be my dad so he was put on my birth certificate (after he signed something as well). I never met him so I knew nothing about him. But earlier this year I took a DNA test via 23andme and matched with a guy named Jacob who turned out to be my actual father. Now that I know do I have to correct my birth certificate or can I just leave it alone?\n","answer":" Depends on how old you are and what you want.  If you are a minor, practically speaking, your mom would have to do everything if you wanted a change.  And it could certainly have child support implications for your newly named father.\n\nSince you didn’t list a location, I’m speaking with generalized US advice.   For more, we need your age, location, and to know if you know who your biological dad is.\n\nMost states won’t allow the removal of a father from the birth certificate of a minor unless a new father is named, that way if you go on welfare the state has someone to go after.\n\nAs an adult, birth father really only impacts inheritance and next of kin for medical decisions.  So no need to change anything.\n\nGive us a little more info and we’ll give you some clearer answers."}

{"question":"For work I pick up product from a storage facility. They usually have one elevator working at a time and todays elevator didn't go to my floor so somebody had to take me up when I was done doing what I had to I rang the elevator and nothing. I tried every elevator on the floor and waited. There's no was to know what floors the elevators are on or if they're coming up or not. So after waiting a while I wanted to go down a floor where all elevators go to see if I can catch the working one there and I found out that they lock all the doors to staircases. All emergency exits, and there's no fire escape. If I didn't have my phone to call downstairs I'd be locked in the top floor indefinitely even worst if there was a fire in the building.

{"question":"Sorry if the flair is wrong, I wasn't sure how to label this\n\nSo a little backstory: I came out to my mom as a lesbian about 4 months ago. Ive come to deeply regret this, as she constantly insinuates that I just THINK im gay, and it just makes me uncomfortable knowing she knows. I live with my dad, while she lives across the country. For awhile now, I've been planning to move in with her, as my dad is an incredibly abusive piece of shit. He doesn't know im a lesbian, and im scared to know whats going to happen if he ever finds out (he's homophobic)\n\nNow here's why im afraid shes going to blackmail me: I don't want to move in with her anymore. We recently found out she's addicted to meth, and started drinking again. She's completely destroyed her life and isn't financially stable to afford her own place, which is why I've decided to stay with my dad. \n\nShes threatened to blackmail me with it before, and I have no doubt in my mind that she'll do it again once I tell her I dont want to move in with her anymore\n\nIs there anything I can do? I should note that im a minor, I just need to know if there's anyway I can protect myself without my dad knowing. Yall I'm seriously fucked if she tells my dad about this\n\nEdit: ok I guess it wasn't clear in the post, shes threatening to tell my homophobic abusive dad im a lesbian.\nTopic:\nOther Civil Matters\n","answer":" How is she trying to blackmail you?"}
{"question":"Hey Reddit, German law student here!\n\nI am writing a paper on the boundaries that german courts face, when they publish their decisions. In Germany these decisions are usually anonymized, to protect the identities of the people involved (f.e. Martin Brown would become M.B.).\n\nHowever, that is not the case in the US and many other jurisdictions (Brown v Baker etc.). So I wondered, what is the rationale behind stating the full names of the people involved (and not anonymising them), if there is any at all?\n","answer":" Names are typically only redacted in child custody matters or other situations where there is a risk of harm to the parties involved, such as domestic abuse cases.\n\nThe reason is that as a general rule in America we treat our court records as open public documents that anyone can access.  Unless there is a demonstrated danger or harm to publication of a name the fact that you were involved in a lawsuit isn’t in and of itself harmful and so to be as transparent as possible we keep the records fully open."}

{"question":"Asking from Dallas, Texas. After having my car damaged in an accident through no fault of my own (I was basically rear ended, but in the front by someone driving in reverse, while I was not moving at all) my apartment complex has told me that I cannot park in apartment parking until I fix the damage to my car. The damage is mostly cosmetic, and I am very busy, so I have been slow to get it fixed. I began parking on a residential street across the street from my apartment, paying attention to parking signs(No parking this side of sign, that kind of thing). This morning I found an envelope tucked under my wiper on which was written \"Please Do Not Park in our Neighborhood\". Inside was a letter which reads, \n\n\"The ***neighborhood*** has noticed you parking here + walking to apartment across the way. Not allowed here and one neighbor has reported you to ***police***. Please park somewhere else -- not ***our*** area. We pray for your safety and wish you the best.\"\n\nWhen I park in this neighborhood I am very considerate, making sure not to park in front of anyone's house; I park beside one house, close to an alley. Am I in the wrong here? I feel like if I was, the police would have actually done something when someone called to report. I have not been able to find anything saying that what I am doing is illegal. The closest I can find is a Dallas ordinance saying it is illegal to leave a car unattended on the street for more than 24 hours without moving it, but I'm not sure if that applies to residential street parking. I would think that since it is a public street, payed for by my tax dollars, and there are no signs stating otherwise, I would have the right to park there, but maybe I'm wrong.\n","answer":" Wait a sec--what's up with this?\n\n&gt; my apartment complex has told me that I cannot park in apartment parking until I fix the damage to my car.\n\nAre you guaranteed a spot in your lease? Do they have any kind of official rules about this?"}
{"question":"[deleted]\n","answer":" &gt;Do I have other options?\n\nYour options are to break the lease per the terms in said lease.  If you feel that afraid, pay the fees and move somewhere else.  Does your lease allow subleasing?  Try talking to the landlord and see if they will work something out with you.  Legally your landlord could tell you to fuck off, but use some honey and talk to the landlord like a reasonable human being.  \n\nYour landlord is generally not liable for somebody else robbing your apartment\/you.  Oklahoma has quality firearms laws.  It would behoove you to look into self defense options.\n\nYes the world is shitty.Answer #2: Really creepy is an understatement here, this is at \"25 minutes into a horror movie\" levels of creepy.  Answer #3: IANAL but I don't think this is considered a valid reason to break a lease. It wasn't necessarily the landlord's fault, and your place can get broken into anywhere."}
{"question":"I work in a restaurant, and I had a table of 6 people who said they work at a restaurant\/bar close by and each person invited me to hang out at the bar and watch football. The manager was at the table, and he said he would be bartending and I could drink for free.   One guy in particular, I’ll call him Ron, kept saying “bring your friends.” When I arrived at the bar, I was never asked to show ID. The manager poured me my drink and almost instantly after Ron poured me another. I hadn’t even taken a sip of the first drink so I said to him “what’s this for?” and he said “You said you wanted a Jameson and ginger.” Had that drink at about 4:15 and by 5:00 I blacked out. I do not remember a single thing from 5pm until 5am when I woke up with a killer headache, bruises all over my body, and a pretty deep cut on my forehead. I was with my boyfriend at the bar, he didn’t realize I was roofied he thought I had just drank a little too much. We took an Uber home around 7 and I was passed out by 8. I’m underage, 19, but I’m wondering if legal action would help. Bartenders giving roofies to customers is dangerously common in Annapolis. I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. If I hadn’t been with my boyfriend this man definitely would have raped me.  I don’t know if approaching the manager would help because if they are going out to brunch together they must be close. I don’t want any girls being raped by this man who abuses his job. Would approaching the police help? What could the police do?\n","answer":" I'm going to eat a lot of downvotes for this, but you are an underage inexperienced drinker who was getting friendly bartender pours of alcohol. The [overwhelming majority](http:\/\/freakonomics.com\/2009\/11\/24\/the-spiked-drink-myth\/) of people who [think their drink was spiked](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/uknews\/crime\/6440589\/Date-rape-drink-spiking-an-urban-legend.html) really probably just drank too much. This is not to say that it doesn't happen. It does. \n\nBuuuuut when you're getting mixed drinks poured by a friendly bartender (making it difficult to determine amount drunk) and you're an inexperienced drinker (age 19) it's very, very likely you just drank too much. The fact that you were with your boyfriend the entire time makes it that much less likely that you were roophied.Answer #2: NAL. If this just happened then you should go to the hospital and get a blood test. They should be able to see if there's something in your system, but you'd need to go within a certain time limit.\n\nDid your boyfriend tell you why you've got bruises and a cut?"}
{"question":"I’ll preface this by saying I’m not entirely sure if this belongs here, but I’m a little baffled by the whole situation and don’t know what my best course of action is. \n\nBasically my wife and I recently leased a townhouse(South Florida) that is located in a community managed by a new HOA. After waiting two weeks for the HOA to approve us(which had a shady moment on their part) they finally approved us last Friday. That night we went in and signed the lease(we have a landlord who owns the actual town house). Because we signed the lease at night we weren’t able to call the HOA until Monday morning(Today) to get our access codes for the gates into the community(a resident walking his dog let us in Friday). My wife called the HOA this morning as soon as they opened(9am) to get our access codes and was told that they would call us later in the day to set up our codes.\n\n By 3pm my wife hadn’t heard anything so she called back and was told “You’re going to have to give us some time because we’re having trouble with the system” when my wife asked what she should do tomorrow(Tuesday) because we have a furniture delivery and the city is coming to turn on power\/water she was told “I don’t know what you can do”. At this point we reached out to our landlord and realtor who pretty much got the same response. What is our best course of action? I’m afraid of pushing too hard because I know HOA’s can come down hard on you if you piss them off.  The HOA isn’t even located on premise although several of their board members are.\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" Call your landlord and request their code.

{"question":"I work in ad sales. A few months ago I sold several ads to a client, invoiced them, and they never paid. Now my boss is telling me I'm responsible. At first I thought he meant repaying comission I earned, but then he clarified that I am actually responsible for repaying the full sale price of their ads (~$5k total), and that we will discuss a \"plan for me to pay it off\" on Monday.\n\nIs that legal?\n","answer":" No. That is not at all legal. The client is responsible for the incursion of any and all debt as a result of services provided at their request. The \"plan\" your boss should have should be for him to contact the company attorney to discuss a lawsuit or other legal actions against the client."}

{"question":"[deleted]\n","answer":" &gt; Can the department be sued for failing to pursue attack 1, by either v1 or v2?\n\nNo.  First, because the police have absolute authority to decide whether to file charges - and frankly, your evidence of it being deliberate versus accidental is kind of weak.  Second, you draw no connection between the incidents.  You have different victims between 1 and 2, and no evidence that the person in 1 is in any way connected to 2 or 3.  Especially because of the great length between incidents."}

{"question":"I have a friend who is being forced by the company we both work for to work from home.  We work for a call center in the state of MO than handles several different clients. I am part of workforce management for the company and she works for our client services department. We have call centers all over the world with various clients at each site. Our company was recently purchased and all of the clients accounts she handles were moved off site to a different center in Texas. As a result they are now forcing her to work from home due to her client no longer being on site. All they did was provide her with a company laptop with VPN access. Nothing more, not even a monthly internet stipend which is now required for her to do her job. Aside from the internet costs in our town she has several other reasons why working from home not work for her at all. Is this something a company can legally do?  She is completely freaking out about this and was in my office just an absolute wreck the other day and no one in our company seems to give a shit.

{"question":" Sometimes in the 90's when I was 13 or 14, I slapped my brother with a necktie (I was still wearing the tie around my own neck, if you can picture this ).   My mother,  somewhat crazy, was pissed about it so she \"took me to court\".    What I  remember was that she drove me to the police station one day, where I was sat down in front of a prosecutor and I was sentenced to 2-3 weekends of beach cleanup duty and 30 days house arrest without monitoring.   There was no \"trial\",  there was no \"plea\" and I wasn't allowed to speak.   The lady kept saying \"ASSAULT WITH A NECKTIE\" and most people took this to mean I was choking him to death with a necktie or something nuts.\n\nI tried to tell them, all I did was flick my tie upward with my hand, once - but they wouldn't let me speak.  The lady said \"If I have a question for you I will ask you.\"  It was almost like my mother set all of this up and the court agreed to do it for her.  \n\nThen my mother was even more furious, as all of this cost her fees... and she had to drive me to community service.  \n \n\nSo anyway... here goes.  Was I convicted of a crime?   Was I convicted of assault?  Or domestic violence?

The abortion was the choice of the girl and\/or her parents. Your friend *should* have no responsibility. IANAL.\n\nEthically?

The right thing would be to pay for half. If they did decide to sue over it (which i don't know what they would sue for), it would be taken to small claims court.

{"question":"So I'm in an annoying situation right now. My mom's trying to upgrade her Internet from some sort of DSL analog with download speeds of ~3 MB\/s to ATT Uverse with 24 MB\/s. The ATT conduit is located a few houses down and so, during installation yesterday, a cable had to be run through the neighbor's backyard (who wasn't home during installation) and then appeared by a community lake (so public property) that we then looped into our yard. When the ATT guy was working yesterday, he noticed another cable that had been cut that went through said backyard. Today when I got home from the dentist, the Internet was down and I called tech support and after trying various different things, my internet didn't come back. So, a tech is being sent tomorrow morning to figure out what's wrong. I called the tech from yesterday and he said he could swing by during his lunch break to help out; he was only five minutes away and lo and behold my cable is cut.

{"question":" My ex girlfriend and I had an apartment together and when things ended between us I told her I was going out of state to get settled somewhere new and would come back for my dog and other personal items after I was settled and had the money to fly my dog back with me.   \n\n\nWe maintained contact the whole time. I sent her money for food and flea medication, as well as sent money to my dog sitter who watched him during the days.   \n\n\nIts now been a month, I'm finally settled in and have a new job. my ex contacted me a few days ago saying that she didn't want to watch my dog anymore and I arranged for my mom to pick him up yesterday.   \n\n\nUpon arrival we learned that she sold my dog to the dog sitter who has no intention of ever giving him back to me. They said they waited for 30 days before making the sale legal.   \n\n\nWhat steps do I need to take to get my dog back? Can she leggaly do that?   \n\n\nShe knew i was coming back and I'm so shocked and blindsighted. \n","answer":" Find any evidence you have you own the dog. Adoption papers, vet bills, photos, whatever.\n\nContact the police, file a police report for theft. Dogs are considered property and no amount of \"waiting 30 days\" makes it legal to sell something that does not belong to you OR legal to keep something you bought that was actually stolen.\n\nFind out the name or address of the person the dog was sold to. Go ask them to give it back. Sometimes the police will come with you to get it.Answer #2: You're allowed to leave your property with someone else who offers to look after it while you are temporarily looking for a new place. Likewise, the person watching your property has the right to decide they no longer want to watch your property and let you find someone else who will or let you come retrieve it. In no circumstances are they allowed to sell your property to someone else, nor is someone in this situation able to legally acquire ownership of your property from such a sale.\n\nSo you have an ex who illegally sold your property, and you have a pet sitter who knowingly bought your property from someone who does not have the right to sell it.\n\nCall the police for whatever area your ex\/pet-sitter reside and file a report for theft of property. Best case: they surrender your dog; Worst case: you need to sue the Pet Sitter to return your dog."}

All of a sudden i hear my landloard yelling that the gate was open and too get the dogs. I had no notice of him comming and immideatly freaked out. Ill admit i didnt get the dogs in immideatly. After he yelled that i basicly said \" what the hell are you doing here? Close ths damn gate!\" after that he started cussing me out saying the yard needed too be mowed and he was just inspecting the yard? And while he was cussing me out my dog apparently bit him, i did not see it happen because i was inside trying too call my mom and keep my child inside. Eventually i just locked all my doors and he left. Now hes texting my mom saying that he is going too the cops about the dog bite and that he will be coming in three days too come inside and take pictures of our house. So i guess i want too know is 1. Can he do that? Just take pictures of my personal belongings for no reason? 2. Im pretty sure the cops will laugh him out of the room because he got bit while trespassing, right? What should we do too prepare? My moms worried about ua getting evictied but doesnt he need an actual reason for that? Also he was super drunk when this happend but im not sure that changez anything.

{"question":"My wife is an employed professional (exempt).  Her employer is doing some renovations to the office.  Apparently there were not enough funds to do everything her \"boss\" (company has a very ambiguous org chart) wanted.  Therefore, the boss is expecting all of professionals in the office to share the cost of artwork she wants on the walls.  The artists are approved by the company although there do not seem to be any apparent ethical safeguards against kickbacks and such.  It is unclear who would actually \"own\" the art.\n\nI have tried to google about the legality of this but always find charity donation scenarios instead of directly buying things for the company.  It seems like there would be some employment laws against this?  However, I realize exempt employees have very few protections relative to others.  Thank you for any help.\n","answer":" Well, they can't \"force\" her to buy the artwork, nor can they take money out of her paycheck to pay for it without her consent.\n\nBut \"at will employment\" means that she can be fired for any reason or no reason at all (except membership in a protected class) so, as stupid as it sounds, she could actually be fired over this. \n\nHow do the other professionals in the office feel about this idea? One person saying no it likely to go poorly for that person, but multiple people saying no might tie their hands more. \n\nHaving said that though, I'd be highly concerned about the solvency of her employer (both now and into the future) if they can't even complete a renovation without running out of funds.

She does this tactfully, by saying she wouldn't be comfortable working on areas outside of her expertise.

{"question":"My wife is a retail store manager, and has been with the company for over 10 years. Actually, she started at one company, and was bought out by current company. \n\nShe has been a great employee, even winning a VERY big prize last year for the best managers(only 50 store managers out of 1500 locations won this award). A few months ago, she got a new boss. This new boss has been giving her hell, nit picking little things that normally wouldn't be called out, saying the hard work she's put in wasn't actually her, and many other things. \n\nWe have an infant who she is breast feeding, however the stress is causing her milk supply to drop. I know this is not the company or her boss's concern, but it is a side effect of the situaton. \n\nToday she just found out that her boss spoke to her employees behind her back, and told them to write up things that she is doing wrong.

I don't know that this counts as a hostile work environment, but the fact that she is getting so much shit for petty things, and she has been a great employee, until this manager showed up. \n","answer":" No she cannot quit and still get unemployment because her boss doesn't like her. Answer #2: Hostile Work Environment is a legal term of art and contrary to popular belief, it does not mean that the workplace was hostile in the colloquial sense. Rather, it refers to a pattern of discrimination or harassment as a result of an employee's membership in a protected class. Please see [this link from the EEOC](http:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/laws\/types\/harassment.cfm) to better understand the advice you may receive.

{"question":"Hi, i just received a speeding ticket and needed some advice. The ticket was for 91 in a 50 zone, i was stopped by the city police officer and was able to provide license, registration and insurance. The officer was pretty cool after he realized i was just a stupid teenager. He only cited me for speed but i have to appear in court. This was my 3rd ticket in 6 months in ohio. My question i guess is how screwed am i as far as keeping my license? Will a lawyer be able to help me keep school and work privileges?  I honestly have learned my lesson this time. I will probable sell my civic si and get the slowest vehicle possible if i can still drive. This will be i. The mayors court this Wednesday. Thanks.\n","answer":"  If you want to save your license you should get a lawyer. Even then I kind of doubt it. Have you done the math on speeding? Unless you're traveling something close to 500 miles it doesn't end up making much of a difference.  Between stoplights, traffic, and rest stops you don't get that much of a time advantage – particularly considering the enhanced risk of a ticket. \n\nIf you lose your license it will be what you deserve.  Three speeding tickets in six months is insane. I was a crazy teenager and I didn't even get close to that. That means you are way, way over the line. Your insurance costs will go through the roof. \n\n Still, You need to max out your liability coverage. $250,000 or $1 million minimum. Driving at 91 miles an hour if you get into a collision with another car you can ruin many lives. You don't want a judgment of that size hanging around your neck for the rest of your life.Answer #2: You're young with no experience. Your license is toast, my friend.\n\nIt's one thing to speed, but it's another to intentionally put lives in danger. If you were in Virginia, you would be a criminal.Answer #3: 3rd in 6 months? Plus driving 40 mph over the limit. \n\nYou can get a lawyer but I don't think you should bother. You're already at a disadvantage because you're young and you deserve to lose your license for a while IMO"}
{"question":"So, for reasons I won't get into but might be evident from my username, I need to no longer be living with my girlfriend. Information:\n\nWe live in Massachusetts, on a month to month lease that only my name is on, have been in the apartment since the beginning of september. The majority of the items in the apartment are mine, I've paid the majority of the bills (maybe around 60-40 or 65-35 split), with rent being split right down the middle, where she pays me half and then I give a check for full amount to landlord.\n\nHow do I go about doing this? Do I just give her a notice to vacate before the end of the month? How long does that entitle her to have to move out? When would eviction happen? How do I protect my stuff? Obviously taking pictures of valuables with timestamps is a good start, but is there any other thing worthwhile to do? To what extent can I record in my own home? Obviously not the bathroom, but can I record the bedroom? Common areas?\n\nI realize that's a lot of questions, but I'm a little lost at the moment, and if this is a time sensitive thing, I'd like to get the ball rolling ASAP.

{"question":"I live in an apartment in Upstate New York. When we moved in we requested dead bolts on the doors but that request was met with silence.

{"question":"Hello everyone. I have questions regarding a recent job and the payments associated with the job. \n\nSome background: I was contacted by the employer through my university's job page as I have allowed myself to be found by those my university allows. My employer is a painter who seems to travel very often and due to that, requires someone to manage his mail and other such things. The weird part is the salary. He said it would be $500 dollars a WEEK for managing mail, buying paints and donating it to orphanages and managing bills for those who buy his paintings. \n\nHis preferred form of payment was through what he called an e-check where he would send me the check through e-mail, and then I would print the check onto a paper made to print checks on which I already have acquired. My fear is that:\n\n1. It's a lie and the person is trying to scam me.\n\n2. I could get accused of trying to print false checks or something like that. \n\nI spoke with my bank and they were unable to check if the check wasn't fraudulent because the bank which my employer uses is the Bank of Hawaii and I live in California. They said if the check did turn out to be false, the bank would just take the money back and that's it. They also recommended to let the check process a couple of days to prevent the check from being taken back if it turned out to be false. \n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n","answer":" Brushing away the debris a bit, your job is:\n\n1. you will be paid by cheque, and\n2. you will spend that money quickly in ways that benefit the person sending you the cheques, who is at arms' length from you otherwise and will be hard to track down\n\nThis is the basic structure of a very common scam, and the high pay and virtuous elements of the pitch are common embellishments. The funds for the cheques will be released to your account quickly, but the cheques will not clear and the funds will eventually (in 30 to 90 days, well after you will have been asked to spend the money) be removed from your account. If you have already spent the money, that will send you deep into overdraft, and recovering your money will be very difficult.\n\nThe element where you print the paper cheques is less relevant than you might expect, but may expose you to additional criminal risk if the receiving bank believes you are intentionally attempting to defraud them yourself.\n\nIf your employer isn't willing to negotiate some other means of transferring money to you (for example, a wire transfer) to handle his business, then walk away.

{"question":"Hello Reddit,\n\nMy father and I have the same name and he used my identity when I was a minor. He bought a house under my name (Also running up a ton of credit cards) which I had to fight hard to fix when I finally became an adult and was aware of the situation.\n\nI received a letter that the house insurance company my dad used owes me $980 for some reason or another, and because they couldn't contact me they placed the money in a trust fund with the state.

First, while $980 is a lot of money, it is not enough to \"change your life.\" Second, should anybody ever go tracing the funds, you would basically give them a paper trail right back to you. Third, if anybody cared to check, it would look like you were trying to benefit from your father's crimes. Fourth, imagine the legal cost if somebody did try to say you were stealing the money. Surely that is way more than $980. Even if the money can legally be claimed, I would not claim it. Answer #2: I agree you shouldn't touch it or you undo all the work it took to clear up the identity theft. I personally would contact the state and tell them the situation and point them to your father.

{"question":"Hey all, so about 2 years ago I get an offer for a magazine subscription. I figure I'll sign up and if I don't like it I can just cancel. After about a month, I try to cancel and they claim that I can't because they pay for the magazines for the next year ahead of time so I have to pay them back. This was never expressed to me before I agreed to the service. I call them and tell them about this and they tell me I still have to pay. Me being naive I follow along with it. I then get calls from companies introducing themselves, and then asking if I have been getting my magazines. I hear this so I think they must be the company I'm already signed up through. They ask to reconfirm my info, so I do so, and then I get signed up for more magazines. I've continued paying for them in hopes to just be done with it, but I recognize that they'll probably keep finding someway to keep charging me or take advantage of me. \n\nCurrently, I have subscriptions from Periodical services, Magazine Solutions, and Pioneer Publishing. What can I do about this? From what I've read about the statute of frauds I'm not beholden to them to pay since the price that they were asking for is over $500 and for something of that price it requires a written contract. But I figured I'd comment here and see if there is any other option available to me. \n","answer":" &gt;I hear this so I think they must be the company I'm already signed up through.

Go through the motions to terminate the contract now. Like, if they require at least 60 days notice and you're actually still 100 days out, give notice now anyway. "}

I really needed water but didnt want to get in trouble. The manager already hated me because i went to upper management about him. He would time me in the bathroom and told me that 4 min and 22 sec was WAY to long for a female to be in the bathroom. (which cleaning the bathroom was also part of my job so i dont know how im supposed to check all 5 stalls go to the bathroom and wash my hands in less then 4 min but ok) anyway\n\nI ended up passing out manager made them take me to the hospital.

Employers frequently tell employees they will pay the medical bills to avoid filing a work comp claim, and that is presumably what happened here. Problem is statue of limitations on work comp claims is usually two years, but it’s worth calling a work comp attorney about it. If you are in fact barred by the SOL, you could look into a breach of contract claim, but I cannot speak to the merits of that. First, you should contact a work comp attorney, then maybe a contract or employment attorney depending on how things go with the work comp attorney. Regardless of the lawyers, you should contact the hospital and let them know of the circumstances. They may be able to lower the bills, take them out of collections, or help you out in some other way. "}

{"question":"My husband and I are renting a property that has a short spiked fence with a sliding gate to the driveway. We don't use a lock on the gate because there isn't a space for us to put a discrete lock on it.\n\nTonight one of our neighbors came into the property and shook the security door that protects our front door while trying to knock because it has a mosquito net and she couldn't quite reach our front door.

{"question":"Throwaway for reasons - \n\nTo preface this, my brother works in finance for a car dealership. Every finance deal he does with a certain bank, he is awarded $100 from the dealership. As a company, if they hit a collective goal with that bank they get lower interest rates which is why they give individuals the $100 incentive. \n\nIn September, my brother completed 5 deals with said bank, and received the $500 on his November 1st paycheck. In October, he completed 13 deals totaling $1300. His paycheck he received on December 1st was only for $800, citing a $500 deduction. They deducted his September deals because they implemented a new policy on 11\/29 stating that if the company didn't reach their collective goal, incentives wouldn't be paid out. \n\nSo my question is, can they deduct something they already paid him, for a new rule they just enacted? \n\nLet me know if this wasn't clear. First time posting here. \n","answer":" Location matters a lot here. Generally if he earned it under the old rule he's due it.Answer #2: It may vary by state but as a rule of thumb your employer can’t deduct anything from your paycheck without your signature or a government orderAnswer #3: Depends on location. \n\nIn some places bonuses &amp; commission that aren't written into the employment contract are completely up to the employer and can be revoked at **any** stage up to and including the date of payment.\n\nNow while this means they can't retroactively take back Septembers pay, they can in effect do the same thing by taking the $500 off the October bonus for any and no reason that doesn't fall under a protected class (i.e. not a reason that would give rise to a discrimination suit).Answer #4: Side issue - is the bonus to the dealership fully disclosed to the buyers?

{"question":"\n","answer":" Basically it's a catch-all.  \"Moral rights\" refers to the right of attribution and against presenting your work in a negative light, regardless of who actually owns the copyright.  For example, if I were to buy a copy of your picture and say \"this is my work\" then that would be an infringement of your moral rights in the copyright.\n\nThe US doesn't explicitly protect moral rights, the rights are captured under other areas of the law.  It's a much bigger issue in the EU."}

There are no signs that say you can't park there, and his customers are always kind of illegally idling all over street when the place is open as well. \n\nDoes he have any leg to stand on as far as calling the cops about this, or is he just a delusional prick?

{"question":"Background: my ex and I got pregnant very early into our relationship, at first we were happy about the possibility of having a family then everything soured when she came to me and asked for an abortion now I’m not saying women don’t have a right to their own bodies but I was a little upset when she told me, I told her I was upset and she essentially said my body my rules. I went along with it and even went as far as to take out a credit card to cover the abortion she told me that she felt like she couldn’t love the baby in anyway capacity and referred to it as a parasite on a daily basis, then one day out of nowhere she decides she wants to keep the baby, A few months later I find out she has been texting her ex on and off for the entire relationship and went as far as to hide his name under one of her friends names. Shortly after our son was born we broke up and she has made it to where I am only allowed to see him once a week for a maximum of 12 hours, when he was born we signed an affidavit claiming that I was the father, there has been no legal document saying that I can’t see my son but she is trying to make it where I can’t see him unless it’s convenient for her while also still paying $300 a month in child support which I might add is also not being court ordered. The problem I’m having now is that I’m afraid to go through the court system because I am currently living with my mother who has a record and I’m afraid that if this does go to court that I will be stripped of all rights of seeing my son even though I’m trying to play an active role in his life, any sort of help would be greatly appreciated more than you will ever know.\n","answer":" Absent a court order she doesn't have to allow you access.

{"question":"Hey guys. So I got a ticket for \"texting and driving\" and I need reddit's advice.\n\nI just dropped someone off in Garden Grove, CA and was about to head home. I was nearing a street and because I was unfamiliar with the area, I needed to know if I had to make a right or left. (I suck with directions, especially when it comes to going back from the direction I came from... Anyhow, the intersection I was approaching just turned red and there were a few cars in front of me. The cars stopped and so did I. At a complete stop, I pulled out my phone to type in the address for the gps. (The app doesnt even let me type while driving. It locks with movement) While at a full stop and typing, in the lane next to me, a motorcycle officer slows to a stop BUT leaves about 4 cars worth of space... so I knew something was up. Light turns green and she gets behind me and pulls me over. She does her bit, saying I cant text and drive. I tried to explain what happened but she would not hear anything I had to say. (It was pretty damn rude. Literally ignored me)\nOh! Also, it even said on the ticket that I was moving at \"0 mph\"\n\n\nSo my question is: could I fight this ticket? If they looked at my phone records, they would clearly be able to see that I had not a) received a text in the past hour or so, b) I had not sent a text during the past hour, and c) the app I have keeps logs... I think... and would show that I had searched for directions at the time that the ticket was given.\n\n\n**I was searching the internet and I found this case and this was the summary: \"Using cellphone as GPS not subject to Calif. driving law, court rules.

{"question":"As stated above the recruiter told her she probably was SOL.  She recently was accepted to dental school and was planning recruiting with the military to finance it and serve for a given time after graduation.  We were both shocked when she was told that by the Air Force recruiter.  The charge was a felony assault on a police officer from 11 years ago (She spit at an officer) which was dismissed.  She was however given community service which is the justification the recruiter listed as the problem.  I guess \"community service = guilt, instead of  dismissed = dismissed\"?  And one last thing, she was told by the court that the dismissed charge would be wiped from her record after 5 years and it was not.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

As odd as it sounds it happens, I can attest to not remembering a damn thing about a charge I was picked up on as a child but remember it involved community service, and I'm an attorney myself. It sounds to me that when she says \"dismissed\" she is recalling that the charge was either subject to something like a conditional discharge or an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal. Community service is often required by the DA in exchange for the offer. So, she may be fine with the armed services after all. She should go to the clerk of the county\/city where the offense was committed and ask, if they cant tell her with a quick search she should request a copy of her DCJS or whatever your state's equivalent of a rap sheet is. \n\nThe \"dismissed charge would be wiped in 5 years\" part also sounds like a misremembrance.

{"question":"Hello,\n\nIn January I moved out of Apartment complex A and moved into a new apartment complex. I left the old apartment in good condition and took pictures when I left. I found out by looking at my bank statements in early March that my former landlord took my entire security deposit and charged $400 for replacing the carpets (This appeared on my statement then, it did not show in January or February).\n\nThe apartment was about 80% wood floors with minimal carpeting, which upon move in I was told it was new. My photos show it was in good condition, and the apartment complex says they did not take any photos of the new carpet nor do they have receipts showing that work was actually done. \n\nUpon reviewing my lease I found that they must notify me within 30 days if they are withholding any part of the security deposit, which they have not done.\n\nLast week I found a charge from a random collection agency for $400. As I only used that account for rent, and calling the collection agency showed they obtained my info from my old apartment complex, which means the old apartment complex gave my bank information to a 3rd party.

{"question":"This is a pretty long story and it got hairy, but I'm trying to figure out if I have any legal ground if the cat isn't returned to me.\n\nOn May 22, my new kitten that I had gotten a few days before escaped. The next day when I realised, I posted all over Facebook, next-door, etc with a $200 reward to whoever finds and returns her. Over the next few days, until May 30, I posted multiple times about my missing pet and over time I upped the reward to $1000 and checked the shelters website numerous times a day to see if she was put in. \n\nOn July 12, somebody posted on Facebook that they may have found my cat. They posted the picture on the shelter website and I was 100% sure she was mine! I sent an email to the shelter requesting it back. What I then found out was that an hour before I sent the email, my cat was adopted. Now here's the hairy details, I found out that the cat has been in the shelter since May 24 and she had a photo up on the website, but the photo was really poorly taken and you couldn't ID her, the breed was incorrectly assumed, they put her as medium hair when she's a long and they marked her age as 1yr8months when she was really 7 months old. I guess with the combination of all of this, but especially the poor photo, she must've gotten overlooked when I went looking. So apparently, if a cat is unclaimed for 4 days, it becomes city property. But how is it fair that she becomes city property with a poor photo and lots of wrong details where I couldn't ID her. They didn't take a new photo until July 5, but since she was in the shelter for so long, I was constantly looking at either new intakes or cats who were below 1 years old.

They hired a new assistant manager, she seemed nice, nothing out of the ordinary, previous retail experience, but honestly, has a kind of trashy personality (talks about people a lot, a 10 min conversation with you and you'll find at least 3 lies, obviously compulsive.) About 3 weeks pass, nothing weird or out of the ordinary so far, but i go to work one day, and out of nowhere shes has a HUGE stomach, and is now pregnant.

{"question":"Live in South Carolina. Florida resident (Military).\n\nMy wife has been texting a lot lately and I had a feeling she might be talking to another guy. After she went to sleep tonight I got her phone to look into it. Turns out I was right.\n\nIt seems by the texts that they have not had intercourse yet, but have been sending sexual texts, pictures, and planned to have him come to my house while I am at work tomorrow (presumably to have sex).\n\nI sent myself screenshots of all the incriminating messages\/pictures, and deleted all record of screenshoting\/sending them from her phone.\n\nI plan on going to talk to a lawyer about my best course of action ASAP.\n\nMy main questions here are:\n\nShould I confront her in the morning, or leave for \"work\" at my normal time and go talk to a lawyer without mentioning it to her?\n\nWe have a daughter that is about to turn four. If I can prove adultry with the texts, how would it change divorce and custody battles?\n","answer":" &gt;Should I confront her in the morning, or leave for \"work\" at my normal time and go talk to a lawyer without mentioning it to her?\n\nIf you're determined to seek divorce immediately, then there's no purpose in a confrontation.\n\n&gt;We have a daughter that is about to turn four. If I can prove adultry with the texts, how would it change divorce and custody battles?\n\nWell, if she hasn't had sex, there is no adultery.\n\nThis is 2018, not 1950.  Most divorce is no-fault, and unless she's done something like had sex in front of the child, it's not likely to impact custody.  If you can prove she's actually committed adultery, it might impact spousal support, but that's it.Answer #2: If you confront her in this, all that you accomplish is to inform her that you know about *this* incident. If she's determined to cheat--and her making plans to do so while you're out certainly suggests it--then the next time will be better hidden from you. Further, you also inform her that any divorce proceedings should happen on **her** terms, not yours; you'll probably be back in here in due time asking for advice to handle that mess. Finally, depending on how this confrontation plays out, you could well find yourself in the backseat of a squad car being taken in for a domestic incident charge of some sort.\n\nEdit: While those texts may not affect your divorce and\/or custody efforts, a domestic charge accompanied by a protective order damn sure will, so that's another reason to not even get into anything with her.\n\nJust avoid that crap, go see your attorney.

{"question":"My wife recently filed for divorce in retaliation to me declining to sign agreement forms for embryo adoption a month after she moved out due to years of an unhappy marriage (following 4 years of infertility struggles, depression, etc.). The embryo adoption would be scheduled for Oct-Nov so she needs a divorce ASAP in order to be the only required signature on the adoption forms as my state (Illinois) requires a 6 month separation period before granting divorce. In order to bypass this, she has cited emotional abuse and drug abuse as the reasons for divorce.\n\nMy question is, does this have any implications for me? Are there any legal ramifications to me if I just agree to the divorce on these terms? I am willing and likely able to fight the accusations but if it doesn't have any impact on me, I'd rather get out immediately.\nTopic:\nCustody Divorce and Family\n","answer":" Not from Illinois, so I don't know specific divorce laws.\n\nThat said, in many states, there are likely implications as far as how things such as alimony and property division would be determined if the divorce was under conditions that implicate you having broken the law (i.e. drug abuse, even if you don't get 'charged' with it, would tend to be something the court wouldn't look kindly on.)\n\nSounds like you should lawyer up, however.

You didn’t do anything wrong and have nothing to be embarrassed about.  \n\nAnswer #3: Report it to the police, in most cases, simulated pornography is treated like the real thing. If any of the pictures of you and your friends are from before you're 18, the people uploading the pictures could be investigated for underage pornography.\n\nConsider that people who do this are often stalkers and abusers.

{"question":"Okay, so. Brother in law moved in with us in June to get a \"second start\" from a bad home life (he's 33 we're 22). We have been supporting him since June, paying bills, food, and even buying him cigarettes. He found a job and quit within two week, starting sleeping with a 19 year old and got her knocked up. Went against our wishes multiple times but of course my husband kept convincing me to let him stay because it's his brother. He finally got a job and has been working. Our landlord came to us with a deal that if we could pay $1000 by the 15th of November he would wipe the other $1000 we owe him for the house clean and sign over the title. Brother in law said he'd do it, we'd let him stay until January without pay and he wouldn't have to pay us back for the last 5 months. He's known about this for a month.

{"question":"Hello everyone, I am posting this for someone that is not on reddit but going to ask this in their POV.\nMy wife and I had 2 children at a young age \"by mistake\" but we love our children. We got married after our second child and then less than 6 months into the marriage my wife cheated on me multiple times with strangers and ex boyfriends. I stayed completely faithful and never strayed.\nMy day to day life is as follows: 1.Go to work 2. take care of kids. 3. Study for school to improve things\nMy wife has left our home on various occasions without any notice or help with the children to travel for days or weeks at a time to see new men. She has admitted this, it's not suspicion. After telling me she was fine if I had a girlfriend of my own (we've agreed divorce will happen), she has harassed any woman I have gotten close to with verbal threats and also damaged my personal property as \"punishment\" such as my personal laptop. I realize that since we are married, my property is legally my wife's, however my wife has now started to threaten me daily to destroy all of my personal belongings any time I don't answer a question of hers or follow her commands. The last time this happened she was asking me what conversation I had with my own mother and I didn't want to tell her...so she went into my bedroom, grabbed my laptop, held it over her head and said \"tell me what you said\", when i refused..she dropped the laptop onto our tile floor.

Answer #2: &gt; I realize that since we are married, my property is legally my wife's\n\nThat's not completely accurate. In particular, you may be able to hold your wife liable for the damage she causes and use that to justify decreasing her share of the marital assets during your divorce, and her destroying property to control you may constitute domestic violence or criminal mischief that the police would be interested in.\n\nPrevention is easier than cure, though. It's time to move your valuables out of your ex wife's reach. A safety deposit box or a storage locker in your name only is a good start. Talk to your attorney about getting an interim custody and visitation order set up so that you can move out without losing access to your children.

It is fairly difficult for my car to do 86 mph and I very rarely drive over 70 so I am very doubtful I was actually doing that speed and feel like I was screwed over by a cop taking advantage of someone on Halloween night and at the end of the month. My court date is January 20th because you have to attend for super speeder tickets. Just wondering if there's any way of fighting it or getting it reduced since I really do feel wronged here. I was also given a breathalizer because he thought I was drunk but I passed it. I think he may have been agitated that I was not drunk when he pulled me over.\n","answer":" &gt;  Just wondering if there's any way of fighting it\n\nThe ticket should have instructions on the process for challenging it.  You're free to do that.\n\nHaving said that, a large issue with your defense is that you don't actually know how fast you were going.  The officer will testify that you were going 86, based upon whatever means he measured that.  Your rebuttal testimony will be, effectively, \"No way, dude!\"  That doesn't generally work very well.\n\nAlso, you should refrain from complaining about \"getting screwed\" when you were stopped for speeding.  You admit you were going *at least* 15 miles over the limit.  Judges generally don't like when people whine about getting caught red-handed."}

Perhaps it was bad timing (middle of the night in FL), or something else, but please don't downvote in case it is not relevant to your expertise. Any advice and\/or pointers are very appreciated.\n\nLong time redditor, but posting from an alt account.\n\nAbout 13 years ago I was convicted for a drug trafficking offense and sentenced to 2 years in prison. As a non US citizen or permanent resident, I was immediately deported to my home country in Europe after serving time.\n\nSome time ago I googled my own name, and it appears I have a outstanding warrant in FL for violation of probation. Upon further investigation it was revealed that the violation of probation was for DUI offense that happened few days prior to the drug arrest and resulted in probation, which I obviously couldn't complete as a result of deportation.\n\nI contacted the Attorney General's office and explained my situation, and they basically agreed that it was made in error, but that they couldn't do anything about it.

{"question":"A married couple bought a home in my neighborhood, the company that they own is turning it into a sober living facility. \nThe HOA (Home Owners Association) has strict rules against using the home solely as a business. The HOA also has strict rules against short term tenants.  \nThe HOA's lawyers say that the HOA can't prevent this from happening because the couple is protected by ADA (American's with Disabilities Act) since the people living there will be recovering addicts and alcoholics. The HOA can't prevent them from moving in because it would be discrimination against people with disabilities. The people living there must be treated as residents and not tenants and not a business.\nI can't find the definition of resident within the ADA or HUD (Housing and Urban Development). \nCan I get a little help? What's the difference between a resident and a tenant? if you don't own a property and are paying to be at that property, aren't you a tenant?\n\nAlso, the county inspectors said that they don't need to be ADA compliant because they should be treated like residents.\nIt seems to me that if you're calling on ADA laws to save you, you should be ADA compliant.\nDoes anyone know more about this?\n\nThis all sounds so absurd. I can't believe how the law is written.\n\nTopic:\nReal Estate law\n","answer":" Well, unfortunately your HOA's lawyer is correct.\n\nThat does not mean that they are free to violate HOA regulations though.  You need to talk to the HOA and basically fine the fuck out of the owners for every infraction, if you are seeking a legal recourse to removing the halfway house.  \n\nI know California was considering laws requiring certification of recovery residences, but I'm not sure that went anywhere.  You might try contcting the Sober Living Network or the National Alliance of Recovery Residences to see if they have any recommendations on how to deal with a recovery residence that is bringing issues to the neighborhood.  They might have a shared interest in ensuring that recovery residences don't cause problems in the neighborhood.\n\nAnswer #2: I would recommend you and all your neighbors invest in some security cameras.

Find somewhere else to live, not with your soon to be ex-husband. Answer #2: After moving out, do a factory reset on your cellphone, and then use it to change passwords on any accounts you have. Don't even use the same pattern of passwords (if you had been using character names from a favourite show, don't use character names from any show you watch), and set recovery questions\/answers to things he doesn't know about. Reason for the factory reset is to wipe out keyloggers - any device to which he's had physical access is suspect until examined by a professional and cleared. Cellphones (generally) don't have enough space to install a hardware keylogger, but computers (even laptops) have the space. Factory reset wipes out installed programs, including software keyloggers."}
{"question":"I thought this was a really interesting question that \/u\/oddun posed elsewhere. As an EU citizen, is the government allowed to strip my EU citizenship and rights without my consent? I thought it was an interesting legal question and wonder the validity of such an argument if someone wanted to take it to court. \n\nIt seems like this would be pretty illegal to me, especially considering the government is refusing to allow this to go to a parliamentary vote. Considering I voted remain, and under no terms do I want to leave the EU on a personal level, regardless of the country as a whole, would someone be able to take that argument to court and have a case?\n\nAlso, this isn't a political question, it's more of a 'what if' scenario, genuinely interested to see what people have to say!\n\nI thought maybe someone here would be able to answer this, as it is not something I have seen posted anywhere else. Thanks!\n","answer":" Honestly, that's something that no one can answer right now because there is no precedent, as no nation has ever left the EU. It's a question that will no doubt be hashed out in the EU councils and most likely the courts for a long time to come. \n\nThe best argument that I could see is that there is technically no such thing as an \"EU citizenship\" because the EU is not a sovereign state as such; it's a confederation of individual sovereign member states (albeit one with some federal characteristics). \"EU citizenship\" is just a shorthand way of saying \"citizenship of a state that is a member of the EU.\" If the state of which you are a citizen secedes from the confederation, then you would no longer be a citizen of a member nation and thus no longer part of the EU, simple as that. \n\nOf course, practically speaking, even with the hardest of hard Brexits, with no freedom of movement or trade and no EU influence over British law, there will no doubt be accommodations made in certain situations, such as granting some sort of residency rights to British citizens already living in other EU states. In general though, British citizens can't really remain \"EU citizens\" if Britain leaves the EU. "}
{"question":"So I'm not too familiar with employment\/labour law in Ontario, Canada (where we're from) and I'm asking this for my mom. She worked for a company for 2 months (she passed the 1 month probation period) and was told she would have 2 weeks of vacation a year. As it got closer to tax season she was asked to work overtime (she accumulated around 100 hours) and was to be compensated with more vacation time. However, after 2 months, she made a mistake with payroll confirmation (it did not go through on pay day) and was subsequently fired. They paid her for her normal hours but told her that because she was paid monthly and that her overtime was to be compensated with vacation days, she will not be getting money for the overtime hours she worked. But because she's no longer employed she can't even use those vacation days. \n\nIs this legal? Is she entitled to those overtime hours? \n","answer":" She can be fired for making a mistake, and since she was only there for 2 months, there is no statutory requirement for payment in lieu of notice.  \n\nYou mentioned tax season, so she should be aware that there are some occupations that are exempt from overtime provisions, such as CPAs. If she is not exempt, she should make sure that she does not have an averaging agreement, because that could impact the amount of overtime she is owed.\n\nOntario does allow employers, with written permission from employees, to provide vacation time instead of payment for overtime, but the employer still must follow the rules - i.e. if the time should be paid at time and a half, it should be accumulated at time and a half as well.\n\nCall the Ministry of Labour to get this sorted out."}
{"question":"I was commuting from San Francisco to Mountain View a few days ago and near San Francisco International Airport, when I noticed a reckless driver in a white Chevrolet Van. He was speeding and tailgating everyone to get ahead of the traffic. \n\nHe tried to tailgate me as well but I had nothing I could do as there were cars in front of me and next to me. After that, he rapidly sped up and aligned himself next to me and despite my attempt to let him know that there is a vehicle to his right, he proceeded to merge onto my vehicle in a seemingly purposeful way. He didn't signal and continued to merge despite the collusion and my honking.\n\nI took the next exit after that but he was speeding away at that point, essentially running away from the crime scene. He also attempted to fall behind my car after the collusion so that I wouldn't be able to get his license plate number.\n\nWell, the best part of the incident is that, while the car is damaged, it is in working condition and nothing worse has happened. But the most exciting part of this is that I do have crystal clear dashcam footage of his vehicle running away the crime scene, and also purposefully merging on me. Now, as far as I know, there is a possibility that what he has done can be considered \"assault with a deadly weapon\" in California, and I would like to pursue this if possible.\n\nWhat are the steps that I need to follow? I've already told my insurance company about all of this, and told them I can provide them with the footage.\n\nThanks.\n","answer":" Call the police, report the crime, and make that video available to them.Answer #2: Don't get too excited about this being \"assault with a deadly weapon\" under California Penal Code section 245.\n\nUsually \"vehicular assault\" is charged when there are serious injuries, most commonly in conjunction with reckless driving and DUI.    Assault with a nonfirearm deadly weapon requires also that the circumstances and the weapon provide the:\n\n&gt;\"present ability to apply force likely to produce great bodily injury with a deadly weapon other than a ﬁrearm\"\n\nFrom a legal perspective, this is very likely ordinary hit-and-run.\n\nIt's sweet that you have the dashcam video;  the police will likely appreciate it.

{"question":"Hi guys, out of state hunter in Pennsylvania. Deer season this year I harvested a doe. I didn’t know the acts I had committed were against the law. Long story short neighbor asked if I got anything and I mentioned a doe. Speaking with family I learned it wasn’t in fact doe season. Upon learning the doe was not in season until the following week I went online to the hunting rules website and read mistake kills we basically a 25 dollar fee for them to give you a new doe tag, they take the doe and everyone goes on their merry ways....the fines if caught were like 1500 and 3 months in prison.  I decided to report my mistake kill \n\nUpon speaking with the game commissioner he informed me it was negligent on my part for not knowing the rules and instead charged me with a 500 dollar fine and a s2 charge.\n\nI was charged under chapter 23 title 34 section 2307.\n\nThe one I believe I should be charged for is section 2306.\n\nMy questions for you guys: should I take it to court? I still think it’s classified as a mistake...am I wrongfully interpreting these laws? Is a S2 a bad charge to get? Should I fight it all out in court or should I ask for leniency on the fine\/charge? What should I do guys? \n\nI made a mistake, tried\/am trying to do the honest and right thing. I admit my mistakes, but don’t feel as though it is treated fairly \n","answer":" IANAL but I hunt. A mistaken kill would be if you aimed for a buck but shot the doe by accident, or the Doe was standing in front of a tree and you thought he branches were antlers. Ignorance of the law isn’t considered a mistake in most situations I’ve seen. I think you are being charged correctly, as much as it sucks. I hope a lawyer weighs in with suggestions.Answer #2: You didn't make a mistake, you committed an unlawful taking. You broke the law because you failed to know what it was. That, in legal parlance, is not a mistake. It may be a mistake in your mind, but that isn't how the law works. A mistake would be you thought it was a buck during buck season but it was a doe. (More likely the reverse and you kill a young buck by mistake). Then you would have to follow the procedures set out in 2306 to deal with it.  You were treated fairly. You cannot put a layperson's definition to the words in the law. Those words have specific meanings based on the laws themselves. And mistake, in this situation, does not mean what you think it does.\n\nA lawyer is likely to cost more than $500, so you have to decide if you want to pay more than the fine for the lawyer to see if you can get a lower fine. Otherwise, just go to court, apologize, explain what happened, and see if the judge will knock it down. Or if there is a prosecutor see if they will knock it down."}

{"question":"Hi guys,\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place for this or if personal finance would be better, but here we go. My grandparents are dirt poor and live in rural Florida. Part of the reason for that is that they've been paying off roughly $600\/mo in credit card debt for many years that they can't get themselves out of. After a recent trip to the VA hospital for an appointment, one of the doctors told them they should consider filing for bankruptcy. I'm not entirely sure how that would affect them but I was wondering if you guys could give me a bit of advice on how to advise them. \n\nA little background: they live completely off social security these days and they don't have much in terms of assets: they own 10 acres of (worthless, constantly flooded) land that they have a completely paid for house on. (The property is split into two 5 acre parcels, both have their name on them but my mentally ill mother who can't work lives in a house on the other parcel, this is part of the reason I was a bit concerned about bankruptcy), they own a car outright that is paid off, and they are cosigners on a car that my father pays for and drives but is current on payments.  Should I advise them to proceed? I wish I could offer more help to them but I make a modest living in South FL and the cost of living is insane here.  \n","answer":" It might be worth it. Maybe someone else here can go into more depth than I...\n\n\nYes bankruptcy would eliminate that credit card debt and make life much easier. However, the credit card company will still go after them for assets. They are elderly and on social security so it's unlikely their home or land would be at risk of being seized. \n\n\nIf they have no other assets other than the car then I would look into it. Try talking to a bankruptcy lawyer they will typically do an initial consultation for free. \n\n\n\nAnother strategy you could recommend is just to tell them to stop paying the credit card. If they are old and poor and already have poor credit then a mark on their credit rating won't do any harm. After months of nonpayment it will go to collections. Then typically they will settle for 40% or even less the original balance. "}
{"question":"A month ago I received a letter served at work letting me know my ex has a baby and I am to take a paternity test. I absolutely had no idea she was even pregnant. Long story short, I am the father. I do want to have a relationship with my daughter. I've spoken to the mother and she is willing to work with me to establish parenting time and negotiate child support, insurance, etc. My question is, what items do people typically negotiate in terms of money. For example, does the mother automatically get to claim the child on her taxes in MI? I obviously will cover the child with my health insurance, but if the mother agrees to receive less in the way of monthly child support,  could I offer up to pay half on braces, glasses, pay the 20&amp;#37; of her health care needs, and give mom every year to claim child?  We've spoken to a couple of different lawyers, and we are definitely working on retaining one, but in the meantime, I hoped I could get some clarity on these subjects here. \n","answer":" There isn’t really a negotiation with respect to money. There’s a statutory calculation that takes into account the income of both parents and sets an amount. \n\nYour order is very likely to be at or near the amount set by the calculator. Answer #2: Wait, are you consulting lawyers together or separately? I'd consult a lawyer on your own. Answer #3: You’ll both figure out a schedule or set amounts as to who does what and when while you’re in mediation. Answer #4: To add what others have said, it’s really less of a negotiation than a calculation. If you split custody 50\/50, child support is not needed. If she has more than 50% custody, you’ll pay child support based on your incomes. You can take things like providing health insurance into account when meeting this responsibility. \n\nThe parent who was the child for 183 days or more gets to claim her on their taxes. If you are attempting to split custody 50\/50, some parents take turns claiming the child every other year, that can be formalized in your custody agreement. "}

The company was bought by a company with locations all over the world, and the agreement is now that we cannot work at any tissue bank or similar business ANYWHERE in the world. This seems ridiculous, especially since the skills and experience in a job like this are very niche and not really applicable in any other job position.

{"question":"In the state of Indiana, we have a relative who is going through a rough patch and needed somewhere to stay. We got backed into a corner because we own a property in the state that is empty for the time being. Long story short she moved into the property even though she has young kids and there is no running water at the house. \n\nThey have been staying about a month with the understanding that she would move out as soon as she got a job and got on her feet, but it's not looking like it's going to work out that way. She's now under the impression that she is going to be staying in the home until we move home next year. She did just get a job at a local hardware store, but things are not looking promising.\n\nI know (think?) I can still have her thrown out as a tresspasser, but that seems extreme (not outside the realm of possibility, but just a bit stronger than I'd like). There is also the option to have the court order her out of the home, which is more reasonable.\n\nMy question is two-fold.\n\n1) Are there other options for getting her out? Are there avenues I'm not seeing that she has in discourse? Adverse possession is 10 years in Indiana, so I don't think I need to be worried about that, right?\n\n2) Is there possible blow-back for letting her stay in our house with her 3 kids and no running water? The way I understand it is that the home is technically \"condemned\", but the city understands that it is temporarily uninhabited and not abandoned, so they don't make a fuss. Am I legally liable for her living in an unfit home?\n\nAm I doing anything wrong that I'm not aware of, and what's my best course of action going forward?\n","answer":" She's now your tenant, not a trespasser.  You need to go through a formal eviction process.  It complicates the matter that you willingly allowed someone to live in a place that is condemned.\n\nYou could also call CPS that the mother is having the children stay in a house with no running water.Answer #2: What makes you think she would be considered a trespasser? From your story it seems like she has permission to be there, even though she is not pay rent. Correct me if I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAs for liability, without knowing the exact facts or the case law in IL it is definitely possible you could be on the hook.\n\nWithout a doubt if you were actually renting it to her you would be in trouble for not having running water. Since this is an odd situation I'm not sure if you would be here. However it is almost certain that if someone gets injured at that house you would be liable, especially if it is condemned and you are knowingly let them stay there anyway.\n\nI would trust your gut and try and figure out how to get them out. Talking to them is probably the best. I'm not sure how eviction goes if it turns out the house is unfit to be lived in. You could have them kicked out by the court. It's quite possible that you would have to pay for them to stay somewhere else for awhile (that's how it would be if you had rented them an uninhabitable house). \n\nAlso did you imply you were planning on moving to the house yourself in the next year?

You can push this up the chain with the police department, but I doubt it will go much further. \n\nIn the future, only hire contractors that are insured and bonded. There are many legitimate websites out there that have reviews for contractors in your area.Answer #3: &gt;Fwiw she did do some research into this guy. He had a professional looking site and client reviews we see are now bullshit. So he did LOOK legitimate. His Facebook and website are both gone now.......\n\nEven if he deleted it, may still be possible to find some evidence of who he was between archives and WHOIS info, etc. May require a private investigator of some sort."}
{"question":"My question is pretty much as my post title states. My wife and I had a baby recently. I missed the enrollment window to add my child to my plan and I am being told I now have to wait until our yearly open enrollment to add my kid. \n\nI am going to take this up with HR and ask for forgiveness for the sake of my newborn, but I'd like to know if there are any relevant laws regarding the legality of refusing to allow the addition of a dependent based on what seems like an arbitrary corporate policy.\n\nThis is in Pennsylvania. \n\nAlso, my wife is a SAHM so we don't have an option on her end for insurance.\n\nThanks\n","answer":" If it's 60 days it's not arbitrary at all nor is it their policy but rather the law. They can't add her once the 60 day window has passed.  You can beg but you have no leg to stand on. 60 days is 60 days.Answer #2: It is likely the insurance company that is not allowing it. Your HR department probably has no control over that whatsoever. Answer #3: Yes they can legally make you wait."}
{"question":"Backstory: I got my two bottom wisdom teeth removed yesterday and today i still have heavy numbness on the left side of my bottom lip and chin. In addition to that, i’m experiencing severe pain on the left side of my bottom teeth but not the surgical site. Is there anything I could do resolving a botched oral surgery? I know by now i’m not supposed to be this numb or experiencing this type of pain on teeth that weren’t touched \nTopic:\nMedicine and Malpractice\n","answer":" It’s been a day...you can’t say there’s damage yet. Some patients have residual issues for months. It’s a risk of surgery. Also you should know that the nerve involved runs from the back of the mouth all the way to the front teeth. So it is possible to have the source of pain and the site of pain be different. Chill out.Answer #2: You should go back to the surgeon and report these symptoms and get treated. "}
{"question":"He didn't reside with me or lease or anything.  He was just staying the night a few times and put some of his work things in the shed (I didn't know what he put in there).  We broke up and he said he was coming for his things but never did.  I had them on the curb for him the first night.  The next day I moved them to the driveway and covered them with plastic so they wouldn't get stolen or wet.  Today (day 3) everything is still there.  I notified him and his father that the belongings were there waiting and even told them when I wouldn't be home if they wanted to pick them up (my ex said he would prefer to not see me).  I'm wondering how long I have to keep this stuff on my property since he wasn't a tenant and he's not responding to my requests for him to come get it.  It's ladders, lots of painters drop cloths, paint poles and supplies.\nTopic:\nOther Civil Matters\n","answer":" Send him a certified letter saying that he has 15 days to pick up his stuff and after that you'll consider them abandoned. Answer #2: Though he isn't a tenant, you allowed him to store the property. If you're asking can you sell it on CL, that's a good way to get sued. I would put it back in the shed and let him contact you to make arrangements. Since you removed them and left them outside, if they are damaged or stolen, you're liable. Answer #3: Another option is to pay for self-storage, move the stuff into it, give him the key and inform him that a month has been paid for. He can move it or allow the self-storage people auction it off in a month. Change your locks so that he just doesn't let himself back in and call the police if they do break in."}
{"question":"I'm afraid that maybe they have the wrong address or something. If they try to send me a notification for jury duty and it goes to the wrong address, can I get in trouble?\n\nAlso, I think jury duty will be kind of fun. Can I volunteer?\n","answer":" If your address is correct on public documents(taxes, deeds, registrations, driver's license, et cetera) then you have nothing to worry about.\n\nIf you don't get called, it's just pure luck.  My wife hasn't been called once in 22 years, I've been called twice in five.  And I'm likely *never* to serve, so it's a bit aggravating."}
{"question":"We lost our child while traveling on an international flight from Toronto to Delhi. The child was about 6 months old. He collapsed, and died about 1 hour before the flight landed.\n\nAn autopsy report indicated that cause of death was 'asphyxiation.' The airline said they did a curtsy investigation and did not take any responsibility for the incident. Even their letter on the matter was full of factual errors. My wife and I moved on. However, I wonder if I can still file a case\/writ to:\n\na) Hold the Airline legally accountable\n\nb) Claim compensation for Emotional Harm and Mental Suffering\n\nThe incident happened in June 2008. Is there a statute of limitations ?\n","answer":" Sorry for your loss, but the real question here is how do you think the airline asphyxiated your child?Answer #2: I am terribly sorry for you loss. \n\nIt is highly doubtful there is a theory in which you have not exceeded the statute of limitations to bring a suit. What is more important to consider is if you would have had strong evidence thr airline caused the asphyxiation. The word means loss of breath; how was this due to the airline's negligence? \n\nIf the child had a medical emergency, anyone on the flight who responded would have been a passenger volunteer. Airlines do not keep medical personnel on flights in part to *avoid* this type of liability, but there are ground physicians who give orders and assume medical liability for acts of people who have medical qualification to intervene. They are not airline employees, either. \n\nYou should always speak with an attorney about all relevant facts to be sure, but I suspect this might not be viable to pursue. \n\nAgain, you have my depends condolences.  Answer #3: A claim in Ontario would have had to have been filed within two years of the date the claim arose (Limitations Act 2002, SO 2002, section 4). I expect any claim in Delhi will have the same issue. In short: _even if you have a viable claim_, you've almost certainly waited too long.\n\nSpeak to an attorney to be sure, but I am not optimistic."}

They told me I would get my $200 bond back in the mail in about a month. They said I didn't have to appear at the future bond\/court date that they invented out of thin fucking air at the jail last night.\n\nShould I talk to a lawyer? I had to miss work today and I'm still being a crybaby about having to walk 6 miles down a dark highway in 32° weather with no coat to get to my car. I was arrested in a random ass town halfway between my mom's and my home, which is over a 2 hour drive. I had no one to come get me. They took all my money so I couldn't get a cab. They told me my car was 3 miles down the road, but it ended up being 6.\n\nIs there anything at all I can do?\n\n**Another update [6:50pm cst]** -- CASENET, which is Missouri's online court website that lets you look up court cases, shows that I plead guilty *today*. No, I plead guilty when I went in and paid many months ago. They are making it look like I plead guilty today and I don't know what their angle is.\n","answer":" Would it make you feel better if I said that I'm glad you're ok and I'm glad you were able to work it out? Answer #2: Outside of the missing work I don't think you really have tangible damages, so the only real angle would be the work bit. How much that could really be played on is another story that I can't answer for (NAL).Answer #3: Next time post something on your local Reddit sub and someone will give you a ride.  I would totally drive at least an hour to pick someone up and take them home.  You could have ordered Dominos and had the driver take you to your car while eating pizza.  (Always have a hidden $20 in your car)Answer #4: Not worth it. At this point, you have been made whole.Answer #5: Make more friends? If we were buds I would have went and got you. "}
