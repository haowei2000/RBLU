{"question":"I gave my friend 180 litecoin to invest ($10,000 right now) because he had a “hedge fund”. He claimed to have a series 7 and that he could triple my money. Now I want my money back and he said he sent it to the wrong address, and he won’t show me any proof that it sent. I don’t know who to go to or what to do. Do I go to the police or FBI? Is it worth it to sue? Was a crime even committed?\n","answer":" Yea sue Answer #2: Scam is always a crime. Do you have any kind of evidence? A proof that you gave him this money? A written evidence that he would make you earn money with your investment?"}
{"question":"Boyfriend received a \"general discharge\" after 4 years from the army for what they deemed as a \"pre-existing condition\" (crohns disease). He had never been diagnosed or evaluated for crohns disease before the army. He now receives no benefits because of his discharge and they are requiring he pay back half of his student loans ($40,000), which he only has because they requested he get a degree to become an officer. Is there any way he can fight any of this? Mainly the student loans.\n","answer":" Former Naval officer here. \n\nThe general discharge seems right. If he did not know he had crohns, he does not meet the criteria for fraudulent enlistment. Nor is he qualified for an honorable due to medical conditions as the disease is not due to military service. Honestly, you are lucky they are willing to pay half the student loans instead of sticking them all on you. Nothing can be done if something was improper, other than appeal it through the VA. I'm guessing the reason the loans came into effect because he was the Army equivalent of STA21, and didn't finish the contract. "}
{"question":"I literally just got off a plane and went to pick up some drunk friends with my rental car. I parked on the side in a red zone with my blinkers on and got out the car to get my friends to help them in bc they were drunk.

I explain the situation and he still writes me up a traffic ticket for blocking the road, which I wasn't even doing. \n\nThe penalty is a whopping $160... which is completely stupid. I don't have time to fight it since I leave in a few days. What would happen if I just leave this alone? I live in PA \n","answer":" Having your blinkers on does not allow you to park where you aren't allowed. "}
{"question":"They gave me schizophrenia medication and seizure medication and salt water IV which is all strictly against my diet and lifestyle. I gave no consent. I was having a bad acid trip but i wasn’t aggressive but they forced medicine on me that negatively impacted me greatly\n","answer":" I love that you think a salt water IV is against your diet, but LSD is not. \n\nThe answer to your question is no.Answer #2: You want to sue medical professionals for taking steps to keep you alive when you incapacitated yourself with drugs?Answer #3: When you are unconscious, your consent is implied.  In case it's your next question... Yes, you are also responsible for the medical treatment bill.Answer #4: Medical Malpractice, which is what you are claiming, is very fact specific and you need to speak with a MedMal lawyer.\n\nThat being said, based on your post and your incapacitation, it does not sound like the clinic did anything objectively or reasonably wrong."}
{"question":"I met a girl on a dating app, app said shes 18 but she mentioned she's 17, I'm 22. Every google search says age of consent is 16, she turns 18 soon, I just can't help but feel like I'm going to get arrested. Am I 100% in my legal rights to meet up with her, and see what happens? I don't want my life ruined, but she's hot, and who the fuck made it that she can't be a day under 18 for it to be moral?\n","answer":" The law's not necessarily about what's moral. It's about what you will or won't be penalized for doing. Since there has to be a line somewhere (there's plenty of evidence that sexual relationships with kids are sufficiently bad for their development to be worth banning), the line's going to be a bit arbitrary.\n\nMany states do have a \"close in age\" exception to age of consent laws, to make the line _less_ arbitrary and to deal with the reality that teenagers will have sex with each other and probably shouldn't go to jail for it. New Jersey has such an exception, provided you're within four years of your partner: it doesn't apply to you, since you're more than four years older.\n\nThe age of consent in New Jersey is 16. If she's not lying to you the way she lied to the site, she can legally consent to sexual contact with you. However, your paramour is a minor: if her parents tell you to stay away from her, stay away from her.Answer #2: Life advice...don't do it.  There is probably a world of maturity difference between you two.  You are in completely different places in your life.  "}
{"question":"I was talking to a friend about the the Brock Turner case and how the judge recently got...I don't know what to call it...recalled? Well, my position was that even even though the judge made some very questionable comments to say the least, his hands were kinda tied. Because he was sentenced to 6 months which, as I understand it, by definition means it's a misdemeanor right? So the prosecutor pursued this as a misdemeanor and not a felony. Could the judge have said no that's too light? Or we're his hands tied?\n","answer":" The prosecutor decides which charges to bring agsinst the accused and the judge decides on if the accused is guilty and on the sentence.\n\nIf someone is charged and tried for murder, the judge cannot change the charge to manslaughter for example."}
{"question":"PA - Long legal battle. Every attempt at me ultimately just takes away from my kids and our time together. Not sure what to do besides remove myself from the equation then they can’t be used as pawns anymore. Or hear me crying. Ncp isn’t actually what’s best for them but maybe if I’m not there that will change. Assuming ncp will just file for emergency custody after a few days if I remain missing and after six months they’ll move to terminate my parental rights. Are there any other legal consequences of doing it this way? Child abandonment charges or warrants for not following the order?\n","answer":" You should speak with a therapist and a lawyer who can help you find the remedies here that don’t involve giving up time with your children. \n\nBut to answer your question more directly, the non-custodial parent could seek substantive changes in the orders, especially around child support payments. But probably could not terminate parental rights. "}
{"question":"This isn't about anything *specific*, I'm just curious how this works. Can you agree to a search, but a partial search? Like say the cops want to search your house (without a warrant) can you say yes to every room except *this* room? Or something similar? Or same with your car. You can look everywhere but don't tear up my seats? Don't look in the glove?\n\nI'll likely never have to deal with this because I would never allow a search without a warrant, I'm just curious how that works. It seems like since it's voluntary you should be able to have stipulations. \n","answer":" You can do this and you can revoke your consent at anytime. There is a danger to this, which is why it is always better to decline a voluntary search. If a cop is searching your car voluntarily and he is about to open the glove box at which point you start screaming \"I revoke my consent!\" you might have just given him probable cause by your reaction."}
{"question":"Milwaukee, Wi. I’ve been parking in a parking garage for 2 years downtown. I’ve been reversing into parking spaces the entire 2 years. Recently I had an “official” note placed on my windshield stating that I’m not allowed to back into the spaces. The contract on the back of the parking voucher in part reads “only a license is granted hereby and no bailment is created”. I’m not sure what that means or if it’s relevant but nothing else in the contract applies to this situation. Multiple vehicles reverse into parking spaces in the garage everyday and I’ve never seen another note left on a vehicle. I’m assuming the garage can do whatever they want. \n","answer":" Are the spaces straight or diagonal?   If the lanes are one way and you are backing into a diagonal space, you would end up pulling out against traffic.\n\nDid you have to register for access to the garage or is it one where you receive a ticket upon entrance?   It could be that they want to see your license plate and backing in requires them to get out of their vehicle and actually walk around to see it.\n\nAt the end of the day though, yeah, the garage can probably make and enforce any rules they want within reason.Answer #2: I wish my garage would institute a no back-in. I’m sure you’re perfectly good at maneuverability, but I constantly get held up in the morning by people backing in. Also, when I’m backing out to leave and you’re pulling forward to leave, I don’t have a clear visual cue that you’re moving. It drives me nuts. \n"}

Him and his girlfriend were drunk or asleep when it happened. They both live there with him. The cops found his still and some other jars of his homemade alcohol on the property. In South Carolina under the law what is likely to happen to my friend?\n","answer":" Lets be honest, it takes quite some alcohol to end up in the hospital, and kids that age are not prone to drinking that amount of nasty burning. Not saying it isnt possible, just saying the level of belief is low and cps will be suspicious. Get a lawyer ASAP."}
{"question":"So my friend is the dad, they have two kids, 7 and 4, and have been living together for about that long. I have looked into what constitutes common law marriage in Texas, and they meet the requirements other than getting it recognized by a court. And i read that they still have time to get it recognized (so they can get an official divorce) and what not.\n\nI'm worried that if for some reason they aren't able to get their common law marriage recognized, or that if the cheating 'wife' doesn't cooperate with him, would the dad be able to get much from the break up. \n\nI apologize if this is all over the place, but basically, the mom has been a terrible mom over the past year. Lately she's been gone at night, caught in lies, yelling at her kids that she's not coming back, and other things that would make a divorce case go in the dad's favor. \n\nBut what if he can't get to that point because she doesn't cooperate or even because of financial reasons between the two?\n","answer":" If he wants custody, he can file for custody. No divorce needed unless assets need to be divied up."}
{"question":"The guy hit my parents vehicle and ran off. The police found him and he admitted to doing it, his boss came and said the insurance company would basically pay whatever we wanted. The guy who hit my parents didn’t have a license either. I just don’t know where to go from here. My daughter isn’t hurt, but I want to sue for emotional damage as she doesn’t even want to go near her grandparents now. I also want to sue whoever gave him a car to drive, knowing he didn’t have a license. Do I have a case here?\n","answer":" &gt;My daughter isn’t hurt, but I want to sue for emotional damage as she doesn’t even want to go near her grandparents now.\n\nYou might as well not even entertain that road of thought. You aren't going to get very far basing a personal injury suit on emotional damages.Answer #2: Their insurance will pay for damages.\n\nThat includes damages to your vehicle and medical bills. Suing for emotional trauma isn't really a thing unless you legit go seek therapy due to said accident, then those bills may be covered.Answer #3: You aren’t going to get money just because, there needs to be something diagnosably wrong and actual money spent as a consequence.\n\nGo get your daughter examined by the pediatrician if she hasn’t been already. If they find something wrong, follow up with specialists. If therapy is necessary (it probably isn’t, but it’s possible), go do that. Replace the car seat. Those are the things you can get compensated for.Answer #4: NAL- same thing happened when my 3 y\/o kids were in the car with my mom and got rear ended. One kid went to urgent care right away. No major injuries other than some soft tissue bruising. Other kid did not go to doc at all. The one with the injury got $1500, the one without got $500 and they reimbursed the car seats immediately. So, she will likely get something but not much. Negotiate with their initial offer.  Also, make sure you immediately replace the car seat. They will reimburse you for that no questions asked. She should never sit in the seat again that was in the car during the crash."}

{"question":"So my mom found nudes on my phone of my girlfriend. She turned us in. That’s already about to be handled, I’m meeting with a probation officer to discuss if this goes to court or not. But my mom hates her and her family and is mad that her parents let us date knowing my parents didn’t. We’re both girls I’m 17 and she’s 15. My mom thought she was too young to date. And my dad is just homophonic. But after this whole case with the nudes is through, my parents want a restraining order on her and her family so they can’t contact me or see me etc. Can they actually do this if my girlfriend never harmed me, mentally or physically? My mom just hates her family and doesn’t want us having contact ever again.\n","answer":" Until you're 18 your parents can restrict you from contacting her even without a court order.Answer #2: It is very likely that a court will order you not to see each other given that you have exchanged the images. Your parents can just ask the court to make it part of any order and even if the judge was not planning on it. This is simply the reality of the situation in which you find yourself. Once you are 18, you will probably be able to see each other again, unless the court order goes on longer. Given you are both underage, you just don’t have much say. That is the way the legal system works for minors. Especially minors who have exchanged such images."}

{"question":"Hello r\/legaladvice I'm a recent college grad working an unpaid internship at a recording studio where they make us clean  and sweep and paint constantly. I think it's illegal. We are supposed to have one learning day a week and one cleaning day a week, but often the learning days are ignored. \n\nIs it legal for them to make us clean all day? I twisted my ankle painting ceilings for this place. It feels wrong. Any advice would help.\n\nLocation: Massachusetts \n","answer":" Massachusetts has stricter standards for unpaid internships than the federal ones. Under federal law, unpaid internships can be offered by for profit companies as long as they meet 6 standards that ensure the benefits of the internship go to the intern and not the company. However, in Mass. only a charity, or educational or religious institute can offer an unpaid internship. So right off the bat if this recording studio is not one of those you need to be paid min wage.Answer #2: That wouldn't be legal even if you got one learning day and one cleaning day.

My step son (who is 8) is already having emotional issues because she didn't even show for her weekend last time and was also left alone by his cousin for half an hour and now has abandonment issues at home with husband and I. \n","answer":" You cannot just ignore the custody order regardless of child support. If she has a warrant and you know where she will be at drop off you could tip off the police, they may or may not care to arrest her. Answer #2: You can't ignore the custody order. Of course, you can tip the police off. The may even do something about it. Your strategy will depend on how you handoff the child to her, and the exact wording of your order.\n\nYou can petition the court for a change in custody. Not paying child support doesn't directly impact custody, but being incarcerated for failing to pay it might. Get a lawyer.\n\nBesides the legal advice, your husband needs to get his son into therapy. Abandonment can leave lifelong impact on a child's mental health.Answer #3: follow custody order and do what your lawyer says is best advice, but if it really is having an impact on the child its reasonable to not put him through that. but you need support because your husband will be in contempt. parental alienation is a real thing but if school psychologist or gal can back it up (ie grades slipping\/etc) you could maybe get supervised visitation where visitation is structured and observed and reports made to court "}

My idea for an excellent way to give back (and to get my practice's name out there in a positive light) to have my whole (future) team of hygienists, assistants, and office managers (and myself of course) colunteer at our local disaster relief logistics company one night a week (with team shirts for PR!)\n\nSo my question is, can I offer employees a signing bonus with the stipulation being they have to volunteer with us if they accept it?  (One night a week, 2-3 hours)  Or is that basically forcing them to volunteer, which I'm guessing would be pretty illegal?  \n\n\n","answer":" One night a week? Are you insane? One night a month is pushing it. Nobody wants to give up 1\/7th of their evenings for work stuff. *Maybe* one Saturday or Sunday afternoon a quarter. It's great you want to volunteer, but for most people their job is just their job.Answer #2: Passion for community service is great. \n\nAnyone with a pulse can work at the \"disaster relief logistics\" place. However you will be a licensed dentist with a dental facility, so an evening per week there would be a waste. \n\nDental care is tremendously underserved in the US. \n\nFind an organization local to your practice that helps those in need. Offer to provide dental care to their clients. Restrict the offer to some number of hours or maybe 2-3 patients per week. \n\nThis would be much more valuable than anything else your office could do. And it is directly helping someone rather than filling boxes. \n\nAnswer #3: If you are insisting that employees do certain work as a condition of employment, you are going to need to pay them at least minimum wage for those hours, obey overtime laws, etc."}
{"question":"I live with 5 other people in a house in LA and we've been renting month-to-month for the past year.  At the end of the month, 4 of the current roommates will be moving out to be replaced by 4 new tenants. Today the landlord contacted us and said he will be raising the monthly rent from $4200 to $5200 per month.\n\nIs he allowed to do this?  Is it considered a new lease since new tenants are moving in? \nTopic:\nReal Estate law\n","answer":" In CA, landlords must give 60 days notice of a rent increase of more than 10% (30 days if less than 10%)."}

{"question":"Last year I paid $6100 for foundation work on my house. In my contract it said I have a lifetime transferable warranty. To transfer the waranty, its $100 but otherwise no other cost.\n\nI currently need warranty service but now they say I need to $75 per visit because of a new policy. I think this should only apply to customers who sign new contracts where this is in the contract. Am I right??\n\n","answer":" If you have the warranty in writing and it says that there is no charge for a visit, then you're right.  If it says something different you may not be right.  What do you have and what does it say?"}
{"question":"I am writing this on behalf of my roommate.  \n\n\nWhen my ex-boyfriend was my boyfriend I bought him a truck in my name under the condition that he make the payments and pay the insurance. He has gone MIA no payments in months, has multiple tickets, and has the police looking for him. I am told that if he gets in an accident or kills someone I am liable, I am also told that since it is insured in his name I cannot report it stolen. Do I have any recourse?\n","answer":" If he gets into an accident you defintely can be held liable *unless* you report it as stolen. Since you own it you can report it stolen. Who's insuring it is irrelevant there. Actually if he's insuring it by himself he's committing insurance fraud (you cant legally insure something you don't own) which is a felony."}
{"question":"What will happen? I've been so scared of it for so long that I've never even looked into it. I have essentially a confession from my father in email form.

I'm in Ontario, Canada.\n","answer":" How old are you? If you're still in school, go to the counselor - they're mandated reporters, will be familiar with the process, and can get you help dealing with it.Answer #2: Regardless of age call kids help phone, they'll take care of everything from there or at least give you advice on how to go about it "}
{"question":"I am conducting a real estate transaction, and the buyer's agent has sent me a signed agreement. The only caveat is that each page of the agreement is an individual PDF file. Am I able to combine the files and consider the agreement binding? Do I need to request the buyer's agent to combine the files into one?\n\nEdit: this is in Georgia\n","answer":" I would request the buyer's agent combine the files. That way you can't be accused of changing the content of the document (even if you didn't)."}
{"question":"I moved late into on campus accommodation. I've lived their for 2 years in the past, and they used to take a payment automatically from my account\/notify me if I didn't have enough to pay. But this year since I moved late I think I may have been a glitch in the system. I've been living here since March and haven't paid a penny over my deposit but haven't been reminded to pay through any form of communication. I'm moving out in June, when my tenancy expires will I still be legally accountable? Thanks!\n","answer":" IANAL and know nothing about UK law.\n\nYou should be prepared that they might figure this out at any time and demand immediate payment. In the US you would still owe this money and I'd be very surprised if that was not also true in the UK. You would be wise to set aside the rent each month in an account you do not touch. In the US they would be able to pursue payment of your debt for several years after the fact."}

Would this shirt be appropriate for a female to wear to court?\n\nhttp:\/\/www.kohls.com\/product\/prd-1151180\/dickies-performance-twill-work-shirt-womens.jsp\n","answer":" I personally recommend a business professional look.\n\nWhen I've been in court and on the stand it was button down professional shirt and dress pants and shoes.\n\nThat shirt is too casual in my opinion. It is a dickies work shirt.\n\n\nAppearance matters a lot."}
{"question":"I signed the lease, paid the deposit, and was notified by email (welcome letter) that the apartment was mine and all the paperwork was accepted. Fast forward a month and I get a call informing me that the current resident has decided to stay and the apartment was no longer available. They offered me alternative apartments with a cash incentive. I declined, stating I wanted to proceed with the current contract I signed. The complex said this was not an option.  I would like the apartment I signed the lease for, the other apartments they offered are not as desirable. My current lease runs out at the end of the year and it would be difficult to find a comparable apartment to the one I wanted in that time frame. They have offered to refund my deposit and application fee. What are my options?\n","answer":" You can sue them for breach if you can show damages but do you have any?  It sounds like they are acting reasonably and they likey signed the lease in good faith. You can either accept the alternative unit or get all your money back. Answer #2: OP- It's likely your rental contract with the landlord has a clause for just this situation (where the existing tenant reverses the notice they gave) that dissolves the lease (takes the liability off your landlord).\n\nYou should take back the deposit back and\/or ask for a bigger concession on the other unit(s) they're offering you."}
{"question":"I made a joke on my Instagram bio saying “I’m a school shooter running from the fbi” and a girl at school reported it to the principal I haven’t been questioned yet but still if he does what should I do? Will I go to jail I’m 12 so I obviously wasn’t being serious. Is this free speech or a threat.\n","answer":" I think this would be a good lesson for you to learn what is, and is not, actually funny. You're not going to go to jail but I would expect some questioning.Answer #2: You're being accused of being a school shooter...\n\n**because you said you were**.\n\n\"I was totally just kidding\" is not a great defense.Answer #3: “I’m 12 so I obviously wasn’t being serious” that’s not really how crimes work. Also, I’m glad that girl reported you, she knows what’s up. \n\nYou’ll probably do an evaluation and the school will likely give you a hard time. Hope you’ve learned from this."}

{"question":"Some background info, my wife has Grave's Disease. It is a hyperthyroid condition that shows up around 18. Her specialist did radioactive iodine treatments and killed about 90% of it. This caused her to have to take sinthroid to replace the missing thyroid hormone. (I'm no doctor, this is just what I was told.) She is now 38 and has been on sinthroid for years. Her current doctor has been managing her sinthroid levels for years. The normal range is 6-12. If it's below 6, then he raises her meds. When we actually looked up the labs for the past 4 years, we noticed that her thyroid level was 78! The only reason we thought to check was because a new nurse practitioner called us in a panic to tell her to stop the medicine. I'm thinking that I should talk to a lawyer, and I probably will regardless. I just wanted to post here to see if that's the best recourse. Thanks!\n","answer":" Are we talking T4 values here?  If so, I would be downright shocked if your endo didn't notice that the lab values were 5x higher than they should be for years.  Here's what probably happened.  The labs usually report T4 values using a 5-12 range in ug\/dl.  However, because people like to be difficult, some labs report their values using ng\/ml.  Why is this important?  Because a 78 ng\/ml reading is actually a \"normal\" 7.8 in ug\/dl.\n\nSo go personally get a copy of the blood test results and see what reference range units they use.  \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a doctor or any other kind of medical professional.Answer #2: Talk to a lawyer. An issue like this is way to complicated for anyone to be able to give you any meaningful advice without both specialist knowledge and a full appreciation of your individual circumstances.\n\nMost medical malpractice lawyers will give you an initial consultation for free to decide if you have a case worth pursuing."}
{"question":"I wanted to do a cosplay of a character from the game “We Happy Few” and I wanted to create my own edible “Joy pills”. So I wanted to know if I would be breaking any laws but doing so. Now I don’t plan on filling them with drugs, it’ll most likely be sugar, so they have some weight to them. Yet in the end I really just wanted to know if I could do that.\n","answer":" If they contain zero pharmaceuticals and you make no attempt to sell or pass them off as legitimate medicine, you should be fine from a legal standpoint.  Personally, it'd be a good idea to make them oversized or something so its even more obvious that they aren't real.\n\nI would however contact the venue (I presume the cosplay is for a con?) and just check with them beforehand that it's ok to bring them, because I wouldn't put it past security to confiscate something like that.Answer #2: You could just use vitamins if you're lazy."}
{"question":"I'm in Ontario, Canada. The fire alarm for my building (6 floors, ~8 units per floor) is inaudible from inside my apartment as it is on the far end of the hallway. I contacted the building manager, they said they aren't gonna do anything. I contacted my city's fire department safety inspector and he keeps blowing me off and not returning calls. My provincial fire code specifically says \"alarm signalling devices shall be located so that the alarm signal and alert signal when sounded, may be heard throughout the building over all normal sounds at any time.\" What are the legal options I have to push forward with this? I want to have some weight to throw around to convince the fire department to remedy the situation, I don't care about getting money in a lawsuit or getting people in trouble I really just want to be able to hear the damn fire alarm. Any help would be much appreciated.\n","answer":" Talk to the city councillor for your ward, then. The fire department ultimately reports to council, and your councillor may pick this up as a bit of easy constituent outreach.\n\n\"I called my fire marshal with a fire safety concern at my apartment, and they never even returned my calls\" might do it."}
{"question":"My friend's doctor perscribed her the medicines Lexapro and Trazodone. Even a simple google search would reveal that the two drugs are known to interact badly. Unfortunately, her parents did not check this and my friend ended up in the hospital for serotonin syndrome, which is exactly what Lexapro and Trazodone can result in. Can the doctor face any legal repercussions? Is there any way to sue the doctor for the money for the hospital bills?  \n\n\n(This is in Arizona)\nTopic:\nMedicine and Malpractice\n","answer":" Actually I thinking you are overstating the interaction issue. Yes they can, but it’s rare. And you need to understand that each of these drugs have the potential for fairly severe side effects if prescribed on their own (as do most drugs to be honest).\n\nBut med mal is very fact based and a specialist area. Most med mal attorneys will offer a free consult, so that’s what you should probably do. Be aware, I suspect that this is not going to go anywhere - the reason you have found anecdotal stories about this interaction is a function of the fact that in some circumstances this is a good mix for patients. In other words, it’s acceptable prescribing practices. So by all means consult an attorney but don’t get your hopes up.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who ended up with mild serotonin syndrome just taking one antidepressant and I know how miserable and ill I was. So  I do feel for your friend. I just don’t think this rises to the level of malpractice."}
{"question":"So, I live in the US. Georgia.\nMe and a friend were joking around, and I showed him a picture with a caption saying, \"Take your friend's phone, change your name to 'Brandy from the club', and call him at 3 in the morning and then hang up.\". I jokingly told him to do that to one of our friends, and he said it'd get him killed. Then the question rose in my head, wouldn't that be involuntary manslaughter? \n\nEdit: I meant, wouldn't he be associated and it technically be involuntary manslaughter on his end for doing so.\n\nI just want to get my head around this, since we've been in a back and forth regarding it.\n","answer":" This is a general answer. It's going to vary in minutia from state to state. It's generally when you accidentally kill someone through gross negligence, but you didn't mean to kill them. For example, you're drunk and start shooting homemade fireworks at your neighbor's garage as a prank. The garage catches on fire and your neighbor dies in the fire. Or your friend asks you to inject them with heroin because they're too afraid to do it themselves. You oblige, but accidentally shoot the up with too much and they die.\n\nIn your situation, your friend would not have any culpability. The person who did the killing would be charged with murder. Answer #2: It's when you oops and it results in someone's death. "}
{"question":"Was issued a warrant in Alabama for not finishing paying off a driving with a suspended license ticket. The thing is I live 3,000 miles away in Washington State and every one I called from the city said the only way to get it resolved is to come in and see the judge. Well I explained my situation and asked if I could do it over the phone, seeing as how it would cost 700 or more to even get to Alabama in the first place. She said no. I also asked if there was an email I could send to the judge explaining the situation, she then started to get mad. So I asked for the judges name and the address to reach him at for the city to send a letter and she at that point, angrily, gave me a name and an address of what she said was the judge but was actually the county attorney that only gives legal advice to county and city officials. I don't know what to do now and any help would be very much appreciated.\n","answer":" &gt;  I don't know what to do now\n\nYou should hire you an attorney to help you navigate this.

{"question":"Location: Texas \nMy grandmother has recently been put in the hospital due to poor physical health. Prior to her being put in the hospital, my brother and I took care of her. My brother lived almost full time with her catering to all of her needs. He balanced her check book, paid her bills, took her to doctors appointments etc. You name it, he did it. Since she has been in the hospital, power of attorney has been given to my uncle. He has been siphoning money out of her account at his leisure and my brother called him on it, so my uncle told the assisted care place she is currently at that he wasn’t allowed to see her. Is he within his rights to do so? I visited my grandmother today and she said that she wanted to see my brother, but felt powerless to my uncle because he has POA. My uncle can have the money. I genuinely don’t care. I just want my brother to be able to see my grandmother. \n","answer":" Your grand mother needs to meet with a lawyer ASAP and cancel the POA.  As long as she is of sound mind she can do so.\n\nSomeone with a POA gets to control decisions on behalf of someone who is unable to make decisions.

{"question":"Looking for advice for Colorado Divorce cases... I have googled to no avail. \n\nHere is the shortened situation. Husband and Wife have been separated for almost 6 years and now would like to file and get a formal divorce. During their marriage, they had two children who are now school aged. For the last 4 years wife has had no contact with the children per her own choice, the door has always been opened on husbands side. \n\nNow that they would like a divorce she would like to file without including the children. She doesn't want to get hit with child support, and she would like the current parenting plan to stay as is. Obviously, this is not ideal for the Father as he would not have finalized custody papers, however, for the sake of this discussion, let's focus on just the filing without the kids. \n\nI was under the assumption that you had to include the children in the divorce process, but I am unsure if that is really the law. Any thoughts?\n","answer":" A petition for divorce must indicate all living children from the marriage. That doesn't necessarily mean the mother will pay child support."}

I kill that person. Can I be tried again for their murder ?\n","answer":" Yes, you can be tried again.  \n\n\nKilling Seymour Butz on June 11th in Central Park is a different crime than killing Seymour Butz on August 15th in the Grand Canyon. The double jeopardy clause protects against successive trials for the same crime, not for two different crimes.  \n\n\nAnd a moment's thought would make this clear.  \n\n\nSuppose the crime was robbery. If you steal Seymour Butz's wallet on June 11th in Central Park, do you imagine that you're immune from a robbery charge when you steal his wallet  on August 15th in the Grand Canyon?Answer #2: Nothing would prevent you from being charged for killing the person after your release.  An erroneous conviction and sentence do not negate responsibility for actual crimes subsequently committed even in the event of it being the same basic criminal act you were previously convicted for in error."}

{"question":"I'm a 20 year old college student and I'm in a weird situation.  There's a company I used to work for and things weren't working out.

The document was about 18 pages long.  Where I worked for them was in ME but their office is in MA.\n","answer":" There is no magic to labeling something an \"agreement\" rather than a \"contract.\"  If it meets the requirements for a contract, it is one.  The fact that it is 18 pages long tells me it was probably drafted by someone who knows what they are doing.

{"question":"Location: NY\n\nIn school a few days ago, a kid picked up my backpack, asked if anything valuable was in it, and when I told him my laptop was in it he dropped it on the ground. When I got home I discovered the laptop was smashed. I went to the school who won't do anything because nobody saw it and the maggot is denying he did it. I am so disgusted right now. NINE people were asked about it and they all said they didn't see anything. One kid told the school that he heard a thump and saw the bag in front of the maggot withcme yelling at him. The school won't do anything with that information. If I file a small claims lawsuit, is there even a chance of winning? Is it up to the judge?\n","answer":" How old are you?  Depending on your age you may not be able to file anything legal by yourself.\n\nWith no credible witnesses and what seems like a \"he said he said\" situation, you will have a difficult time proving your case.  You can certainly try though.\n\nEdit- also, why did you not check your laptop there on scene?  Finding the damage after you get home is going to be another hurdle to prove that the damage was caused by the dropping of the bag.Answer #2: [You've already posted this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/3sprvu\/kid_at_my_school_purposely_broke_my_laptop_what\/) and the advice remains the same. You didn't take the time to inspect the laptop after he dropped the bag for 2 whole hours, without any witnesses or camera footage backing up your claim, there's nothing here but a really expensive life lesson. It sucks and I imagine your parents are breathing down your neck over a $1,300 laptop but in the future you'll  have the presence of mind to inspect for damages sooner rather than later.Answer #3: yes, it would be up to the judge. do you have any kind of insurance? they might cover this. you can also give them the kid's name. you should also file a police report."}

{"question":"I'm in a real pickle here. I recently moved into a garage unit, I have a lot of stuff (tables and furniture, as well as workshop equipment. I really enjoy living in my workshop and would like it to continue that way. My landlord recently found out it's \"illegal\" to live in the garage unit. She has this decided to move me into another room, one which my items will NEVER fit in, as well as I can not get work done. I have a six month lease signed with her. Naturally I am looking for a new place but chances are I won't be able to find one in time. I get that she might get subjected to fines, but I paid to live here and this is extremely stressful and time wasting for me. Obviously this breaks our rental agreement.\n\nIs there any way I can stay in the garage? What is the legal definition of habitation? Like for example, can I be in the garage most of the time but not sleep there? Can I just say \"tough titties\" to the landlord and force them to give me a 30-day at the worst?\n","answer":" It's your landlord's fault\/issue that she rented you a space she shouldn't have. My suggestion would be to negotiate with the landlord and allow you to rent a bedroom *and* keep the garage as your workshop until the end of the lease.Answer #2: &gt; Is there any way I can stay in the garage? \n\nIf it's not zoned for residential use or up to code (it's almost assuredly not), then no.  She's in breach of lease and you can negotiate an exit or an alternate arrangement, but you can't force her to let you live somewhere illegally.  \n\n&gt; Can I just say \"tough titties\" to the landlord and force them to give me a 30-day at the worst?\n\nIt wouldn't be a 30 day, it would be an eviction.

{"question":"Hello,\nBecause of a lot of financial mistakes many years ago I have both old tax debt and defaulted student loans. I am current on my tax filings but still owe taxes from 2006. But My bigger concern is the DEFAULTED student loans. They have been going from collection company to collection company.\nIs it possible to file bankruptcy out of this mess and get a fresh start? It is nearly impossible for me to pay back the student loans in the amounts they want. The student loans are from 1984-1990. I'm in Minnesota and I'm turning 49 this year.\n","answer":" Student loans are almost rarely dischargeable in bk and it has to be a chapter 7. You can meet with a bankruptcy attorney to see if it's right for you.  The general advice would be \"don't count on it\" when it comes to your defaulted loans.  One of the big reasons it's relatively easy to get student loans and the interest rates are low is because they are almost never dischargeable. Answer #2: &gt; Discharge in Bankruptcy\n\n&gt; This is not an automatic process—you must prove to the bankruptcy court that repaying your student loan would cause undue hardship.\n\n&gt; If you file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may have your loan discharged in bankruptcy only if the bankruptcy court finds that repayment would impose undue hardship on you and your dependents. This must be decided in an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court. Your creditors may be present to challenge the request. The court uses this three-part test to determine hardship:\n\n&gt; * If you are forced to repay the loan, you would not be able to maintain a minimal standard of living.\n\n&gt; * There is evidence that this hardship will continue for a significant portion of the loan repayment period.\n\n&gt; * You made good-faith efforts to repay the loan before filing bankruptcy (usually this means you have been in repayment for a minimum of five years).\n\n&gt; **Your loan will not be discharged if you are unable to satisfy any one of the three requirements.**\n\n&gt; If your loan is discharged, you will not have to repay any portion of your loan, and all collection activity will stop. You also will regain eligibility for federal student aid if you had previously lost it."}

{"question":"According to society’s views on responsibility whilst drunk anyone who has sex with you after you’ve had beer is a rapist and we would all agree that if a 16 year old forced an adult to have sex it would be rape, so by that logic if a minor has sex with a drunk adult it would be rape, but having sex with a minor is also rape and obviously raping a sober person while your drunk is still considered rape, so that would make the adult also a rapist.

{"question":" \n\nI  just wondered what i'm legally allowed to do if I'm out walking in the  park and a person randomly kicks my dog or another dog comes out of no  where and starts attacking my dog?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n","answer":" As another commenter has said, pets will be considered personal property. \n\nA person has a right to protect their personal property so long as it is reasonable.  \n\nSo it will depend on the situation.  \n\nFor example, if you’re walking your dog and then another dog comes and attacks your dog and you kick that dog in the face... this would be reasonable if it was a large dog.  However, let’s say the attacking dog was a chihuahua, kicking that dog in the face might not be reasonable, because you could have pulled your dog away or possibly shove the chihuahua with your foot. \n\nSo it’ll depend on what most people would do in the situation.  Answer #2: I'm not too sure but since dogs are considered their owners' property, you would treat it like you would treat the protection of your house?? I'm not sure, just spectating Answer #3: One clarification to make here is that you have the right to defend your dog DURING or to prevent the attack once attempts to attack have been made. NOT AFTER. So if someone comes up and kicks your dog, unless there's an indication they're about to have another go at another kick, you cannot use self-defense if that threat is no longer there. Answer #4: Oddly, I was contemplating a similar scenario recently.\n\nSuppose I am publicly walking my, let's say a pitbull, past a home. The owner of that home comes out with a gun, telling about how these killer dogs shouldn't be in this neighborhood and he appears as though he is about to shoot my dog. I am also armed.

Also, there is no way for us to know if the store should have done more.  Maybe the slippery condition existed for 30 seconds and someone had not yet noticed it.  Nobody here knows.  That is one of the things that a lawyer would help figure out.  It also may not matter, depending on the state's tort laws.  Talk to a lawyer.\n\n"}
{"question":"I recently had a friend who bought an iPhone 8 they ran a imei check on it. Everything came back clean and good. A few weeks later they get a notification saying that their SIM card no longer worked. Look at the imei again and it has a assurion claim on it. Is this a common practice and are there any laws to help prevent this?

{"question":"This employee was just reinstated after a 6 month investigation and home work assignment for telling multiple people he was going to shoot and kill a co-worker at work. A separation order was put in place between the 2 employees, however the perpetrator has a history of work place violence and pulling a gun in a road rage incident. I don't feel safe. What do I do?\n","answer":" Why haven’t you called the police. This is what they are for.Answer #2: You can quit.

If that does not change their mind, those of you willing to do so can threaten to quit, and then follow through."}
{"question":"So the house next door to my dad’s house is for rent, once again. The landlord made it section 8, in a neighborhood that is far from section 8. Mostly everyone in the neighborhood is very quiet and old. They all keep to their selves. The landlord keeps moving in people who have large parties, let their kids run around in the road, and the last 3 tenants have had the cops there CONSTANTLY. The landlord is not apart of an HOA. I plan to talk to him and ask him if he will do a background check on the next people he moves in, but another neighbor told me he is very rude and unresponsive to this. Is there anything I can do? Or should I just suck it up and shut the fuck up?\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" Unless they're breaking noise ordinances or doing anything illegal, there's nothing you can do.  \n\n\"neighborhood is far from section 8\" is a pretty fucked way to describe things, too.

{"question":"Can a individual legally move into a abandoned home\/ ghost town which we have many in Michigan rebuild and or repopulate? Legally?\n","answer":" You can move into the area as a squatter, then as long as you treat it as your own for 10(?) years it can become legally yours. Answer #2: Or you could look up who the owner of the house you want is, and offer to buy it for some incredibly low sum.Answer #3: The other side of this as well is that you can pick up some of those properties for next to nothing at tax sales and not have to deal with the risk of squatting.  Some of them the city may be willing to give away if the property or area is blighted enough because they will get the property taxes."}
{"question":"I have epilepsy. I was hospitalized in the ER after a seizure. After the seizure I had what's called a post-ictal state, which means there are temporary changes to my behavior which I don't remember.  Basically the hospital said they are pressing charges against me because I spit at a nurse in the patient room. The police officer said that \"they have it on tape and, if they see it on tape, you have to go to a judge.\"\n\nIs it legal for a hospital to be filming inside a patient room?

{"question":"Recently, a roofing company came to my street to work-on\/replace the roofs of some of the houses on my street. I did not  hire them for any services, but I let them use my driveway to leave some of their equipment. In addition, many tiles the roofs feel down onto my driveway. Before they left, they did clean up, but did a poor job. When I went to check, I found a nail left in front of my doorstep, and saw many tiles left in my trees. Is there anything I can do?\n","answer":" If you only found one nail after that many roofing jobs, they did a fairly decent job of cleaning up. You could sue them for the clean up, but honestly how much is it going to cost for you to pick up what they didn't?Answer #2: Clean it up. "}

{"question":"I recently moved into a public subsidized housing complex where they allow animals but they discriminate against any Pit-bulls and Rottweilers. My question is seeing I've gotten a new Rottweiler just now thirteen weeks of age, would it be acceptable to pursue acceptance of this animal within the complex as an emotional support animal. There is very little housing I can afford on my student income and being restricted to this single complex that is discriminating against my animal companion makes it extremely difficult on me. Any further suggestions, or thoughts on the subject would be of great assistance.Location Minnesota.\n\nThank You Very Much.\n","answer":" &gt; My question is seeing I've gotten a new Rottweiler just now thirteen weeks of age, would it be acceptable to pursue acceptance of this animal within the complex as an emotional support animal. \n\nEmotional support animals are not a tactic to be used solely to get your pet into a complex.\n\nIf you have an actual diagnosed disorder, and a psychiatrist who agrees that you **require** this animal, maybe.  If you don't have that diagnosis, and a treatment plan, and an order from your treating doctor, then you wouldn't qualify.\n\n"}

The unit is rent stabilized and the rate I have is frankly 30-40% under-market rate.\n\nI love the place and want to live there for many years to come. I am, however, taking a fellowship for the next year out of country and thus want to sublet the apt for the next year. \n\nI will be leaving the apt fully furnished. Am I legally allowed to sublet the apt for more than I am paying, keeping in mind the unit is fully furnished? I can't imagine the landlord can step in and say that I am overvaluing the furniture.\n\nThanks in advance for any and all advice.\n","answer":" &gt; the rate I have is frankly 30-40% under-market rate\n\nThat's the entire point of RSO.\n\nLos Angeles doesn't screw around. If you proceed with this plan you may or may not be sued, but you are likely to lose your tenancy in the unit for violating RSO for one or two reasons. One, using the rental unit for an illegal purpose. Two, failure to renew a similar rental agreement. You would not be able to get the subtenant out, legally, without going to court and testifying that you were illegally subletting the apartment. Way too much of a risk. If allowed, sublet it at the price you pay. Profiting off of something meant to make housing affordable is going to make the city attorney salivate, and with you out of the country, you'd be returning homeless and to a real legal mess."}

{"question":"My wife works for the state of Kansas, and also has eczema. Today she was put on paid leave through Monday and told not to come back until she had a doctor's note clearing her for work again. While she had been told it was due to concerns about communicability, the letter she received from her departments chief counsel was non specific in that regard. Overall it has been a fairly unwelcoming work environment, and we are taking steps to find her a job somewhere else, however she has felt she had a target on her back for months now. She has contacted her dermatologist and the note should not be a problem, but is this something we should be more concerned about?\n","answer":" I mean it's only prudent to make sure that a skin flaking illness is not communicable.

{"question":"I was recently charged $25 by a local business for a service when the written cost on the invoice was $125. I didn't notice until I got home, and frankly, they were quite rude and unpleasant so I was just going to let it sit and do nothing about it. They only had my name, cell number, and credit card number; no other identifying info.\n\nA week later they left me a voicemail and text message saying they realized they mischarged and to go back to get it fix. My question: am I under any legal (not moral) obligation to get this fixed? What is the worst that could happen if I just ignore it? They have no way of knowing that I even gave them a real phone number.\n\nThanks for any advice\n","answer":" You have an obligation to pay the amount agreed to. A mistake in accounts receivable doesn't void or modify the agreement.

The officer took both our licenses, spent quite a while in his car with them, and then told us to leave without saying anything about a ticket or anything or any charges. Does that mean he let us off with a warning, or should we expect to get something in the mail?\n","answer":" Depending on your location, the police will probably have years to decide whether or not to charge\/ticket you. \n\nRealistically, they probably just took your name, checked your background and made a note in case it happened again.

She really has nowhere to go but swears that she'd make sure I wouldn't get custody. I work a stable oilfield schedule, working two weeks on\/off. She says there is no way I'd be awarded split custody, regardless of my schedule. I'm a good father, she has no reason or basis for keeping me from her.

Thanks in advance.\n","answer":" Has she been evaluated for post-partum depression? \n\nThere is a very very good chance you would be awarded joint legal custody; what the physical custody would look like, given your job schedule and the baby's age, is hard to say, but certainly you have a good case for at least some visitation."}
{"question":"The other day I was looking at some of the leaked celebrity nudes and I was brought to a website which seemed to have pictures of every major female celebrity. However, I didn't recognize one of the people and as it turned out, they were relatively young (19). I have high anxiety and OCD so I began searching her age at the time of the picture (19 when it was leaked) and searched pornhub to see if it was there because I know they strictly monitor the site (it was). I am also a little nervous that the site was illegal. It boasted 12,000 pictures and the banner was all adults, but I am nervous that this site was illegal and monitored by the FBI. I think I made this worse by searching if the site was legal or linked by major search engines. The domain name had the word \"banned\" in it but I am not sure if this is just to make it seem scandalous and to refer to the leaked nature of the pics. Basically I am just really paranoid that the FBI will kick in my door. Did I do anything illegal?\n","answer":" I think you may want to check your CO2 monitor.\n\nBut actually, no. The FBI is not kicking down doors of people watching porn. And the site is not actually banned."}
{"question":"I'm curious, what happens to you when you're in the witness protection program? Are you still allowed to use your phone and log into social media? Are you allowed to be seen online, like on Instagram or Facebook? Are you still allowed to talk to immediate family, or do they have to go into witness protection with you? Also, will they kick you out of the program if you text close friends while in witness protection?\n","answer":" People in witness protection are there voluntarily, and are not restricted from resuming their lives. They're not under arrest, their rights have not been restricted by the courts, and they're not under any kind of guardianship.\n\nHowever, if you don't cooperate with the requirements of the program, then the program cannot protect you. The point is to make you hard to find, and making contact with old friends, posting to social media, and otherwise standing up and saying \"here I am\" runs counter to that. If you persist, you can be kicked out of the program, as you're clearly not interested in being protected."}

{"question":"I'm renting a condo unit under what I believe to be a standard contract. I've taken both pay and hours cuts at work and I've been struggling to keep up with bills. My last three rent payments have been paid in full 1 to 10 days late. \n\nToday I received this email. http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wg8q57Qh.jpg\n\nI was under the impression that I could not be penalized for rent payments less than 14 days late, and that after the 14 days the landlord must go through the courts \/ landlord-tenant board for an eviction. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I respond to this?\n","answer":" That's not legal notice of termination, since it's not in one of the forms required by law. If your landlord wants to evict you for non-payment or for persistent late payment, they need to give you one of [these forms](http:\/\/www.sjto.gov.on.ca\/documents\/ltb\/Notices%20of%20Termination%20&amp;%20Instructions\/N4.pdf).\n\nConveniently, that form outlines _exactly_ what you need to do.\n\nHowever, they can give you that form the first day your rent is late, if they want. They don't have to give you 14 days before giving you notice - the date of termination has to be no earlier than 14 days from the date they _do_ give you notice.\n\nPay your rent. Let your landlord know that you expect to be given notice of termination in the legally-required form next time. Stop paying rent late unless you want to be evicted: persistently-late rent can be cause to terminate, once your lease expires."}

My roommate got really mad about this and told me she didn't want any of my guest in the apartment when i wasn't there. so my question is, does she have any legal right to kick guests out my room if i give them permission to be there? say for instance, if she calls the cops saying there is an intruder in the apartment, could my guest get arrested? I'm having guests stay with me soon and i am planning on them staying there while i'm not home and i would like to know if there might be any legal repercussions for this. Also, as far as i know there is nothing in my lease against doing this. I'm in California BTW\n","answer":" Your guest needs to leave when you leave. Your roommate absolutely doesn't have to deal with a stranger when you're not home. It's an unwritten rule of being a good roommate. Answer #2: &gt;  does she have any legal right to kick guests out my room if i give them permission to be there?\n\nUnless your lease has some very unusual rules about guest occupancy, the not.  You both have a right to the apartment if you're both on the lease.  \n\n&gt;  if she calls the cops saying there is an intruder in the apartment, could my guest get arrested?\n\nLegally, they aren't an intruder or trespasser.  But the cops won't know that if nobody is there saying otherwise, so it's not impossible that the police would ask them to leave.  It seems very unlikely they'd be arrested, but again, it's not completely impossible that it would happen because nobody is there in the moment to clear things up."}
{"question":"5 years ago, I met someone online in an online community about music and art. He was 17 at the time. I was 28. We started out as friends talking only online. 2 years later, him 19 and me 30, we met at an art event and we hit it off. \nLast year, we started a relationship. \nHe's 22, I'm 33. \nI understand that our relationship is not conventional but we are happy. But his parents does not approve and threaten me. \nTelling me that what I'm doing is illegal. Calling me a psychopath and other very mean things, calling me a creep and telling me I should date someone my age. My boyfriend is on my side. He doesn't like the way his parents are treating me. \n\nSo, is my relationship an illegal one? \n\nThank you. \n","answer":" You're both adults.  Bang away my friend, bang away.Answer #2: having a relationship with a minor is not illegal.  it's illegal to have sex with them while they are a minor.  so if you never had sex when he was 17, there's nothing to worry about.  Answer #3: You're both adults, so it's legal.Answer #4: Since he is not a minor, as long as he is not developmentally disabled, there is likely no legal barrier to your relationship. \n\nEven going by the \"Half your age plus seven\" rule of thumb, you're only one year off. So I don't think it's nearly as creepy as his parents are making it out to be. Assuming that you are a man, I'd wager to say that the idea that their son is gay is still fresh, and that's playing a lot into their attitude. If you're a woman, then disregard - it just means they're putting their nose where it doesn't belong (which is true in the other situation too). "}
{"question":"My boyfriend has been living with me for the last eight months. He isn't on the lease. He started contributing rent a couple months ago.

I had some social benefits and failed to report to the social security office when I got a job and kept I said benefits.Like I said dumb. I'm a kid in a man's body .But any one for advice or a place to get it. Sorry if I'm doing this wrong or this is the wrong place. I'm in the US.\n","answer":" Never paid taxes or never filed taxes?  That's two different things and everything depends on that.  \n\nMost people like you have standard w2 income so the withholding is done aka paid and then there's commonly a refund.   The IRS is very easy to work with as far as government agencies go.  \n\nThe people you hear with the massive tax issues are usually self employed and don't pay. That would be really uncommon for someone like you.  \n\nSo make a list of all the jobs you had about how much you made and make an appointment with an accountant.   \n\nThe possible issues here range from a return netting you some cash, breaking even to paying but I would feel it's more likely that you're closer to money in than out.  However your accountant will be your friend in this.  They're not free and you need them.  Your accountant will set your strategy but don't be surprised if you file for an extension and spend the summer cleaning this up.  I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep as you're making the correct decisions now.  \n\n\nAlso \/r\/personalfinance should be on your defaults from now on. Answer #2: Unless you have really high earnings, you aren't going to jail. \n\nI had a relative who genuinely believed that the income tax was unconstitutional. He vocally refused to file a return. After several years of arguing with the IRS, he was criminally charged in federal court.  His lawyer prepared and filed the missing returns. He would have received a refund if he had filed.  (You can't get a refund after 3 or 4 years or so.). Anyway, he got convicted but served no jail time. He only got prosecuted because he was vocal about it. \n\nGather the info and file the returns.

{"question":"Now that she's 18 her dad says we can't date because it's a class 1 misdemeanor in VA. Is this true? And is there any way around it? \n","answer":" You can date. You can't have sex (or do anything sexual in nature).Answer #2: Virginia's age of consent is 18. Their is no \"Romeo and Juliet\" exception in Virginia law. As I read this, she is 18 and you and either 16 or 17. Any sexual contact between you two will result in her being guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a $2,500 fine. She may also be required to register as a sex offender, which WILL ruin her life.\n\nThe is no way around this. By law you cannot consent to sexual contact with someone 18 or older until you are 18.

{"question":"Background: a doctor prescribed large amounts of drugs to my nephew who was 19. Nephew died from the drugs.

They are extremely interested and are investigating- but can’t give me any info on what happens next (understandable). They brought in states attorneys and an OIG guy too. \n\nQuestion is, do I need a lawyer myself for any reason? This is an extremely well known and popular doctor in the area- will they know I turned them in? \n\nDoes anyone know what to expect here? What is a DEA investigation like? It’s all so secretive and nobody can tell me anything. I’m so nervous and scared and wondering if this was the right thing to do.\n","answer":" Your anonymity should be held against this doctor.  Since you reported this to the DEA and they have started an investigation, the only things they may need from you is a statement or some evidence of the prescription.  After reporting stuff to any enforcement figure, it tends to be taken out of your hands and becomes a case between \"The Doctor vs. The DEA.\"  \n\n\nAs for secrecy of what info you're being given, the DEA also has to be cognizant of the doctor's rights and that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. They can't go around telling you everything they have if the doctor ends up being innocent.  \n\n\nYou most likely won't need a lawyer since you simply reported it and were not involved in the incident."}

Would the fact that my school is private mean that they can do this without consequence?\n","answer":" If the school accepts federal funds then Title IX applies. Whether this is prohibited discrimination depends on the exact nature of the event. For example, private clubs are allowed to discriminate based on sex so if this is a student organized event it may be legal (although it might violate school policy if conducted on campus). If it’s a school-organized event it probably isn’t legal, assuming the school is otherwise coed, but there are exceptions.\n\nIf the school doesn’t accept federal funds then Title IX doesn’t apply and the school can legally discriminate against students based on sex."}

If they decide he did he would be charged with murder like anybody else.\n\nIf they decide he didn't that would be his defence to the murder charge and they *may* find he didn't have the legal\/mental capacity to commit a crime.\n\nThe courts would then have to decide what to do with someone who was capable of committing murder but not capable of understanding it was wrong - there's a lot of things that could happen here but the most likely outcome is that he would be put in an institution (i.e. a psychiatric prison) until it was considered safe to release him - which could be months, or could be the rest of his life."}
{"question":"Hello,  \nHere's the scoop: my daughter's mother left three weeks ago with our kids. I was served custody papers the same day.  \nHer reasoning? Heroin addiction.  \nSo, confused and hurt, I filed my response and ordered a hair follicle drug test, which of course came back negative.  \nWe have mediation on Tuesday and I'm not really sure how to proceed. She has spent the past three weeks convincing herself, friends and family that I am a heroin addict (not only do I have a hair follicle test but I pay the rent, my home is clean, orderly and safe, I'm always on time to work, valued in my company, pay my bills, etc.)  \nSo my question is this: if this goes to trial, what is my best course of action? I have text messages from her detailing the emotional and psychological abuse she has put me through, as well as messages from her explaining how she does not love our daughter and has considered abandoning us\/devised a plan for doing so.\n","answer":" Your best coarse of action is to hire an attorney\n\nOther than that. Document everything and keep it very organized for court. Answer #2: Lawyer. Now. Right now. You need to make sure you have an attorney to make sure your drug test results are properly admitted if you go to court. You need a lawyer to help you show your ex is keeping the kids from you for no reason. These are serious allegations. Even if they are baseless, you do not want to fool around. Get a lawyer first thing Monday. "}

Didn't want to give them a hard time and get booked (which would immediately end my career considering I am 100% guilty) so I talked. Worked short term but how screwed am I long term?\n","answer":" Your level of screwed went up by a factor of 1000 when you talked.  \n\nUnless they have a video camera in the massage room, or the cooperation of the massage girl, they had absolutely ZERO evidence that you committed a crime until you gave it to them.   If they had a video camera or the cooperation of the attendant, you'd have never left the building - they'd have arrested you then and there.  \n\nYou may get lucky and never hear from them, but if they reach out...  it will be ENTIRELY because you talked."}

I do not want to spend another minute in jail, 6 hours was more than enough.\n","answer":" KS mandates that you change your license and registration after 90 days of establishing residency.\n\nDid you change your insurance address? It might be that NY has suspended your license and registration because you moved out of state."}
{"question":"I moved into an apartment 2 months ago and the hot water doesnt work. Per my lease it says all maintenance issues need to be requested in writing, and I email them every week about the issue but it gets ignored. Two weeks ago they had a plumber come by and installed a new thermostat on the heater and it fixed the issue temporarily ( 3 days ). I pay $1200 a month at this place and I'm under the impression that hot water being out makes the unit uninhabitable. I guess I'm going to get a new heater installed myself - and deduct it from rent. Is there anything I can do about the 2400 in rent I've paid already in an 'uninhabitable' apartment?   \n","answer":" From a brief google search, the LL has 7 days after written notice from you to fix the problem. If the LL does, then you can start witholding rent. But you must give proper notice and advise you will be withholding rent if the matter is not fixed. \n\n\nThe 7 day repair requirement is to certain habitability matters.

I probably won't ever be back at VT, do I necessarily need to pay the ticket?\n","answer":" VT and U.Va. are pretty good at getting the DMV involved.

What kind of situation would allow for this? I would imagine if the parents were deemed unfit for one child they would be unfit to care for their other children. \n","answer":" Complete guess : might be due to age difference?

{"question":"I am renewing my Captains license and one of the requirements is passing a drug test.  I went in for a test at Labcorp on Dec. 12 and was told that my results would be returned within 3 days.  Five days later I still had not received my results.  I was told to follow up directly with the lab they had sent my sample to.  When I called the lab to which I was referred, I received an answering machine stating that my call will be returned within 24 hours.  No returned call, even after multiple voicemails left over a week long period.  Called Labcorp again today only to be told that they had lost my sample and I would need to come in for a retest.  My renewal packet is due to the Coastguard next week or my license will expire and I'll have to go through the entire training course again.  Do I have any sort of recourse?\n","answer":" What is it, 2:30 pm in Hawaii?  Get yourself over to a Labcorp and tell a supervisor the situation.  See if you can retest right now.  They should have the results by the 2nd.Answer #2: Contact Labcorp for a higher up supervisor and expedite if you can. However, within a weekend, you might be limited. Can you contact the Coast Guard and ask them which protocol you need to follow? Answer #3: I promise you this has happened before and it's probably not all that bleak. So first things first- contact the Regional Exam Center in Honolulu  at (808)-522-8274.\n\nThey might redirect you to someone else at either the National Maritime Center or somewhere else. There may be a waiver process if it is that dire. \n\nPersonally, I doubt it is. I'm guessing when you first got your license you took a local course like Boatwise. Those are not requirements at the Federal level. The CG allows those to be taken in lieu of the CG exam. All other requirements are the same, which means you have the hours required to take the exam if your license truly does lapse.\n\nNow, I may be wrong about some of this due to state regulations and not knowing what class of masters license you have\/need, but no matter what, your first call should be to the REC."}

During this time they are expected to sleep on cots in hallways or empty rooms if some are available. They are not paid at all (not even a reduced rate) until their shift starts 13 hours later.\n\nMy question: Is this legal? I checked with some other friends who work for the same hospital system and they are hearing the same thing from their managers. So this is definitely an organizational thing and not just a rogue manager. \n","answer":" They have to be paid for all hours worked. That includes hours that they are \"engaged to wait\", which is what's happening here. If the powers that be refuse to pay, file a claim for unpaid wages with the FLSA.Answer #2: If it's mandatory they come in, it must be paid. This would be no different than if the hospital had a meeting and said they all must attend, then the speaker didn't show up. They would still get paid.\n\nYour friend should say they expect to get paid and then point out if they don't, they'll file a wage claim and get the hours and once the claim is filed it may trigger a wage audit.

{"question":"John Oliver appears to be named on much of the paperwork for the non-profit organization, but by having an actress appear as a fictitious wife, could this not be an instance of fraud\/deception that would undermine the otherwise carefully planned legitimacy of the organization?\n","answer":" a) It's a satire.

Could you go through and take all the fire extinguishers so they have to close down for safety reasons?\n\nIt's pretty niche, so I doubt many people are ever going to need to know, but I wondered whether there are rules on what you should reposess before you start taking items that are critical to keeping a business\/house safe and open.\n","answer":" Yes, in general the sheriff can help you repossess assets of the business, which will be sold at auction to pay off the judgment.\n\nBut the sheriff is not stupid.  The fire extinguishers are going to sell for $10, despite their original cost being much higher.  The sheriff is going to concentrate on cash and other things that convert easily into cash.\n\nSame deal with the IRS.  They can take anything to pay off your tax debt.  But they'll concentrate on bank accounts and yachts and gold bullion, not old pairs of gym socks.\n\nIt's not punitive.  You can't use it as a weapon to inflict extra injury.

They'll send you a free strip reader and you can opt to purchase a chip reader, but you can also type in the numbers manually and run the card that way.

{"question":"She wants a divorce and I knew it was bad. I cant say i didn't see this coming. I ripped the phone out of her hand. I know that wasn't a great idea but I couldn't help it. She climbed all over me and tried to get it back. She hidden the number under a women's name they have been talking alot with. I tried to give her the space she needed knowing it might not work. Long story short she will most likely file for divorce or should I? at this point. I told her to go to her mom's house or her new boyfriend's. I'm not going anywhere we just moved into our new home 3 months ago. Im keeping the kids for the weekend. I moved away from my home state less then a year ago to make her happy I have no one here for support. Should I change the locks put her stuff in boxes in the garage. She can go back to her supporting parents. While we figure out the law side of things. I'm working on getting an attorney ASAP.\n","answer":" You absolutely cannot kick her out, change the locks or ban her from the house.\n\nIf you want a divorce then consult a lawyer and get one.Answer #2: Do not change locks or move her things.  You cannot evict someone in that fashion who has a right to love there.  Contact a divorce attorney if you want to split up.\n\nStop grabbing phones and getting physical unless you want a domestic violence case on your record.  You will have a hard time keeping a job with DV on your record.Answer #3: You can't throw her out, or any of her things. You cannot change the locks. She is as entitled to the kids as you are. Get an attorney and follow his\/her advice, do not make anything worse between now and then."}
{"question":"California \n\nSo while my roommate was at school and I was gone for a moment, my girlfriend heard a commotion. Employees from my apartment complex entered into my apartment without a written notice, email, or phone call. My girlfriend heard a knock at the door but didn’t answer, then heard someone enter the apartment. She thought it was my roommate but turns out it was a male and female who used keys to enter our apartment. They claimed to see if the apartment was furnished (they offer furnished apartments for a higher price which I passed on for a cheaper price) which is in our contracts. After that, they checked to see if our locks on our bedrooms worked. My GF watched them the whole time. It makes me uneasy and I’ve never had to deal with this in the past. Is there any advice or any actions I am entitled to? Please help me out guys.\n","answer":" I would set up a camera or two inside when not home and see what happens as well.  I suspect there was something very different happening than checking the furniture.Answer #2: California has decent tenant privacy laws. You can find some info by Googling \"California Landlord Tenant PDF\" (I tried to link it, but Reddit didn't like the link)\n\nIf you choose to speak with the landlord, do it in writing so you've got the paper trail incase you need to escalate the situation. Answer #3: Call your landlord and remind them to give you notice in the future."}
{"question":"Hello,\nSo when I was born my mom believed a guy named Caleb to be my dad so he was put on my birth certificate (after he signed something as well). I never met him so I knew nothing about him. But earlier this year I took a DNA test via 23andme and matched with a guy named Jacob who turned out to be my actual father. Now that I know do I have to correct my birth certificate or can I just leave it alone?\n","answer":" Depends on how old you are and what you want.  If you are a minor, practically speaking, your mom would have to do everything if you wanted a change.  And it could certainly have child support implications for your newly named father.\n\nSince you didn’t list a location, I’m speaking with generalized US advice.   For more, we need your age, location, and to know if you know who your biological dad is.\n\nMost states won’t allow the removal of a father from the birth certificate of a minor unless a new father is named, that way if you go on welfare the state has someone to go after.\n\nAs an adult, birth father really only impacts inheritance and next of kin for medical decisions.  So no need to change anything.\n\nGive us a little more info and we’ll give you some clearer answers."}
{"question":"For work I pick up product from a storage facility. They usually have one elevator working at a time and todays elevator didn't go to my floor so somebody had to take me up when I was done doing what I had to I rang the elevator and nothing. I tried every elevator on the floor and waited. There's no was to know what floors the elevators are on or if they're coming up or not. So after waiting a while I wanted to go down a floor where all elevators go to see if I can catch the working one there and I found out that they lock all the doors to staircases. All emergency exits, and there's no fire escape. If I didn't have my phone to call downstairs I'd be locked in the top floor indefinitely even worst if there was a fire in the building. What do I do here who do I report this sort of thing to? It can't be legal.\n","answer":" Call the fire department.  They'll be happy to issue a ton of fines."}
{"question":"Hey Reddit, German law student here!\n\nI am writing a paper on the boundaries that german courts face, when they publish their decisions. In Germany these decisions are usually anonymized, to protect the identities of the people involved (f.e. Martin Brown would become M.B.).\n\nHowever, that is not the case in the US and many other jurisdictions (Brown v Baker etc.). So I wondered, what is the rationale behind stating the full names of the people involved (and not anonymising them), if there is any at all?\n","answer":" Names are typically only redacted in child custody matters or other situations where there is a risk of harm to the parties involved, such as domestic abuse cases.\n\nThe reason is that as a general rule in America we treat our court records as open public documents that anyone can access.  Unless there is a demonstrated danger or harm to publication of a name the fact that you were involved in a lawsuit isn’t in and of itself harmful and so to be as transparent as possible we keep the records fully open."}
{"question":"I work in ad sales. A few months ago I sold several ads to a client, invoiced them, and they never paid. Now my boss is telling me I'm responsible. At first I thought he meant repaying comission I earned, but then he clarified that I am actually responsible for repaying the full sale price of their ads (~$5k total), and that we will discuss a \"plan for me to pay it off\" on Monday.\n\nIs that legal?\n","answer":" No. That is not at all legal. The client is responsible for the incursion of any and all debt as a result of services provided at their request. The \"plan\" your boss should have should be for him to contact the company attorney to discuss a lawsuit or other legal actions against the client."}

But when I call with *67 it goes through leading me to believe that she has blocked my number. Should I call again with *67 and confront her about blocking my number?

I'm mostly leaning towards a lawsuit but I have no idea on how to get that started and I really really do not want to not do that unless it's my last option.\n\nCalifornia \n","answer":" Do NOT go to their house.

{"question":"I was involved in a hit and run. The driver was found as of today... just over a month after the accident. The detective gave me his insurance information. \n\nI contacted a lawyer because my insurance company refused to cover the accident. I broke my arm and needed surgery. I am out about $6000 for the car plus medical expenses. I do have health insurance under my parents so my main concern was the value of the car. Now that I have the driver's insurance information, is it necessary to continue with the lawyer? \n\nI just don't want to get screwed out of 33% of the value of the car because I went with a lawyer. I imagine I could get something for the arm injury, but I'm not trying to drag this out and screw over this guy. \n\n\nTopic:\nPersonal Injury\n","answer":" You don't *need* a lawyer. But having a lawyer may be helpful in negotiations with the driver's insurance company.\n\nKeep in mind that you may owe this lawyer some compensation, depending on how far your case went with them. Check any agreements you made to be sure."}
{"question":"So a friend of mine got a girl pregnant. Hes still in high school and she had an abortion. The girls parents want him to pay for all of it. He and I both think he should only pay for half since it takes two to have a baby. Is there anyway they can force him to pay for all of it or even any of it? We live in Florida by the way if that makes a difference. Thankyou for your help in advance. Hes very stressed out and I'm trying to help.\n","answer":" Legally? The abortion was the choice of the girl and\/or her parents. Your friend *should* have no responsibility. IANAL.\n\nEthically? Like you said, it takes two to make a baby, and so long as it was consentual, your friend should pay half of it, because it was both people's decision.Answer #2: He doesn't  have to pay for any of it since it was the gf's choice to have the abortion. The right thing would be to pay for half. If they did decide to sue over it (which i don't know what they would sue for), it would be taken to small claims court. As long as your friend didn't sign anything saying he'd pay 100% of it, then they wont win. \n"}

I signed a contract and got a used Jeep Cherokee. We got the car the next day after getting the insurance. We got the keys and they said everything was all good to go. Now we are getting text messages telling us we are being forced to go back and sign a new contract with lower payments. They didn't go into detail much. After we declined they said we had no choice and if we didn't go they would take the car back. It's my first time buying a car and I'm young so im extremely worried they are taking advantage of me. I remember signing a paper that said I wasn't allowed to get an attorney if things were to go south. \n\nSo now I'm freaking out and I don't know if they're trying to scam me or something.

Is there a case the step mother can make for custody worth putting up the fight for?\n\nDivorce was 50\/50 of property. Adoption\/guardianship was not affordable at the time. Grandma has moved into the house where ex-husband lived, where the kids still live (9,13,14,17). Eldest will turn 18 in August. Nothing in the divorce about the kids. Grandma is kind of crazy.\n\n","answer":" If she has been raising them all this time, and the kids want to stay with her, odds are really good that they can.  Especially considering that she had custody of them post-divorce, it sounds like.\n\nAs a life advice, the best bet is to talk to the grandma and see if you can work out a positive visitation schedule, so that she feels appreciated and has time with her grandkids, without disrupting those kids' lives further.  They've lost both their birth parents, that's pretty rough. "}

{"question":" My ex girlfriend and I had an apartment together and when things ended between us I told her I was going out of state to get settled somewhere new and would come back for my dog and other personal items after I was settled and had the money to fly my dog back with me.   \n\n\nWe maintained contact the whole time. I sent her money for food and flea medication, as well as sent money to my dog sitter who watched him during the days.   \n\n\nIts now been a month, I'm finally settled in and have a new job. my ex contacted me a few days ago saying that she didn't want to watch my dog anymore and I arranged for my mom to pick him up yesterday.   \n\n\nUpon arrival we learned that she sold my dog to the dog sitter who has no intention of ever giving him back to me. They said they waited for 30 days before making the sale legal.   \n\n\nWhat steps do I need to take to get my dog back? Can she leggaly do that?   \n\n\nShe knew i was coming back and I'm so shocked and blindsighted. \n","answer":" Find any evidence you have you own the dog. Adoption papers, vet bills, photos, whatever.\n\nContact the police, file a police report for theft. Dogs are considered property and no amount of \"waiting 30 days\" makes it legal to sell something that does not belong to you OR legal to keep something you bought that was actually stolen.\n\nFind out the name or address of the person the dog was sold to. Go ask them to give it back. Sometimes the police will come with you to get it.Answer #2: You're allowed to leave your property with someone else who offers to look after it while you are temporarily looking for a new place. Likewise, the person watching your property has the right to decide they no longer want to watch your property and let you find someone else who will or let you come retrieve it. In no circumstances are they allowed to sell your property to someone else, nor is someone in this situation able to legally acquire ownership of your property from such a sale.\n\nSo you have an ex who illegally sold your property, and you have a pet sitter who knowingly bought your property from someone who does not have the right to sell it.\n\nCall the police for whatever area your ex\/pet-sitter reside and file a report for theft of property. Best case: they surrender your dog; Worst case: you need to sue the Pet Sitter to return your dog."}
{"question":"My wife is an employed professional (exempt).  Her employer is doing some renovations to the office.  Apparently there were not enough funds to do everything her \"boss\" (company has a very ambiguous org chart) wanted.  Therefore, the boss is expecting all of professionals in the office to share the cost of artwork she wants on the walls.  The artists are approved by the company although there do not seem to be any apparent ethical safeguards against kickbacks and such.  It is unclear who would actually \"own\" the art.\n\nI have tried to google about the legality of this but always find charity donation scenarios instead of directly buying things for the company.  It seems like there would be some employment laws against this?  However, I realize exempt employees have very few protections relative to others.  Thank you for any help.\n","answer":" Well, they can't \"force\" her to buy the artwork, nor can they take money out of her paycheck to pay for it without her consent.\n\nBut \"at will employment\" means that she can be fired for any reason or no reason at all (except membership in a protected class) so, as stupid as it sounds, she could actually be fired over this. \n\nHow do the other professionals in the office feel about this idea? One person saying no it likely to go poorly for that person, but multiple people saying no might tie their hands more. \n\nHaving said that though, I'd be highly concerned about the solvency of her employer (both now and into the future) if they can't even complete a renovation without running out of funds.

Do I lawyer up and sue the guy cause I need a replacement car. Or talk to his insurance cause he's at fault? Help.\n","answer":" You're entitled to the current market value of the car, plus any contents, OR the cost of repair -- nothing more.

{"question":" Do you charge friends for legal services?\nQuestion:I'm a pretty new Texas lawyer. Do you charge friends for stuff like filing suits or short court appearances? Thanks!\n","answer":" IANAL but my sister is. She charges family only for filing fees or actual costs for minor legal problems, but absolutely will not get involved with large legal issues. She does this tactfully, by saying she wouldn't be comfortable working on areas outside of her expertise. She has a great list of specialist attorneys she sends folks to, and she does this so gracefully, you'd never know she's just said no. For friends, she might send them information links along with the referral, but she doesn't file anything or even offer legal advice.\n\nAs I'm sure you already know, you're now **the** go-to person for all legal problems, much as I'm sure doctors are. If you don't establish boundaries immediately, you're screwed. Final piece of advice, if you don't value your time, no one else will. \n\nCongratulations on getting your law degree! Answer #2: Are you working for a firm?  If yes they almost certainly have a policy on this that involves running a conflict check and getting approval for pro bono work.  If you shortcut the firm's process you won't be covered by their malpractice insurance, which is a bad idea."}
{"question":"Hi, i just received a speeding ticket and needed some advice. The ticket was for 91 in a 50 zone, i was stopped by the city police officer and was able to provide license, registration and insurance. The officer was pretty cool after he realized i was just a stupid teenager. He only cited me for speed but i have to appear in court. This was my 3rd ticket in 6 months in ohio. My question i guess is how screwed am i as far as keeping my license? Will a lawyer be able to help me keep school and work privileges?  I honestly have learned my lesson this time. I will probable sell my civic si and get the slowest vehicle possible if i can still drive. This will be i. The mayors court this Wednesday. Thanks.\n","answer":"  If you want to save your license you should get a lawyer. Even then I kind of doubt it. Have you done the math on speeding? Unless you're traveling something close to 500 miles it doesn't end up making much of a difference.  Between stoplights, traffic, and rest stops you don't get that much of a time advantage – particularly considering the enhanced risk of a ticket. \n\nIf you lose your license it will be what you deserve.  Three speeding tickets in six months is insane. I was a crazy teenager and I didn't even get close to that. That means you are way, way over the line. Your insurance costs will go through the roof. \n\n Still, You need to max out your liability coverage. $250,000 or $1 million minimum. Driving at 91 miles an hour if you get into a collision with another car you can ruin many lives. You don't want a judgment of that size hanging around your neck for the rest of your life.Answer #2: You're young with no experience. Your license is toast, my friend.\n\nIt's one thing to speed, but it's another to intentionally put lives in danger. If you were in Virginia, you would be a criminal.Answer #3: 3rd in 6 months? Plus driving 40 mph over the limit. \n\nYou can get a lawyer but I don't think you should bother. You're already at a disadvantage because you're young and you deserve to lose your license for a while IMO"}
{"question":"I live in an apartment in Upstate New York. When we moved in we requested dead bolts on the doors but that request was met with silence. We found our basement door only had a small slide lock that could easily be bypassed. We opted to put a pad lock on the outside door leading into the basement. We recently found our landlord removed the latch on the backdoor, essentially giving outside access into our apartment.\n\nMy question is since we do not feel safe and we'd made requests to add additional security to our apartment is there any possible legal recourse?\n\nThank you for your time. \n","answer":" Not having a working lock for your door is a violation of NY State's Implied Warranty of Habitability, just like if the apartment didn't have heat or was infested with vermin. Your steps are to inform the LL, in writing, of the problem and that it needs to be fixed. If the LL doesn't fix it, you can sue him for a rent reduction (or withhold rent, but this latter course tends to make people really angry and it's best to have the law on your side first).

So maybe you guys can help me answer some questions on how applications would affect a female divorcee and a male divorcee.\n\nIn terms of applications, be it DMV, job, school, buying car, leasing business, etc where the question asked \"What is your marital status?\":\n\n1. Are you required to expand on this with details? With whom? When? How long? Why?\n\n2. What if you put single even though you had a divorce?\n\n3.

If it's either single or married and your divorce is final, then you aren't legally married any more so put \"single\".\n\nNot a lawyer, but I am divorced and that's the reasoning I use.\n\n1. Nobody has ever asked for any additional information.\n2. If you are not currently legally married to someone, you are single. The past history of being married or not is irrelevant.\n3.

{"question":"I was driving down S Lowry street in Smyrna TN when a driver pulled out of a bar right in front of me. I slammed on my brakes but unfortunately was unable to avoid a collision.

I'm trying to understand all my legal options and which course of actions is most beneficial. \n","answer":" Have you contacted your insurance company?  Did you call the police and did they make a report?  \n\nJust because the guy was drunk and on his cell phone doesn't mean that he is solely liable for the collision.  \n\nTo your edit:  \n\n&gt;My Sentra was totalled and the insurance appraisers aren't providing me with enough funds to pay off what I owe on the vehicle.\n\nThe insurance will only pay you fair market value of what the car is worth right before it was damaged.  If that value is lower than what you owe, there's nothing you can do.  You should have had gap insurance on it.  \n\nYou can sue the other driver for any damages you may have.  But if your full fair market value is being paid by your insurance company you can't sue the other driver for that because you've already been made whole by your insurance.

{"question":"Throwaway for reasons - \n\nTo preface this, my brother works in finance for a car dealership. Every finance deal he does with a certain bank, he is awarded $100 from the dealership. As a company, if they hit a collective goal with that bank they get lower interest rates which is why they give individuals the $100 incentive. \n\nIn September, my brother completed 5 deals with said bank, and received the $500 on his November 1st paycheck. In October, he completed 13 deals totaling $1300. His paycheck he received on December 1st was only for $800, citing a $500 deduction. They deducted his September deals because they implemented a new policy on 11\/29 stating that if the company didn't reach their collective goal, incentives wouldn't be paid out. \n\nSo my question is, can they deduct something they already paid him, for a new rule they just enacted? \n\nLet me know if this wasn't clear. First time posting here. \n","answer":" Location matters a lot here. Generally if he earned it under the old rule he's due it.Answer #2: It may vary by state but as a rule of thumb your employer can’t deduct anything from your paycheck without your signature or a government orderAnswer #3: Depends on location. \n\nIn some places bonuses &amp; commission that aren't written into the employment contract are completely up to the employer and can be revoked at **any** stage up to and including the date of payment.\n\nNow while this means they can't retroactively take back Septembers pay, they can in effect do the same thing by taking the $500 off the October bonus for any and no reason that doesn't fall under a protected class (i.e. not a reason that would give rise to a discrimination suit).Answer #4: Side issue - is the bonus to the dealership fully disclosed to the buyers? Steering buyers to a specific lender is explicitly prohibited in real estate under RESPA - are the kickbacks for auto lenders likewise illegal or are they ok?"}

We were both shocked when she was told that by the Air Force recruiter.  The charge was a felony assault on a police officer from 11 years ago (She spit at an officer) which was dismissed.

As odd as it sounds it happens, I can attest to not remembering a damn thing about a charge I was picked up on as a child but remember it involved community service, and I'm an attorney myself. It sounds to me that when she says \"dismissed\" she is recalling that the charge was either subject to something like a conditional discharge or an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal. Community service is often required by the DA in exchange for the offer. So, she may be fine with the armed services after all. She should go to the clerk of the county\/city where the offense was committed and ask, if they cant tell her with a quick search she should request a copy of her DCJS or whatever your state's equivalent of a rap sheet is. \n\nThe \"dismissed charge would be wiped in 5 years\" part also sounds like a misremembrance.

If you can prove she's actually committed adultery, it might impact spousal support, but that's it.Answer #2: If you confront her in this, all that you accomplish is to inform her that you know about *this* incident. If she's determined to cheat--and her making plans to do so while you're out certainly suggests it--then the next time will be better hidden from you. Further, you also inform her that any divorce proceedings should happen on **her** terms, not yours; you'll probably be back in here in due time asking for advice to handle that mess. Finally, depending on how this confrontation plays out, you could well find yourself in the backseat of a squad car being taken in for a domestic incident charge of some sort.\n\nEdit: While those texts may not affect your divorce and\/or custody efforts, a domestic charge accompanied by a protective order damn sure will, so that's another reason to not even get into anything with her.\n\nJust avoid that crap, go see your attorney. This is going to be a shitshow regardless, make it as stress-free and quick for yourself as you can."}
{"question":"I've been dumpster diving at this strip mall for a couple of months now, and one of the business owners(I believe) said I could dumpster dive there(1 dumpster).

How should I precede?\n","answer":" In general that is to keep people from dumping stuff into it, not taking it out"}
{"question":"My wife recently filed for divorce in retaliation to me declining to sign agreement forms for embryo adoption a month after she moved out due to years of an unhappy marriage (following 4 years of infertility struggles, depression, etc.). The embryo adoption would be scheduled for Oct-Nov so she needs a divorce ASAP in order to be the only required signature on the adoption forms as my state (Illinois) requires a 6 month separation period before granting divorce. In order to bypass this, she has cited emotional abuse and drug abuse as the reasons for divorce.\n\nMy question is, does this have any implications for me? Are there any legal ramifications to me if I just agree to the divorce on these terms? I am willing and likely able to fight the accusations but if it doesn't have any impact on me, I'd rather get out immediately.\nTopic:\nCustody Divorce and Family\n","answer":" Not from Illinois, so I don't know specific divorce laws.\n\nThat said, in many states, there are likely implications as far as how things such as alimony and property division would be determined if the divorce was under conditions that implicate you having broken the law (i.e. drug abuse, even if you don't get 'charged' with it, would tend to be something the court wouldn't look kindly on.)\n\nSounds like you should lawyer up, however. I get the feeling that otherwise she will first, and you'll be more likely to wind up paying for that too."}

{"question":"Hello! I am going to be a high school senior, in New York State. Recently some guys in my grade made fake porn, using photoshopped pictures of me and my friends (ie: they put our faces on porn stars’ bodies, and labeled with our full names). These aren’t just naked, but really gross, graphic stuff. The pictures have been posted on different social media accounts. The tumblr one got taken down, but then they made another account. \n\n\nI don’t want to tell my parents, because it’s too embarrassing, but if I call the police, will they find out? Also there are rumors about who did it, but no one has proof. \n","answer":" You can and should report this to the police.  While “fake” porn is generally legal, when it depicts an individual who is actually under age it may be actionable.  That said, if the police investigate it will likely result in your parents finding out.  The thing is, you have don’t absolutely nothing wrong, so while it might be embarrassing, hopefully your parents are understanding and helpful.Answer #2: You should tell your parents. You didn’t do anything wrong and have nothing to be embarrassed about.  \n\nAnswer #3: Report it to the police, in most cases, simulated pornography is treated like the real thing. If any of the pictures of you and your friends are from before you're 18, the people uploading the pictures could be investigated for underage pornography.\n\nConsider that people who do this are often stalkers and abusers. Girls have committed suicide over stuff like this being done to them. You need to have no sympathy for the people who did this. Report it to the police."}
{"question":"So last night me and my friend got pulled over for \"failure\" to make a stop at the stop sign. Anyways, the smell of weed coming from the car is undeniable, as soon as the cop got to the window he asked us where to weed was. Eventually after calling a another unit they found everything. We had around 30-35 grams on us and 600-700 dollars, they took us in for possession to sell. I was put in jail and bailed out by my brother at 5 am. They kept our phones for evidence, which I'm very worried about.\n\nI just turned 20 and his is my first marijuana possession\/drug charge, what are my options? Am I facing any time?

Grant him a license to use the land and you'll be fine; although that raises the possibility of him claiming an easment by estoppel."}

{"question":"For about a week now, I’ve been CIT for a camp I went to myself for about 5 years before (ages of campers there range from 8-15) . My last year as a camper, a kid in my age group was caught trying to force himself onto a younger girl. Two years on, and he was allowed back as a CIT after a year long process they had in place. He’s been here a week and that process has clearly failed. He shoplifted a store we visited but the camp director said that because he wasn’t caught when doing it and the store alarms didn’t go off, they can’t kick him out even though a staff member and a camper witnessed it and a bag of Cheetos magically appeared in our living area. On top of that, most of the other CITs don’t know about his past can see he’s very unstable. (Manipulation and gross sexual comments) Apparently the staff are still “in talks” on if he should be allowed to stay.

How they behave, who does what, when, where, for how long, who spends more time away, with you and so on. They have to assess who’s gonna be a better fit for you.

So doesn't Twitter have the only other rights to the picture to distribute it and publicize it?\nWhat I'm trying to find out if there is anything she can get out of this and if it is even worth it to take legal action?\nthanks! :D\n","answer":" You should be able to file an App Store dispute which notifies both the seller and Apple about the issue.

{"question":"Coming home on Halloween I was pulled over on a stretch of highway where the speed limit drops from 65 to 55 on the freeway for doing what the cop at the time said was 86 mph. It is fairly difficult for my car to do 86 mph and I very rarely drive over 70 so I am very doubtful I was actually doing that speed and feel like I was screwed over by a cop taking advantage of someone on Halloween night and at the end of the month. My court date is January 20th because you have to attend for super speeder tickets. Just wondering if there's any way of fighting it or getting it reduced since I really do feel wronged here. I was also given a breathalizer because he thought I was drunk but I passed it. I think he may have been agitated that I was not drunk when he pulled me over.\n","answer":" &gt;  Just wondering if there's any way of fighting it\n\nThe ticket should have instructions on the process for challenging it.  You're free to do that.\n\nHaving said that, a large issue with your defense is that you don't actually know how fast you were going.  The officer will testify that you were going 86, based upon whatever means he measured that.  Your rebuttal testimony will be, effectively, \"No way, dude!\"  That doesn't generally work very well.\n\nAlso, you should refrain from complaining about \"getting screwed\" when you were stopped for speeding.  You admit you were going *at least* 15 miles over the limit.  Judges generally don't like when people whine about getting caught red-handed."}

Don't even use the same pattern of passwords (if you had been using character names from a favourite show, don't use character names from any show you watch), and set recovery questions\/answers to things he doesn't know about. Reason for the factory reset is to wipe out keyloggers - any device to which he's had physical access is suspect until examined by a professional and cleared.

Factory reset wipes out installed programs, including software keyloggers."}
{"question":"I thought this was a really interesting question that \/u\/oddun posed elsewhere. As an EU citizen, is the government allowed to strip my EU citizenship and rights without my consent? I thought it was an interesting legal question and wonder the validity of such an argument if someone wanted to take it to court. \n\nIt seems like this would be pretty illegal to me, especially considering the government is refusing to allow this to go to a parliamentary vote. Considering I voted remain, and under no terms do I want to leave the EU on a personal level, regardless of the country as a whole, would someone be able to take that argument to court and have a case?\n\nAlso, this isn't a political question, it's more of a 'what if' scenario, genuinely interested to see what people have to say!\n\nI thought maybe someone here would be able to answer this, as it is not something I have seen posted anywhere else. Thanks!\n","answer":" Honestly, that's something that no one can answer right now because there is no precedent, as no nation has ever left the EU. It's a question that will no doubt be hashed out in the EU councils and most likely the courts for a long time to come. \n\nThe best argument that I could see is that there is technically no such thing as an \"EU citizenship\" because the EU is not a sovereign state as such; it's a confederation of individual sovereign member states (albeit one with some federal characteristics). \"EU citizenship\" is just a shorthand way of saying \"citizenship of a state that is a member of the EU.\" If the state of which you are a citizen secedes from the confederation, then you would no longer be a citizen of a member nation and thus no longer part of the EU, simple as that. \n\nOf course, practically speaking, even with the hardest of hard Brexits, with no freedom of movement or trade and no EU influence over British law, there will no doubt be accommodations made in certain situations, such as granting some sort of residency rights to British citizens already living in other EU states. In general though, British citizens can't really remain \"EU citizens\" if Britain leaves the EU. "}
{"question":"So I'm not too familiar with employment\/labour law in Ontario, Canada (where we're from) and I'm asking this for my mom. She worked for a company for 2 months (she passed the 1 month probation period) and was told she would have 2 weeks of vacation a year. As it got closer to tax season she was asked to work overtime (she accumulated around 100 hours) and was to be compensated with more vacation time. However, after 2 months, she made a mistake with payroll confirmation (it did not go through on pay day) and was subsequently fired. They paid her for her normal hours but told her that because she was paid monthly and that her overtime was to be compensated with vacation days, she will not be getting money for the overtime hours she worked. But because she's no longer employed she can't even use those vacation days. \n\nIs this legal? Is she entitled to those overtime hours? \n","answer":" She can be fired for making a mistake, and since she was only there for 2 months, there is no statutory requirement for payment in lieu of notice.  \n\nYou mentioned tax season, so she should be aware that there are some occupations that are exempt from overtime provisions, such as CPAs. If she is not exempt, she should make sure that she does not have an averaging agreement, because that could impact the amount of overtime she is owed.\n\nOntario does allow employers, with written permission from employees, to provide vacation time instead of payment for overtime, but the employer still must follow the rules - i.e. if the time should be paid at time and a half, it should be accumulated at time and a half as well.\n\nCall the Ministry of Labour to get this sorted out."}

{"question":"A month ago I received a letter served at work letting me know my ex has a baby and I am to take a paternity test. I absolutely had no idea she was even pregnant. Long story short, I am the father. I do want to have a relationship with my daughter. I've spoken to the mother and she is willing to work with me to establish parenting time and negotiate child support, insurance, etc. My question is, what items do people typically negotiate in terms of money. For example, does the mother automatically get to claim the child on her taxes in MI? I obviously will cover the child with my health insurance, but if the mother agrees to receive less in the way of monthly child support,  could I offer up to pay half on braces, glasses, pay the 20&amp;#37; of her health care needs, and give mom every year to claim child?  We've spoken to a couple of different lawyers, and we are definitely working on retaining one, but in the meantime, I hoped I could get some clarity on these subjects here. \n","answer":" There isn’t really a negotiation with respect to money. There’s a statutory calculation that takes into account the income of both parents and sets an amount. \n\nYour order is very likely to be at or near the amount set by the calculator. Answer #2: Wait, are you consulting lawyers together or separately? I'd consult a lawyer on your own. Answer #3: You’ll both figure out a schedule or set amounts as to who does what and when while you’re in mediation. Answer #4: To add what others have said, it’s really less of a negotiation than a calculation. If you split custody 50\/50, child support is not needed. If she has more than 50% custody, you’ll pay child support based on your incomes. You can take things like providing health insurance into account when meeting this responsibility. \n\nThe parent who was the child for 183 days or more gets to claim her on their taxes. If you are attempting to split custody 50\/50, some parents take turns claiming the child every other year, that can be formalized in your custody agreement. "}
{"question":"Texas \n\nI work at a human tissue processing company. I've worked at this place for a long time.

The company was bought by a company with locations all over the world, and the agreement is now that we cannot work at any tissue bank or similar business ANYWHERE in the world. This seems ridiculous, especially since the skills and experience in a job like this are very niche and not really applicable in any other job position.

We have a city ordinance curfew that forbids anyone under 16 to be on the public streets after 11:00pm.\n","answer":" Yes, you can sue the parents for any damage which is not paid by your insurance.  I would name both parents and child in any lawsuit.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/new-york-parental-responsibility-laws.html\n\nRemember, the first step is to request or demand that your uncompensated costs are paid.

{"question":"My grandmother was looking for someone to help rework her kitchen before expanding it. She found someone on Facebook and he had pictures of past work I guess so she \"hired\" him.\n\nThey met and he charged her an initial $4,000 down payment. Come the following day she can't get ahold of him at all. This continued for a week, now a month. She filed a police report today but was told without a correct name this could go cold.\n\nIs that really it? Can she give them his Facebook or something? $4,000 isn't a terrible loss to her thankfully (was always financially savvy) but it's infuriating someone could do this and get away with it.\n\nFwiw she did do some research into this guy. He had a professional looking site and client reviews we see are now bullshit. So he did LOOK legitimate. His Facebook and website are both gone now.......\n","answer":" How did she pay him (cash, card, check, etc)? Depending on the answer your might have some fraud protections through your bank and it would be worth talking to them.Answer #2: Sounds like a scam. There's a reason why there are so many scammers out there and that's because it's so difficult for the police to pursue them. You can push this up the chain with the police department, but I doubt it will go much further. \n\nIn the future, only hire contractors that are insured and bonded. There are many legitimate websites out there that have reviews for contractors in your area.Answer #3: &gt;Fwiw she did do some research into this guy. He had a professional looking site and client reviews we see are now bullshit. So he did LOOK legitimate.

{"question":"My question is pretty much as my post title states. My wife and I had a baby recently. I missed the enrollment window to add my child to my plan and I am being told I now have to wait until our yearly open enrollment to add my kid. \n\nI am going to take this up with HR and ask for forgiveness for the sake of my newborn, but I'd like to know if there are any relevant laws regarding the legality of refusing to allow the addition of a dependent based on what seems like an arbitrary corporate policy.\n\nThis is in Pennsylvania. \n\nAlso, my wife is a SAHM so we don't have an option on her end for insurance.\n\nThanks\n","answer":" If it's 60 days it's not arbitrary at all nor is it their policy but rather the law. They can't add her once the 60 day window has passed.  You can beg but you have no leg to stand on. 60 days is 60 days.Answer #2: It is likely the insurance company that is not allowing it. Your HR department probably has no control over that whatsoever. Answer #3: Yes they can legally make you wait."}
{"question":"Backstory: I got my two bottom wisdom teeth removed yesterday and today i still have heavy numbness on the left side of my bottom lip and chin.

Some patients have residual issues for months. It’s a risk of surgery. Also you should know that the nerve involved runs from the back of the mouth all the way to the front teeth.

{"question":"He didn't reside with me or lease or anything.  He was just staying the night a few times and put some of his work things in the shed (I didn't know what he put in there).  We broke up and he said he was coming for his things but never did.  I had them on the curb for him the first night.  The next day I moved them to the driveway and covered them with plastic so they wouldn't get stolen or wet.  Today (day 3) everything is still there.  I notified him and his father that the belongings were there waiting and even told them when I wouldn't be home if they wanted to pick them up (my ex said he would prefer to not see me).  I'm wondering how long I have to keep this stuff on my property since he wasn't a tenant and he's not responding to my requests for him to come get it.  It's ladders, lots of painters drop cloths, paint poles and supplies.\nTopic:\nOther Civil Matters\n","answer":" Send him a certified letter saying that he has 15 days to pick up his stuff and after that you'll consider them abandoned. Answer #2: Though he isn't a tenant, you allowed him to store the property. If you're asking can you sell it on CL, that's a good way to get sued. I would put it back in the shed and let him contact you to make arrangements. Since you removed them and left them outside, if they are damaged or stolen, you're liable. Answer #3: Another option is to pay for self-storage, move the stuff into it, give him the key and inform him that a month has been paid for. He can move it or allow the self-storage people auction it off in a month. Change your locks so that he just doesn't let himself back in and call the police if they do break in."}

{"question":"We lost our child while traveling on an international flight from Toronto to Delhi. The child was about 6 months old. He collapsed, and died about 1 hour before the flight landed.\n\nAn autopsy report indicated that cause of death was 'asphyxiation.' The airline said they did a curtsy investigation and did not take any responsibility for the incident. Even their letter on the matter was full of factual errors. My wife and I moved on. However, I wonder if I can still file a case\/writ to:\n\na) Hold the Airline legally accountable\n\nb) Claim compensation for Emotional Harm and Mental Suffering\n\nThe incident happened in June 2008. Is there a statute of limitations ?\n","answer":" Sorry for your loss, but the real question here is how do you think the airline asphyxiated your child?Answer #2: I am terribly sorry for you loss. \n\nIt is highly doubtful there is a theory in which you have not exceeded the statute of limitations to bring a suit. What is more important to consider is if you would have had strong evidence thr airline caused the asphyxiation. The word means loss of breath; how was this due to the airline's negligence? \n\nIf the child had a medical emergency, anyone on the flight who responded would have been a passenger volunteer. Airlines do not keep medical personnel on flights in part to *avoid* this type of liability, but there are ground physicians who give orders and assume medical liability for acts of people who have medical qualification to intervene. They are not airline employees, either. \n\nYou should always speak with an attorney about all relevant facts to be sure, but I suspect this might not be viable to pursue. \n\nAgain, you have my depends condolences.  Answer #3: A claim in Ontario would have had to have been filed within two years of the date the claim arose (Limitations Act 2002, SO 2002, section 4). I expect any claim in Delhi will have the same issue. In short: _even if you have a viable claim_, you've almost certainly waited too long.\n\nSpeak to an attorney to be sure, but I am not optimistic."}

{"question":"So I just got a new job at a tutoring company in upstate New York (test prep for ACT\/SAT mostly) and when I tell people they will call me in and pay me for just an hour a day, some point out that it might not be legal. I'm unfamiliar with these kinds of laws. So is it legal to call an employee in for a single hour shift?\n","answer":" It's not illegal, it's just part of the tutoring game. As someone who has tutored, my advice is up your clients and pack your schedule as best you can. Realistically, get a part-time job and limit your tutoring hours to the peak times. I don't know anyone who has managed to tutor full-time, since most families can only afford 1-2 hours a week and there's heavy competition. \n\nA 20hr\/week job supplements your income nicely, and enables you to fill those pesky non-peak hours, like weekdays. Odds are, you won't lose many clients by cutting those hours out entirely. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, if you're allowed to set your own rate, don't undercut everyone. The reason tutoring prices are inflated is because many of them are self-employed, which has lots of tax implications and comes with the side effect of having very strange schedules. Also, the inconvenience of being hired in 1-2 hour increments is included in the price. I charged $35\/hr while working retail for $8\/hr part time. I rarely worked more than 5 tutoring hours a week."}

Would your records be immediately sealed or something?\n","answer":" My understanding in most jurisdictions is that, if you would have been charged as a minor at the time the crime was committed, you will still be charged that way even if you are an adult at the time of the arrest. \n\nAlso: the statute of limitations for most felonies is Connecticut is 5 years. So, if the theft happened more than 5 years before the arrest, they cannot prosecute."}
{"question":"Hey all, I was wondering if somebody could perhaps help provide me with some insight. So I recently found out that my cousin was arrested twice within the past year in New York. \n\nFor the first arrest he was charged with PL 155.35 01 and PL 170.10 01 . The second more recent arrest was a single charge of PL 155.35 01 .\n\nHe really hasn't been providing information on what happened but some family members think it could be the result of passing bad checks. I was hoping if somebody could enlighten me on if that would make sense? \n\nThank you!\n","answer":" Grand larceny. And if he doesn't want to talk about it that's his business and probably the smart thing to do."}
{"question":"from my roamings of r\/legaladvice, It appears outside a sperm bank it is impossible to sign away any connection to a child whatsoever. Even if the mother doesnt pursue child support, any state aid has a bill go to the father  (or mother, whatever)\n\nwhat happens in porn? birth control isnt 100% effective and Im sure abortons are common. but if the new starlet wishes to keep the child is the other actor on the hook? do they have porn baby insurance in case it happens? \n\nIve googled this and found less than informative responses. \n","answer":" Generally, they get an abortion. Professional pornographic actors have a personal interest in their own reproductive health for a bunch of mostly-obvious personal _and_ professional reasons, and an unplanned pregnancy is a big deal.\n\nIf they carry the child to term, there's nothing particularly magic about being a porn star. If they don't know who the father is, they can seek paternity tests. If the state wants to seek support on their behalf, the state can subpoena the mother for the list of candidate fathers. It doesn't matter if that's one man or hundreds.\n\nIf the child is born and paternity can be established, the father is on the hook. There are no insurance plans that cover 18 years of child-rearing expenses for porn stars.Answer #2: &gt; if the new starlet wishes to keep the child is the other actor on the hook?\n\nYes, and I'm aware of at least a few instances of this happening. In at least one of them, the two performers got married soon after and are still together today."}

{"question":"I have sister of 25 years of age with a severe learning disability who is also nonverbal. She was admitted tonight at a hospital for a kidney infection and stones. My mother and I share her conservatorship for many things, including her medical decisions, which we thought meant our mother could stay and watch her for signs of pain or needing attention from the nurses. We learned no one could stay with her due to rules they have in the hospital. We explained she would not be able to call for a nurse or tell someone if something hurts or if she needs assistance, but we were still informed that they couldn’t allow it. I am a non confrontational person, but I do worry I didn’t fight enough to make sure my mother could stay and help her overnight. Do we have a right to stay with her and assist her and make the medical decisions I’m sure will be needed overnight? Or does the hospital’s policy trump our Letter of Conservatorship? This is in California. \n","answer":" You should contact the patient advocate or the social worker at the hospital to walk you through precisely what your rights are, and they may also help you navigate what's best for your sister. Answer #2: They may not allow you to stay, but your Dr should be able to write an order for a sitter. That would be for a hospital employee to stay with the patient all night and alert the nurses if something is wrong. "}
{"question":"This was my first apartment, I alone can afford the apartment, he makes half as much as I do. We broke up and forced me out, but now he is saying that he will not sign me off the lease. \n\nMainly because if he tanks the place or can't make rent he wants the repercussions to fall on me as well. I have already contacted the landlord and told her about my situation. He is supposedly moving his friend in, but did not tell the landlord (I did).\n\nHe also is trying to keep my cat. I have insurance on him, but that is all the paper work I have showing ownership (he is a rescue\/was a stray). I am really stressed out, and don't know what to do. I am living with my aunt until I can get back on my feet, and I have no idea what to do about this.\n\nI am in NE Ohio, USA\n","answer":" You have this all wrong.\n\nThe lease is between both of you (co-tenants) and the landlord.  You have already broken the lease by moving out (never mind the valid circumstances).  Do not confuse being in an abusive situation with having a legal contract with another party automatically broken.  Thing's don't work that way. \n\nYour landlord has the ability to remove you from the lease, NOT your ex-boyfriend.\n\nAs long as you are on the lease, yes, you can be sued for the rent by either your landlord or your ex. \n\nYou can't be evicted by a co-tenant.  I think leaving an abusive person was smart, but in the USA, you can't be evicted without a court order.  \n\nAsk your landlord for an amendment to your original lease, releasing you from the lease.  They may or may not want to do this because having you on the lease makes you financially responsible for the term of the lease.  \n\n\"Telling\" people does nothing.  What is signed on the dotted line or is in writing is what counts.Answer #2: He is not required to sign you off. Your landlord would likely not allow it anyway if he makes so much less. \n\nBut if you have proof that you were *forced* out and not just that you left due to the relationship ending, you might have a defense in court if he sues you. You would also want to get proof of his friend moving in. Both those things could keep you from having to pay anything. "}
{"question":"I work fast food. I rung up some ice cream that we sell and got a cup of root beer for free (which they allow us to do) and mixed them together to make a root beer float because it’s about 50¢ cheaper than ringing it up normally and I get more ice cream.\n\nMy manager saw this and told me that I was stealing by not ringing it up as a root beer float. My argument is that I paid for the ice cream and they allow us to have drinks for free so it’d be the same as if I went into a grocery store that sold sandwiches and bought some bread and condiments and just made a sandwich from those because it costs less.\n\nWho’s in the wrong in this situation?\nTopic:\nCriminal Law\n","answer":" Boss is wrong.

I'm sure that it doesn't work like that, since most apartments with a \"no pets\" policy have them for a reason. \n\nSo could we get in anywhere? Also, would my SO be part of a protected class since she has the dog because of a mental disability?\n\nAsking mostly out of curiosity.\n","answer":" Under HUD guidelines her dog is protected by the fair housing act, however it sounds like it is not a service dog as defined by the ADA.\n\nFHA does not apply in all circumstances,such as, if you are renting a private home directly from the owner (not listed by a real estate agent) or if you art renting a room in someone's home, or if you are renting a unit in a 4 unit or smaller building and the owner lives in one of the units.\n\nThe FHA also does not apply to motels or other public accommodations "}
{"question":"So my car was rear ended and the trunk door was pretty messed up. It still closes and the damage is purely cosmetic, and drives as it always has. It's an old vehicle, however, and the repair costs bumped it over into the total loss category. \n\nI understand I need to apply for a salvage title and then rebuild title to keep driving it legally, but the DC DMV website says I must apply for a salvage title within 30 days.

Thank you.\n","answer":" Disappearing is not, in and of itself, a sign your kid is in danger.

{"question":"In Jan 2013 we were halfway through a pregnancy and my wifes parents health insurance company, Blue Shield, switched from california to texas.

We couldn't apply for a new health insurance because once again pre-exisiting condition.

In addition, exclusions cannot apply to a newborn, an adopted child under age 18, or a child under age 18 placed with a family or individual for adoption, as long as the child became covered under creditable coverage within 30 days of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption and does not incur a subsequent 63-day break in coverage.\n\nSo in theory this does not sound kosher to me, but it sounds like there could also be more to the story than is apparent here. For starters, it's not really accurate to characterize what happened as a \"drop\" since it sounds like the plan was actually switched, rather than terminated.\n\nFor purposes of pre-existing conditions that shouldn't make a difference since we're talking about pregnancy, but it simply makes me question whether there is actually a different issue. For example, if she met her deductible on the previous insurance but has now changed plans, perhaps her maternity coverage is not yet kicking in. But that would be a deductible issue, not a pre-existing condition issue."}

He's been known to take off work because of his stomach problem, which was fine in the past. He went to the lake on the 4th with his family and returned to work today (the 5th), and his boss confronted him saying he had someone with pictures of him and his family at the lake; he was asking why was he there when he took a day off for being sick. I know there's laws for privacy in Georgia, but I'm not sure if that was breaking any due to it being a public area. \n","answer":" It’s not illegal to take pictures in public.

{"question":"I live in a complex with about 15 or so buildings (8 people per building), and we have cops that sit there every day in the visitor parking. We are not too loud, don't throw block parties or make any sort of big messes. Still, we have these cops out every weekend. At the beginning of the semester (each semester) there are about 4 out every Friday and Saturday night. One has a dog that patrols the area. I was playing basketball on our court at 11:00 pm on a Friday night and a cop drove by and told us that the court was closed (at 10:00), but there is no sign saying that. We had a cop come up to our upstairs neighbors and told them they were being too loud. (2 girls drinking, while we, 4 guys, were down stairs playing music and screaming while playing Fifa).

When someone calls and complains that you're being too loud.\n\nNothing you wrote makes me think the officers are acting improperly.  Talk to your apartment complex- it's likely that they are requesting the presence. Answer #2: The police are there likely because of a lot of complaints coming from other residents. Yes, the complex can allow the police to enforce the law.\nFrankly you sound like you are in a college apartment building and I have a feeling that your idea of being quiet and neighborly doesn't line up with most of societies idea.\n\n\nPlaying basketball at 11pm would drive me insane. that's not a quiet sport.

He might also try animal control in that area. If all else fails he will have to go to court.Answer #2: Did D get the dog  microchipped? It is notoriously hard to get the police to return a stolen pet. If the dog was some sort of expensive bread with paperwork D may be able to sue Cindy for the cost of a replacement (or best case scenario scare Cindy into giving the dog back).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than that, if D can somehow get possession of the dog back, the police would likely not return the dog to Cindy.

For myself, if some kid was arrested for misdemeanor possession and had no criminal history or other aggravating factors, I'd be pretty inclined to not recommend jail time.  I would probably entertain the idea of some probation time and maybe community service.  \n\nHUGE DISCLAIMER: that is just applicable to me and my jurisdiction.  I assume this is a city of Columbia case, and I can't speak at all for their prosecutor's position on marijuana possession.  Each jurisdiction and prosecutor have their own quirks.  That is why you should contact a defense attorney in Columbia. They are going to know how to deal with the prosecutor and what a typical punishment is.  \n\nKeep in mind that anything within the maximum sentence could happen- unlikely, but still possible.  This is serious enough that you'll need to get your parents involved.  Someone else down the thread recommended going to court and just being honest.  Please don't do this.  At that point you are just putting yourself at the mercy of the court.  In some extreme cases, you'll get a sympathetic prosecutor and judge, but I would never advise anyone to take that risk without some knowledge of how that jurisdiction generally operates."}

Is there anything beneficial that would result in an outcome to this scenario other than being given a break and workplace ostracization? \n","answer":" You need to ask for your break or take it. There is clearly a policy in place that allows you to take it. You need to be proactive. It's not their fault if they told you to take a break and you didn't. "}

{"question":"My girlfriend just got back home from buying a kitten off of her friends coworker. Apparently coworker has cat alergies and her and her boyfriend agreed they wanted to get rid of the cat.

What happens if she refuses to give it back? She's worried about them taking legal action but I figured it's a sale, she paid, and there's conversation between them beforehand where they talk about making the deal. We're in Orlando, Florida.\n","answer":" Does she have a receipt? Are there texts from the former owner saying something to the effect of having changed her mind?Answer #2: I dont think this is so much a legal issue as it is a \"dont be a jerk\" issue.  She should be the better person and give the kitten back.  As its been said, she only had the cat for an hour, versus the bond the coworker obviously made.  If it means that much to the coworker to have the kitten, just be kind and do it.  Sure, its annoying and yes its inconvenient, but there are other kittens.  Plenty of shelter cats would love a person to own."}
{"question":"So I'm a summer intern at Columbus, OH and I came from Turkey for just this summer ( with J1 visa ). I found this place on craigslist and we signed a lease.

My wife was brought to the United States illegally when she was two years old, and we were beginning the process of trying to get her a green card when we hit a brick wall.  \n\nEvidently you cannot even apply for one if you came to the country illegally, and the Immigration Services office is telling us that she is going to have to return to Mexico and apply for a Visa there.

{"question":"I have been recently thinking about moving to Pennsylvania with my fiancé l,9year old son, and 3 month old baby. My 9 year old son is not my fiancé real son but he cares for him like his own. I currently live in Florida and 9 year old son occasionally  visits his father. When I say occasionally I mean once every blue moon. I have already brought up that I want to move but he wasn’t having it and was like “yeah I don’t think that is going to work and that I can’t do it.” I need some serious advice on what to do because I want to leave Florida by next year.\n","answer":" Well sorry to disappoint you but this likely won't happen as quick and as simple as you want it to happen.\n\nHere's the problem. You currently probably have a court order regarding visitation and it's highly unlikely if it would say that you are allowed to move outside of the jurisdiction that it was established in without your son's father's permission.\n\nIf you don't have an court order or if you move even without a court order that doesn't say anything then he would have some time to take you to court and the court would pretty much force the return of your son to Florida. \n\nSo right now it's time to talk to a family law attorney in your state to petition the courts to set up a parrenting plan allowing you to move to Pennsylvania with your son (and you would have to show that it's in your son's best interest to move to Pennsylvania). If the courts say that he can't be taken out of the jurisdiction then that move won't happen (or you would have to leave your son behind)."}

{"question":"I live in California and my friends bf has been arrested and has a bail of $25,000 what are his options since he doesn’t have the money. Can he pay in small payments? What does a bail bondsman do? Does he need a lawyer? Also what are a minors options to not be at home. What does it take to get emancipated?\n","answer":" Jesus, one thing at a time.  \n\n\nBail is an amount of money used by courts to guarantee a person will show up for a court date.  Most of the time you hire a bail bondsman, and they will charge you 10% the cost of your bond to bail you out.  However if you have the full amount you can make your own bail.  However it sounds like you don’t, you’ll just have to call and see what bail bondsmen are willing to do for payments, some might want a down payment, some might not, some might not want your business at all.  \n\n\nSo basically you’re looking at $2500, maybe they’ll let you make payments, maybe not.  However, your friend doesn’t have to make bail and can stay in jail if you don’t have the funds."}

{"question":"After signing up for a driving school , the instructor announced that they would be holding onto our phones during the class. We were not informed of this before signing up for the class.

We are later dismissed in groups, and we can grab our phone from the box on our way out of the building.

Anything wrong with me just selling these ladies some Sigmas that I cut out of special cloth and serged for them? \n\nIs it legal to sell a Greek organization letters since it's \"just letters?\" so long as I sell them individual letters and not any particular combination (even if they pick out a certain 2-3 letters)? \n\n*Edited a little to condense. \n","answer":" You can't put them on a product to sell, so just customizing some letters for her is perfectly fine.

She dated a lieutenant on the force.\n\nDon't persist in this sort of conspiracy theory talk because it's a non-starter.  If the hospital (doctor) felt that she wasn't an immediate danger to herself or others, then they had to let her go.  The police won't sit around your house waiting for her to maybe show up.  If she comes over and is causing a problem, then you can call the police.  If you think that she is a danger to herself or others, then you can try to get her committed for a psych evaluation.

{"question":"I recently bought my dream car (Dodge viper ACR) and for those of you who aren't car people, it has an 8.4l V10. Today, the president of my HOA says I have to sell my car because of an archaic law in the HOA that states that vehicles with engines having more than 6 cylinders are not allowed. \n\nApparently, years ago the HOA had trouble with \"street racing\" and thus the law was put into place.

Answer #6: I had to go to jury duty yesterday. 5 people out of the 50 that were scheduled didn't show. If you still live in the same county that you got summoned in just call and explain. If you did nothing I think you would be safe too. That is why they bring in 50 and only select 13. Answer #7: Do not ignore this.

Is there a statute somewhere that states the maximum depth I can dig or the maximum volume of sand I can move before I'm performing construction and not just playing in the sand?\n","answer":" This has got to be the best question asked on this subreddit, ever. \n\nI'm both highly amused and in desperate need of an answer. Answer #2: Let's say you didn't use a bobcat, but an army of kids instead. Because I'm sure a line would be drawn somewhere before a bobcat.Answer #3: It definitely depends upon the location, but I don’t think in most places digging requires a permit. Even the “Call before you dig” thing isn’t a requirement, just a really, really good idea. As soon as you put in a “structure” you’d start to need a permit. \n\nThere’s also “sand dune” and bird\/turtle habitat considerations which might make digging (of any sort) illegal. \n\nEvery year, I hear of at least 1 person who ends up injured or dead because they were digging a hole and it collapsed on them, so the practical limit is knee-height. Answer #4: In panama city beach metal shovels are outlawed and holes can’t be deeper than 2 feet. It’s one of the laws the implemented after the 2015 spring break thing there. \n\nhttps:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/simpleview\/image\/upload\/v1\/clients\/panamacitybeach\/PCBPD_RackCard_v1_1_9319acf1-9d57-4e18-9cff-3efb04335767.pdfAnswer #5: Is it your beach, or a public beach?  \nIn the tidelands?  \nAbove the ordinary high water mark?  \nAbove the Extreme high water mark?\n\nIn my state, most beaches have prohibitions against motor vehicles, so the bobcat would be out. Some beaches are considered state highways, so you could legally drive the bobcat onto the beach, but digging COULD be considered illegal, since you are fucking with a highway.\n\nI think we need a professional in sand-law.Answer #6: My beach prohibits motorized vehicles, so you'd have to ditch the bobcat\/bulldozer. That's true of most beaches in my state (Florida). \n\nI'm not having much luck figuring out when you'd have to stop manually digging\/landscaping, though."}
{"question":"Exactly as the title says, professor caught best friend and I cheating on the exam. Basically, we made a code and were tapping and writing numbers on each other’s thighs. We didn’t think she would notice (obviously) but she did and we immediately failed the exam and she told us both to come in and talk to the head of department. I told her that we didn’t cheat and we were just touching each other’s legs. Also, I switched exams (they had both A &amp; B) to have the same exam as my friend, sitting next to me. \n\nHELP? What do you think will happen? Will I be able to get my actual grade for the exam or will I be stuck with a zero? \n","answer":" He didn't catch I. He caught me. He caught my best friend and me cheating on an exam.\n\nYou're likely to get zero on the exam. Be happy you weren't kicked out of the course. \n\nWhat's your legal question?Answer #2: Probably fail the exam, and, worst-case scenario, face expulsion, or at the least, some kind of disciplinary action.\n\nThis isn't a legal issue.  You're at the mercy of your school.\n\nNon-legal, life advice: you're pissing money away by cheating; even worse if it's your parents' money.  If you don't want an education, drop out and save yourself or your parents that money.  If you do want an education, learn the shit and do it yourself.Answer #3: You cheated. You were caught. This happened in a university, you have no legal remedy. The university has a vested interest in having and enforcing academic integrity policies, and in the course of doing this you were legitimately caught cheating on an exam. \n\nYou could easily be expelled. You can do nothing but beg.Answer #4: If you're lucky, you'll just fail the class.\n\nIf you're not, you'll get expelled. \n\nMost school have policies on how to handle cheating, detailed in student handbooks or similar resources. I advise you to familiarize yourself with your school's cheating policy."}

{"question":"Hello everyone.  My parents currently live in GA, and I tend to cover their HOA fees, as they're having a tough time covering more than the mortgage + util.  \n\nI recently found out that the HOA fees went up $50 a month, for 6 months, for a \"special assessment fee.\"  I inquired what this was for, and I was told that a homeowner had brought against them and the developer a lawsuit for a pond, and to cover the lawyer fees, the homeowners have to cough up $300 extra.\n\nIs this legal?  I don't even have the by-laws on me, so I have no idea if they're allowed to do this.  It seems sketchy to me.\n","answer":" Yup.  This is what happens when an HOA ends up in litigation -- the members pay for it.  $300 is nothing.  They should be happy it's not thousands.Answer #2: Legal and typical.  \"Special Assessments\" are for things that the HOA can not easily predict and budget for, such as legal fees, lawsuit payouts, unforeseen repairs to community structures (more typical in condos I think), and so on.  A lawsuit payouts is something that you should be seriously worried if they start budgeting for."}

{"question":"Sorry if this doesn't fit well in this sub, but I figured it's worth a shot. I just heard on the news that Swift plans to rerecord her last 6 albums so she can have control over them. Would that not fall under any form of copyright laws protecting the original recordings? I'm not really a big Swift fan, however that headline really caught my ear for the legal reason.\n","answer":" You might be interested in the US Copyright Office's circular on musical copyrights, [here](https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/circs\/circ56a.pdf).\n\nIn short, there are generally two different rights at play with music. First, you have the copyright over the composition -- the lyrics and sheet music, for instance. Then you have the copyright over the recording -- the actual master tapes of a particular performance of the composition.\n\nIn this case, presumably the record company owns the copyright to the recordings, but the artist (or at least someone other than the record company) owns the copyright to the compositions. If that's right, then the artist is free to record another performance of the same songs, which might end with her owning the copyright to those new performances.\n\nAll of that is likely spelled out in contracts between the parties (the artist, the composer, the record company, the recording studio, etc.), but given my understanding of entertainment law, it's probably not **clearly** spelled out, so there may well be fights between the parties both in public and in the courtroom.Answer #2: Depends whether she owns the copyright on her compositions, or signed it away to a publisher.\n\nThe copyright on the \"phonorecord\" (original recordings) is irrelevant.Answer #3: Yes, if not she wouldn’t be so sure about doing it.\n\nShe wrote every single one of those songs, which means she owns the copyright. She also said according to her old contract, she’ll be able to re record her old albums starting this November."}

For christ's sake they use old hamburger containers from Walmart for holding the parts we use every day. \n\nBasically, there are presses at my work that take an aluminum or copper tube and flatten one end of it, punch holes in it, and then send it on its way to be washed. It the flattening process, a large amount of oil is needed (we still haven't been told why) and when it gets washed off, the water and oil goes into a basin in the floor. When about 100 gallons of water and oil is collected, it gets pumped into the municipal wastewater  lines and sent out. \n\n\nI'd be extremely surprised if the ground around the building isn't completely contaminated, but when I bring it up, management shuts me down. \n","answer":" If any of that water goes to ocean, lake or river, call Dept.

{"question":"My girlfriend has told me that her employers are going to give her and her coworkers a test to see if they know the job well enough (she works in food service). They say if she or any others don't get 95% or more on this test they will take them out of the tip pool (they pool all the tips together and redistribute them) so any tips she would have gotten would go to others. \n\nDoes this sound legal (we are in California)?

{"question":"My dad owns a property where one of the tenant (2nd Floor) decided to put up a HUGE above ground pool.

I know in the contact we said we will pay for the water, but filling up a 6,000 gallon pool and paying for it is kinda absurd... \n\nThanks in advance - goldmakesmehappy\n","answer":" There are most likely going to be a lot of code problems here and even though the lease doesnt say anything about pools. Doesnt mean they can just build one. For one, with your dad he is now most likely going to have to update his insurance policy to include this new pool. Not to mention the cost to reseed or resode the lawn once it is removed. I would give them a notice to cure (remove the pool). If they do not then evict them and use their security deposit for any costs to remove the pool. There may be nothing about pools in the lease, but the tenant cannot modify a property like this at all.Answer #2: This is a major change to the property, and presents a lot of code and insurance issues. You can certainly demand removal.\n\nIn your lease, do you have any verbiage about billing them for excesses or overages in utility costs?Answer #3: It would be a wise idea for your father to be extremely specific about draining that pool as well.  If not done properly it can damage the home, the yard and possibly adjacent properties.Answer #4: You might be able to ask them to remove it if they don't meet the municipality fence requirements for a pool. You would have to look into that. If you have damages arising from the pool you can sue them or try to go to small claims if it is under the limit. Pool pops and damages the lawn, the building, etc. \n\nIf your lease says you pay for water, you pay for water.\n\nStamford appears to have an online process for applying for a pool, so you can look through the city government for help."}

{"question":"Edit: I probably should have updated shortly after I posted, but I can fully admit that I'm acting like an entitled cow about this. I'm not going to pursue anything and I'm grateful for people being blunt and honest with me.\n\nThank you guys, I appreciate it\n","answer":" If the mere existance of a NICU was enough to cause emotional distress, then they wouldn't exist in the first place. You have no damages, and deserve no compensation other than the unnecessary bills. The fact that the patient was a newborn doesn't mean the misdiagnosis is more damaging. Misdiagnosis is extremely common and not malpractice.Answer #2: You have no damages.  They paid for the expenses of the second hospital. And they escalated in order to make sure your done was treated in a hospital that was better equipped to do the procedure.\n\nYou could pursue it. I honestly doubt you'd be successful.Answer #3: Medical malpractice is extremely fact specific and you need to talk to a lawyer who handles malpractice. That being said, it seems like they absolutely are offering compensation. They are offering to pay all costs associated with the other hospital. It doesn't seem like you have damages here that the other hospital isn't covering. Talk to a med malpractice lawyer to know for sure. "}
{"question":"So i found a webm on 4chan of a video, tryed searching for it if it was on YT already and didnt find anything, i uploaded it to my youtube and monetized it. It got viral within 1 week and got over a million views.\n\nThen i got some people commenting on it that it was fake and stolen and linking to the original (not sure if that one is the original but it was uploaded like 3 months prior). \n\nSo should i just delete the video now? Or what do i do? Do i return the money that i get from youtube somehow? Essentialy i just dont want to face some lawsuit over this.\n","answer":" You do not hold the copyright to the video so by you uploading a copy of it yourself and making money off it you have left yourself open to alot of issues.\n\nIt's also against Youtubes conditions of use which could end up getting your account banned.\n\nReturn the money (If possible?).

{"question":"Father had paid child support for a few years ( maybe 2 ) then moved to another state and stopped paying for the next 16 years. He has two children with my mother, my brother and I. That is why the amount owed is so high. He moved back to Arizona a few years back (The state where all of us live)  Is there anything legally my mother can do about this? We also don't want thousands of dollars in legal fees. He also is a bit of a maniac and I'm worried for my mothers safety if  any legal action was taken against him. Any advice? Again we are in the state of AZ.\n","answer":" You can start by contacting https:\/\/des.az.gov\/services\/child-and-family\/arizona-child-support-services Arizona child support services. If the order for child support was made in the state, then presumably they have a record of it and I am willing to bet would very much like to talk to him.Answer #2: The same thing happened with my dad. He owed my mom 80k in back-pay. We are now 24,22 &amp; 19 and the State took my dad to court when he finally got a real job and now garnish his paycheck. Just know your dad will not get away with this. It will bite him in the ass some day. I would follow the advice you were given, try to alert the right state institution and hope for the best. Him moving out of state did not prevent him from having to pay. They will find him.Answer #3: Ianal but have dealt with child support for my daughter.\n\nThe backpay doesn't go away.  Your mom needs to contact the child support agency and push for action to be taken.  They will follow up!  \n\nDepending on state law he could:\nHave wages garnished if he's working and\/or collect tax returns if he files.\nDriver's license revoked \nJail\n\nUsually when I have had to contact them about next measures if he isn't going to pay it isn't too long before payments resume.

{"question":"So my other post is on here but I'll cut to the chase now. My ex has a RO against me and I found a video on my google drive that was connected to my old phone of her sexually assaulting and raping me in my sleep. I called the police and they are having an officer call me back. She took the footage on my phone while i was asleep. I can't get in trouble for having this footage can I? Should I not report? Please help. The officer should be calling me any minute.  \n","answer":" You're not going to get in trouble. The video was recorded with your personal property and stored on your Google drive. Answer #2: No, you won't get in trouble for having that recording and reporting it. I also read your other post and my other piece of advice is to not miss another court date without warning,  because it really doesn't look good for you. Actually, try not to miss one in general, but if you're once again struck ill on the day of your hearing, its probably smart to go to the doctor and get a note from a professional.

{"question":"So my daughter snuck out of the house the other night and was picked up my an 18 year old male whom we have not allowed to date. It was not a \"we forbid you\" situation. We just simply did not know. She says he asked to come by and she said no. Eventually he convinced her, picked her up and took her to a nearby parking lot. She says they were there for about 30 minutes. She says all they did was talk but I choose to take that with a grain of salt. My question is, do I have any legal recourse? Kidnapping, enticing a minor, custodial interference....anything? And could I potentially get a restraining order? \n","answer":" Your recourse is limited; the closest charge I can recall is Enticing a Minor, which is a class B misdemeanor in Texas. It is doubtful any type of felony was committed (such as kidnapping). And assuming sexual activity between the two of them occured, this would likely not be statutory rape. Although the age of consent in Texas is 17, there's a three year \"Romeo and Juliet\" exception that your daughter and her friend fall within.\n\nWhether or not he can be charged, and the chances of a restraining order surviving the initial hearing, are questions that can be answered by filing a report with your local police department.Answer #2: You can speak to the police, and they may look into it further, and charge him with statutory rape. It would be near impossible to get a restraining order, it's your job to ensure your daughter doesn't leave the house. No kidnapping, custodial interference, etc. Really all you have is a claim for potential statutory rape.  "}

{"question":"My rental agency forgot to put the end lease date in our lease at signing and needs us to re-sign acknowledging the date of the lease termination.

It languished for several months, and eventually the money got returned to me.

There were circumstances back then that made this super illegal (I was 17) that are no longer applicable to me. At that time, I didn't do anything about the situation because 1) I didn't know what to do and 2) I never saw the video but I'm sure it exists\/existed because I saw the \"hidden\" camera set up and thought \"That's a strange way to store a camera.\" Anyway, I've been trying to get back into the dating pool but it's been kind of difficult because I'm scared this will happen again.

You can be clear and honest with the person that you do not consent to be filmed, before you have any sexual contact with them. I mean, if you really wanted, you could get it in writing. Going further, you could always avoid sexual activities until you absolutely trust a person. But I digress and this is getting beyond legal advice. There's not much more you can do from a legal standpoint to avoid this.Answer #2: Not a lawyer but...\n\nI would call the cops. Probably the RI cops since that's where this happened. I'm going to assume you're not the first person he's done this to. If you don't report him, there will probably be more victims to come. It doesn't matter that you're not 17 anymore, he's still committing a serious crime just by possessing that video.

{"question":"Are there limits?\n\nWe're assuming the person being attacked is a celebrity and has reason to lose a lot of money in a civil court.\n","answer":" Let's say I punch you. You can punch back to the extent it is reasonable to defend yourself. At a certain point of you punching back, I may cease to be a threat. If you keep punching after that point, you are no longer defending yourself and are liable for the damage you cause. Of course, it will almost always be factually murky, regarding when you should have stopped punching. "}
{"question":"I myself am not from the USA, but the corporation in question is from America. It´s HQ is in Washington (the state). I have acquired a lawyer in my home country and i´m sure he wouldn't want me to disclose any information about the case here. **I´m just curious about how copyright infringement laws in america work and the procedure for a case like this ?**\n","answer":" This is a copyright infringement.  You can sue them for the amount of profit they made from the infringement and for the amount of money you lost.  If you registered the copyright with the US Copyright Office (such as at copyright.gov) within the proper window, then you can sue them for statutory damages, so you don't have to prove they made any profits off the infringement, nor that you lost any.\n\nYou would sue them in US federal court for copyright infringement.  You need an attorney in the US for a US lawsuit.\n\n"}

{"question":"So there is this guy that gave me chlamydia and didn’t even care that he did. He called me stupid and all sorts of names when I called him out.\n\nEveryone told me to report him to my university health center for spreading STDS and not even caring. \n\nJust my fear is that he will release my nudes. I sent them to him on Snapchat and he later on saved them to camera roll. I asked him why and he said to show him to a friend to join in a threesome  (he wanted to double team with me). He then said the videos got deleted but I do not believe him \n\nI fear that once I complain to school health center, he is going to release my nudes somewhere saying my full name even tho it’s unidentifiable that it’s me \n\nIssue is Snapchat convos gets erased so there is no proof that he has my videos. So Idk if the police would even do anything if there is lack of evidence\n","answer":" The police cannot do anything about something you are afraid might happen but for which you have nothing but a feeling about. If you had anything, a threat to release them, literally anything, you might be able to get a protective order. As it is you have nothing but your feeling.  VA does have a revenge porn law so if he does actually spread them with the intent to “coerce, harass, or intimidate” you, then it would be criminal and you can report that."}
{"question":"Last night I was in a small college town called Athens. I was in a group with about five people in a circle. A cop rolled up and said he smelled marijuana. He searched everyone and didn't find anything. He searched the ground and found a bag of weed. He charged all of us with possession but I didn't even have any on me. I was just there when it was all taken place\n\nHe said I could go plead guilty and go through a diversion program and get let off pretty easy. But I don't want to plead guilty because I'm not. \n\nI need to know a few things:\n1) can he charge us all with possession without finding it on all of us?\n\n2) if he can , should I just plead guilty and pay the fine and do the diversion program to get it off my record.\n\n3) OR should\/can I fight it if I had NOTHING on me but still got charged for a bag on the ground that wasn't mine? \n","answer":" 1) Yes\n\n2) No one can advise you about this without knowing the particulars of your case. You should speak with a lawyer. A drug conviction (which might include a guilty plea) could have very serious consequences such as you losing your ability to apply for or receive student loans or scholarships. \n\n3) See #2Answer #2: Others have mentioned constructive possession but haven't defined it for you, so you may still be confused. The idea is that if you had the ability to exercise dominion and control over the drugs, then the court will \"construe\" that as possession. This is \"constructive\" possession. And it's a common method to charge possession crimes when there isn't actual possession.\n\nBut a lawyer is the best option for you. You may have a case, but we can't judge that for you. Answer #3: Since you didn't provide a location, I'm going to assume you're referring to the one in GA that hosts UGA.\n\n2 - Don't listen to police for legal advice: they don't necessarily have your best interests in mind. What he said may be true, but you should really talk to a lawyer. \n\nAlso, as \/u\/iamequipoised noted: student loans can be affected by a drug conviction. See the FAFSA site, [here](https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/eligibility\/criminal-convictions#drug-convictions). Short version, you're not totally screwed, but you still don't want that to be on your record."}

He said he wanted to sue them for screwing him up, and now he's gone I want to as well. I don't feel justified and these pricks basically killed him by not hitting the right place with the radiation.\n\nI am a minor, so what would my stance be? Would I even have a chance of suing them? I can try and provide medical evidence and reports from our family doctor and the hospital he was in when he died.\n","answer":" this is beyond the scope of this sub, you need to have your mom, or your dad's next of kin that's an adult speak with a malpractice attorneyAnswer #2: To successfully sue, you would have to prove that the doctors were negligent with your father's care. \n\nHow do you know they were irradiating the wrong area? Was that disclosed to your father? Or are you assuming because the tumor got larger? For a tumor to grow that much, it was likely a very aggressive cancer. Were they doing other treatments?\n\nYou could find med malpractice lawyers and see if your mom would follow up with them?"}
{"question":"I originally paid 306 for PT classes in November, however I didn't end up using them. At first I was fine with just transferring them over to my father but they didn't allow that, so one of the guys sat me down and told me to write and sign a cancellation notice, which I did. \n\nHowever after checking my cc bank statements I have noticed recurring payments of 196 since January ( I cancelled on December.) \nWhat should I do?

That'll ensure you don't get a ticket for  entering a licensed premise underaged.Answer #2: If there is a law there about being in a bar underage, then yes.\n\nIf he thinks you are possibly underage *and* has reason to suspect you ~~are intoxicated~~ have been drinking, then yes.\n\nIf he has reason to believe that you broke some other law, then yes."}

I thanked him and we parted way. A few hours later the property owner contacted my friend and said that he looked into the anvils value and had changed his mind.

{"question":"if the defense lawyer bring that information to court, will the defense lawyer be subject to disciplinary actions?\n","answer":" It depends on the state... Generally, an attorney cannot disclose client communications (even confessions)... \n\nIn some states, there are exceptions to this rule, with the big one being if there is the potential to obviate future serious injury (or death).  (Some states also allow disclosure of future crimes.)\n\nYou haven't said that was the case here... so, to answer your question... generally, I would expect the attorney would be subject to disciplinary action and or sanction, and may end up with a civil action against him for malpractice.\n\nNOTE however, that an attorney also cannot knowingly allow his client to lie at court... so if you confess, and during testimony are asked if you \"did it\"... and you lie... the attorney would be placed in a very difficult position.  If this happens, I believe the attorney has a duty to request to withdraw from representing you.  While I don't believe he can specifically say why, it is very likely that the Court will come to understand that the attorney believes you are lying on the stand."}
{"question":"The only people who are supposed to have access to this garage are tenants\/residents, since you either need a remote that opens the garage gate (which is given only to residents who pay for parking), or you need to enter through the building (which requires a key). \n\nI've already filed a police report, and am in the process of making a claim with my renter's insurance. The value of the objects taken is easily over $1,000. However, it seems the property is taking no responsibility for the security of the garage, and did not even seem at all interested in documenting this event.

I'm wondering if since it costs a dollar everytime you run it and I'm in an income based apartment if there's anything I can do to make my landlord replace it. It's only a dollar everytime but over time that's gonna end up being around an extra 100 bucks a year just for laundry and since I'm in an income based apartment that seems pretty crazy. I briefly mentioned it to her a while back and she just said that it sucks but thats how it is. Thinking that maybe I could bring up that just my building alone should be able to afford a new dryer with all the extra we've been paying and I bet the other buildings are the same.\n","answer":" Unless your lease specifies that you only need to run your clothes through once to dry, you're unlikely to get anywhere. They could raise the cost to $2 per cycle if they get a new one (aiming cost per cycle is not mentioned in the lease). \n\nPut fewer clothes in maybe? You can always hang things up to dry in your place, and it may cut the cost. Answer #2: Does your lease promise you laundry?"}

My lawyer will of course give me her own advice but I'd love to hear of any experiences you've had with this. Anything that's worked well for your clients and pitfalls to avoid. \n\nThank you!\n","answer":" Dress in whatever makes you feel strongest. I’d suggest a pant suit or dressy pants and a classy, comfortable sweater.\n\nI would recommend not taking your Ativan. You want to be as mentally sharp as possible, especially when his attorney is questioning you. \n\nGood luck and I admire you for doing this.Answer #2: I recently had to testify at a hearing. Two things were helpful:\n\nOur lawyer sent me questions ahead of time and I wrote down my answers. In the moment, it was helpful to think about what I had written to maintain composure.\n\nWait a few seconds before answering the others sides’ questions to give your lawyer time to object, and time for you to gather yourself before answering. No need to rushAnswer #3: I went through this and I would say take a deep breathe and don’t let them rush you. Speak slowly and take your time. I would also have someone you trust to come sit in the court room for reassurance.  I also had a bucket on the stand just in case because when they wanted details I started to gag and needed to throw up.   It’s ok to cry and you are doing the right thing.

If I were to keep my containers of these in the trunk would it be considered an open container if pulled over? I read that any seal being broken counts as an open container but I could not find out if that was excluding if it was in the trunk\n","answer":" Generally speaking, you can transport alcohol in the trunk of a vehicle legally. Any opened container needs to be closed and put in a compartment in the vehicle the driver could not access while driving.

{"question":"A friend of mine who has pets is having a very difficult time finding a place to live that will allow her two dogs.

They're no longer pets if they're service animals.\n\nCan anyone tell me precisely what is wrong with this? I feel that it's wrong but I can't express why; I don't want to see her actually try to do this and getting any trouble.\n","answer":" Well service animals must be trained to do a specific task to assist with a disability.  ESAs must be “prescribed” by a doctor who is treating you for a disability (typically depression).  And both are subject to being reasonable, so you cannot just say I get multiple animals.  Yes, that’s terrible advice that is likely to get her evicted.Answer #2: Yes let's lie and take advantage of laws designed to protect the needs of disabled people."}

Tell your friend to stand by to have her life spun out of control by forces which very few people here can begin to understand.  His career is over, btw.  Once the accusation goes out, even if he transfers, the MC is small enough that reputations never truly disappear.  \n\n\nBtw, if you have any other friends who believe they're being raped, every military base in the continental U.S. has no less than three different places they can go to consult, for free, their options.

But before you consider going the legal route, it's possible that this is something they would consider changing if you just asked. Sometimes schools just use general block lists they download from somewhere without really giving the issue too much thought.Answer #2: Well then shouldn't they change it to block all religious websites, if they can block certain ones or call them a disruption or distracting, then why wouldn't they all be a problem? aren't they just promoting their so-called \"traditional religions\" over the others? \nthis is clearly a way of skirting around the fact that the school systems aren't \"allowed\" to promote religion in the classroom, but they get around it through subliminal acts like this. this is censorship of information and free thought, plain and simple.

Answer #2: BIG OL QUESTION HERE: if you are admitted into an inpatient center for said reason, do you really have zero gun rights?Answer #3: ~~So which state is this?~~ Nevermind, I missed that you said California. I worked as a director’s designee—someone empowered by the county mental health authority to put individuals on hold—and there are multiple steps involved in committing someone. Generally speaking a crisis responder—someone like me, an EMT trained in mental health, or a cop—puts an individual on a hold which enables that individual to be transported to an ER. An ER doc will then need to confirm that the hold is both valid and still necessary. This hold will last up to 72 hours. This can be extended if the individual requires further stabilization. If the person isn’t stable at the end of that period they may be transported to a state mental health facility. Before that happens the individual is again assessed by another mental health clinician (doc or similar) and a court gets involved. Different states will have somewhat difference processes but, in general, you can’t get committed without a number of people, specifically trained docs and a court, confirming that you are a danger to yourself or others. \n\nEdit: [Relevant legislation](https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&amp;sectionNum=5150)\n\nSo, the process I described is more or less how California handles involuntary treatment.

{"question":"So, long story short, I got myself ordained online through the Universal Life Church in order to officiate my brother's wedding (this was in 2012).  He got served with divorce papers last week, even though they had a plan in place to settle things via a mediator.  And she's basically gone nuts, trying to milk him dry.  After hearing everything she's trying to get out of him, I told him he should try to get a lawyer to challenge the validity of the marriage given that I'm not really a minister.  (I have also seen some articles online about how some of the marriages that were performed by \"ordained\" ministers from ULC have been challenged in courts and found to be invalid.)

{"question":"I'm interested in knowing some of the specifics for spousal obligation for student loans. I racked up substantial debt in undergrad and grad school to the tune of around 300k. I married my spouse right before grad school started. \n\nWe both decided to have children a few years ago, and that I would be the caretaker. I live in the state of Maryland, and will move to Ohio in a few years. From what I understand these states do not have shared debt laws, meaning my debts are mine and mine alone. Does the state where the loans were accrued matter or just the state of residency?\n\nSo, if I make no more income for the rest of my life, can I just not repay the loans? I know I have to keep my assets low, but how separate do a married couple's finances have to be so that one is not liable for the debt of the other? If a couple has separate banking and files taxes separately, are they protected? Or is that even necessary? Thanks!\n","answer":" Why did you borrow 300k not to have any income the rest of your life?  If these are private loans they can come after your life insurance some day when you die. You will also have absolutely abysmal credit which can harm you in ways you may not realize. Do you think this is setting a good example for your kids? What happens if your spouse dies or is hurt and can't work? Let's say your spouse dies and you get life insurance proceeds. The second it hits your bank account it can be levied. This is a very irresponsible plan for a number of reasons."}

Before we continue, you must affirm that you are not recording this call.\" At that point I realized they knew they were doing something dodgy.Answer #3: Sure. Businesses can refuse service for any non-discriminatory reason.Answer #4: I have personally told more than one person they weren't allowed to clearly take pictures of the set up and merchandise at a store I used to manage. It was a high end niche shop, so people would come to steal ideas and vendors.Answer #5: There are plenty of places, especially in design or art stores, that have signs of no pictures allowed.

{"question":"First time posting here and on my phone so I apologize ahead of time. We live in Kansas City Missouri if that helps\n\nMy brother has been working for a bakery for awhile now, and often works over 40hrs and gets OT. Recently they told him that he essentially has two jobs now working for two different \"companies\", same place, same things he's been doing, but now he's been informed he will receive two paychecks. This will mean no more OT for him, which obviously is a problem. Can they just tell him his job is now split? What can he do (other than obviously getting a less shady job)\n","answer":" Yeah, that doesn't fly.  Federal labor law says that \"employment by one employer is not completely disassociated from employment by the other employer(s), all of the employee's work for all of the joint employers during the workweek is considered as one employment for purposes of the Act.\"  So you can't split hours between two closely related companies to avoid paying OT.\n\nBasically, they're trying to run-around labor law, and it's illegal.  Contact your local department of labor and they should help you with this issue.Answer #2: They have actually said it will reduce\/eliminate OT??

He is now threatening to sue me under squatter's rights so he can stay longer.

I also have 3 other roomates. He's asking me for a 30 days notice note. Can he sue me?\n","answer":" \"Squatters' rights\" isn't a legal theory, and he won't get anywhere with that, but he _is_ your tenant, you _are_ his landlord, and you do have to give him 30 days' written notice to end his tenancy, not 27 days' verbal notice.\n\n\"Squatters' rights\" is a half-understood, poorly-remembered mish-mash of ideas, mixed up with the idea that tenants must be evicted in particular ways (which is true) and that an open and hostile occupant of a property can come to own that property (true in _very limited ways_, but the time frames involved are on the scale of years to decades, and it's irrelevant to your situation).Answer #2: He's asking for 30 days notice to move?\n\nThat's pretty reasonable, and is in fact what the law allows for evicting someone on a month to month verbal lease. \nHe has tenancy even if he's not paying rent."}

{"question":"(CA) I signed a lease for a studio apartment in November 2017, lasting for one year. The terms of the lease stipulate that dogs and cats are allowed for an extra price of 50\/month per animal. A week or so ago I adopted an adult golden retriever, and informed my landlord. She said great, you can pay me $600 next time you pay rent. I told her that since I just now got a dog, I should only have to pay for March-November 2018, not the previous months where I didn’t have a dog. She responded by saying that if I didn’t pay the full 600, I would be evicted. Is she in her right to do this, and should I just pay the full amount? Or am I correct in assuming I should only have to pay for the months I’ve had and will have a pet? Thanks in advance. \nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" If it specifies per month, it would be $50 from the month you got the dog. If it specifies just a flat $600 then your next rent you must pay an extra $600. If it specified $600 over the course of the lease, you would pay $600 divided by the remaining months per month extra.\n\nYou would almost certainly win in court if it is the former wording.

{"question":"I am trying to create a mobile app to sell college textbooks. Students will go to my app and choose school, choose specific class, and the app will show amazon affiliate link to buy a textbook that is required for that specific book. My legal question is, does the syllabus that professors provide to their students a public information, or is it copyrighted? Basically can the college\/university sue me since I am basically competing with their book stores? Do they have any legal grounds to do so?\n","answer":" You've got no legal issue, but I'm not sure what your app does that Chegg, Amazon, or school websites or local college bookstores don't already do. \n\nI mean, why would someone trust that your website is accurately giving them the books for their class? How would you collect all that information in a timely manner? Answer #2: It's legal to sell textbooks. Lots of places do. The syllabus is copyrighted (except possibly in the case of public universities), but copyright only prohibits you from copying it. It does not prohibit you from reading it and using the information in it. I.e., it is illegal for you to download the syllabus and host it on your own server. It is not illegal to have a listing on your website that says Professor X requires textbook Y, even if you gleaned this information from the syllabus."}
{"question":"So I went to court today for my unlawful detainer eviction and the landlord’s lawyer lied.\n\nThey said that I was screaming at my girlfriend “I’ll kill you bitch!” and that i went around to my neighbors threatening them.

{"question":"So I recently took up a night shift job a little over a month ago. During the process of filling out the paperwork for it, right towards the end they made me sign a paper saying that if I quit before 90 days I would be charged 300 dollars for the \"training.\" The training consisted of watching a 4 hour video from the 80's that was clearly outdated. I found that this job really isn't for me and spring quarter for college is coming up and I need to leave this job before I can go to school. My question is, if I quit the job after cashing my last paycheck and letting them know that I won't be showing up to work that day will they lawyer up and come after me? \n\nEdit: Just realized that due to how scheduling is, taking the money and running isn't even possible. Either way they can screw me out of 300 bucks.\nTopic:\nLabor Law\n","answer":" We can't say what they will or won't do.  However, clauses like this are very, very common, and will likely hold up if they do come after you."}
{"question":"I live in CA, USA. I have had a trust fund since birth set up to pay for my siblings and mine medical bills, school bills etc. Up until now they have had no problems. Recently, the person appointed to manage the fund i.e. cuts the checks, has had a condition where they have been unable to perform any of the managing duties. My family agrees the trust management has been unofficially taken over by the trust manager's daughter, whom has potentially been signing checks in the name of her parent. Since this change, the trust has failed to pay for some valid, necessary expenses (dental bills, tuition, medical) . They don't dispute that they should pay it, they just don't respond or continually say 'its coming.' They're pretty behind. I'm not sure if there is money to pay it in the trust or not. I have also been unable to obtain a copy of the charter, which my family has been trying to get for over a year.\n\nWhere do I start?\nTopic:\nWills Trusts and Estates\n","answer":" &gt;Where do I start?\n\nAn attorney of some sort sounds warranted here. Or some sort of fiduciary expert with knowledge of trustfund management.Answer #2: You need a copy of the trust. Usually there is a provision for a successor trustee in the event that the trustee is unable to serve. Answer #3: Allowing the daughter to operate in this capacity is untenable.  You need to figure out if the trust designates a successor trustee.  This is especially important since you mention writing checks in the trustee's name.  If you mean the daughter is forging their signature, this is fraud.Answer #4: you should be concerned that the daughter is looting the fundAnswer #5: Financial advisor here! First, as a beneficiary you are entitled to a copy of the trust agreement (the document that explains everything about the trust), which will include a section about primary trustees and contingent (secondary) trustees that should take over due to the primary's incapacity. It is unlikely (not impossible) that the trustee's daughter would take over those responsibilities, although there could be a provision for handing those responsibilities over to a qualified replacement. A few questions:\n\n1. Where is the trust held? When you get checks for expenses, what bank's name is on them?\n\n2. Can you give us a brief outline of the trust's formation? Ex: \"Upon my grandfather's death, an irrevocable trust was set up to pay for his grandchildren's education and medical expenses.\"\n\n3. What is the relationship between the grantor (creator of the trust) and the trustee (manager who pays it out).\n\n4. In what way is the successor trustee qualified to manage the trust? Are the father and daughter in business together as financial advisors\/lawyers\/etc. or is this just a friend of the family?"}

{"question":"Last year I purchased a residence in North Dakota. One of the features in the real estate listing was a 14x20 shop. I found out this year that the shop is not actually on the property I purchased, but is in fact just over the property line on a parcel owned by another individual who has no connection to this issue.\n\nDo I have any recourse to file against the previous owner to either pay to have the shop moved to the property I actually purchased from her (it's a permanent structure that will be a challenge to move), or to pay for the purchase of the parcel the shed is on?\n\nThank you for your time and any advice you can give.\n","answer":" Unfortunately, no. The listing is an advertisement asking for an offer. You (or the seller) likely provided a formal offer to purchase to the other which identified the property. The other party signed it, and then after a period of time, you proceeded with the closing. The offer to purchase likely had a legal description of the property or a tax parcel identification number. A title company probably provided you (the buyer) with a title insurance policy that had a full legal description of the property subject to the sale. The title insurance assures you that you are indeed getting good title, but only for the property described in the legal description.\n\nThe problem is likely that the legal descriptions of the property in the offer and the title insurance policy did not include the area where the structure resides. It would be very difficult to argue that the deal actually included the area where the shed resides due to the listing.\n\n(I am a real estate attorney in Wisconsin, but you should seek local counsel if you want legal advice.)"}
{"question":"Can they do anything?

A retired officer has no more pull than a regular citzenAnswer #2: A retired police officer has as much authority as a retired president, which is to say none.Answer #3: That retired officer is allowed under federal law to carry a concealed weapon in other states.\n\nBut he has no authority or arrest power at all beyond what you do.Answer #4: If this retired police officer is attempting to demand something &amp; claims he can arrest you just call the actual cops next time. The cops should be able to sort it out.Answer #5: You mention demands? I am no lawyer, but that seems like something on the less moral side of things, and might even be illegal depending on circumstancesAnswer #6: &gt;If I disagree his demands\n\nWhat demands?Answer #7: The only powers a retired California Police Officer has in Nevada, or California, are a federal carve-out for concealed-carry gun laws that cover most situations (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Law_Enforcement_Officers_Safety_Act) \n\nThe only reciprocity they have is also for gun-laws -- allowing them to do concealed carry in partner states where the LEOSA doesn't have a carve-out for that type of property.\n\nThere is a simple solution to fix this through: I would call your LOCAL police department's non-emergency line and tell them that a RETIRED Police Officer from California is claiming to have the power of an active Nevada Police Officer and what you should do if he starts giving \"lawful orders\".  My guess is that they will tell you to call 911 and report someone impersonating a police officer."}
{"question":"A person has a past wet and reckless conviction. Say this person goes out to have 3-4 drinks, ends up driving home and gets pulled over for suspicious driving. If BAC were to be borderline high, would it be smart in this persons case to refuse an immediate breathalyzer test and wait to get a test at the station so that BAC may drop below legal limit?\n","answer":" They can ascertain pretty easily what your BAC was at the time you were stopped. It's not like it's hard to calculate how quickly alcohol is removed from your system.\n\nYour question could also be rephrased as \"A person has a history of making poor decisions. If this continues, what are the odds that they're suddenly going to start making smart ones?\"\n\nA previous wet reckless is this person getting lucky. Continuing to push the boundaries means the book is going to get thrown at them the next time this winds up in front of a judge.Answer #2: If this person has had a previous dui, this person should not be drinking that much if they may need to drive home.\n\nThere is no good reason to roll the dice here. If you already have a DUI and are planning on maybe drinking and driving enough to get another you should consider whether you need treatment for alcoholism.\n\nOnly have 1-2 drinks if you may need to drive. The best legal advice is not to drink enough you would be potentially comitting a crime if you might need to drive home."}

{"question":"I am a creative\/graphic designer and I created my own little publication. The local entertainment tabloid (the kind many cities have outside restaurants\/coffee shops) did a article about my creation. It wasn't a review, it was just a little feature on it. \n\nOn the surface level the article reads fairly banal, but -between the lines- I am very cleverly put into a poor light. The article makes me sound like a rube frankly, but without overtly saying anything negative. \n\nI asked this tabloid to remove the article from their website because it comes up when my name is googled and they refuse. \nIs there anything I can do?\n","answer":" &gt;Is there anything I can do?\n\nNo, and to be honest that you would think you can do anything suggests you are slightly a rube when it comes to the publication business."}
{"question":"First time posting here, please let me know if I need to change anything.  \n\nHas anyone here dealt with a Nintendo charger that fried itself in the socket? My son was plugging it in and it popped the breaker and burned his hand, and my wife and I were wondering if we may have a case that we could bring against Nintendo if his hand gets worse. \nTopic:\nPersonal Injury\n","answer":" You're jumping pretty far ahead.\n\nFirst, make sure your son is okay. Get him checked out by a doctor. Keep receipts, but otherwise focus on making sure his burn isn't significant. (If it's healing fine on its own, then you can skip this, but pay attention to how it will affect the next steps.)\n\nThen, contact Nintendo's customer service and explain the situation. They'll almost certainly replace the charger if it's still under warranty, and they may offer to compensate you for your son's injury. If that covers your bills, you're done. If necessary, don't be afraid to escalate to a supervisor or to the company's upper management.\n\nFinally, if that doesn't produce results, you can contemplate a lawsuit. A lawyer specializing in product liability or personal injury is a good idea if your claim is over the small claims limit. u\/jaderust gave you a good rundown on the supporting information you'll likely need, as well, but your lawyer can advise you further.\n\nYou may want to get the outlet inspected by an electrician anyways, but expect to pay that out of your own pocket unless they find some solid indication that the outlet is damaged and that the damage is due to the charger."}

According to the HR person I spoke to, it's their policy.\n","answer":" They have zero obligation to tell you what they said."}

I plan to follow up with him tomorrow morning but I figured I would ask about this here.\n\nHow can a dog-friendly building ban the tenants from letting their dogs pee in the grass?  Do they expect us to drive somewhere?  \n","answer":" Yes, that is legal. A pet building doesn't need to allow the pets who inhabit the building to urinate\/defecate on the property.

You are aware of the dispute over property lines prior to sale, and purchasing without resolution can signal acceptance of the problem."}
{"question":"My friend (26F) was groomed by a male teacher from the age 13-17 (he was 27 at the time it started). He made her share nudes, so he had at some point child pornography in his hands, but he never raped her. The teachers at her school and his wife called her a home wrecker so she never dared to go to court with it at such a young age because she blamed herself. Now she’s scared he’s stilling grooming young girls as he still works at the same school and never actually did apologies for his behaviour. \n\nCan she take this to court, or at least tip of the police about a pedophile?\n","answer":" Do you know if he's still a teacher? You should definitely report him. Police should understand especially in 2019 that a report like this can be acceptably made 15 years later. Especially with the recent scandals where reports took over 30 years to be made( Jimmy Savile, Rolph Harris)Answer #2: Anyone can report a suspected crime to the police, who can forward it on to prosecutors. Based on statute of limitations, strength of evidence (testimony is evidence), and probably other factors I'm not thinking of, the prosecutors may choose to charge him with a crime.Answer #3: In addition to reporting this to police, consider reporting this to the State's Department of Education.  Every state has a board or office that issues licenses to teachers, and they can revoke those licenses for unbecoming conduct."}
{"question":"I am posting on behalf of a friend.\n\nFriend works as a dental assistant and recently had a capped needle break through the side of the cap as she picked it up and it entered her skin. The dentist bent the needle before putting the cap on for some reason. She immediately brought it to attention to the dentists who run the practice. She asked what protocol was because she was obviously concerned. They said they “don’t know” because this “hasn’t happened in years” and brushed it off. Friend tried to confront them again to see if the patient that used the needle in the first place should be tested for bloodborne pathogens and the dentists accused friend of saying the patient is hiding something. Friend had to seek blood tests on her own without help from employer but is still concerned. Is there any legal recourse here? Surely what they’re doing could be considered malpractice. \n\nPennsylvania\nTopic:\nMedicine and Malpractice\n","answer":" With a needle stick injury you should go to the ER as post exposure prophylaxis may be appropriate. It’s unlikely you could require the patient to get a blood test. It would count as a workplace injury not malpractice as your friend isn’t a patient but rather an employee.\n\n\nAs an aside it is bad practice to recap needles as this is when you are most likely to stick yourself, unless you have the type where the cap comes on and off from the side."}

I've never heard of this company so I did some digging and they seem legitimate. They don't seem large, though and I really am not sure what to do. Any ideas? They also sent me a legal document regarding rights but I'm not sure I understand the implications of it. Could use some help. \n\nI am in Eastern Kansas, United States. If  that matters.\n","answer":" Reviewing your contract or telling you what you \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" do is too close to forming an attorney\/client relationship for anyone to really advise you on it. Really, your best option is to go to an attorney with expeience in licensing and digital media. But who does that for a $100 transaction? Absolutely nobody. Maybe there is a more specialized non-legal sub where you can find out about other peoples experience doing this.\n\nThat said, I have a hobby business that generates a lot of similar offers with this piddley contracts with similar terms. The royalty sometimes comes through, sometimes does not. Still I have never looked back and been like \"fuck, I should have just sold it outright.\" You aren't monetizing it anyway, so as long as you aren't giving away your rights to future works or anything like that whats the harm. If it were me, I would probably license it and let them do the work, hope for a little mailbox money but if it never came through or amounted to anything I wouldn't be too upset. "}
{"question":"Hi there! My dad has been a landscaper for 25+ years.  He is getting sued for the first time for $5000 by a client that claims he is responsible for his new dogs urgent care fees. The puppy ate seeds (palm tree little orange seeds) and the owner claims it was my dads fault for not picking up all of the seeds. My dad had recently talked with the client about how he doesn’t work on palm trees but the client still requested it. Unfortunately his dog found some left over palm tree seeds and ate one, leading to his urgent care. The fees ended up being $5000 and he’s suing my dad. What help can my dad get? Does this person have a legit case? Some people need to be more responsible for their expensive puppies. That dog could of ate a grass, tree bark, seeds, dirt and the person would still blame it on my dad being his fault for not keeping his yard perfect for his puppy. \n","answer":" Your dad should consider reporting this to his business insurance.\n\nOtherwise, since the client has filed suit your dad should stop talking to the client and defend himself in court against the claim.Answer #2: The advice you're getting here is great - your dad needs to cut contact and lawyer up if he's getting sued. \n\nOne thing to also consider: If the palm tree is the one I think it is - [like this one](https:\/\/ucanr.edu\/blogs\/blogcore\/postdetail.cfm?postnum=13259) - the orange fruit are actually dates and are edible when ripe (even to people!) Dates are not toxic to dogs. Even if the client's puppy ate a seed, urgent care was likely an overreaction unless the dog was choking or showing some other harmful symptoms. \n\nSo apart from challenging liability, I would also heavily scrutinize the client's damages and the alleged \"harm\" their dog sustained. Answer #3: Because of the claim amount, under $10k - this was likely filed in small claims court. Lawyers are not allowed in small claims, but they can assist you in preparing a response and formulating a strategy. They cannot appear for you. You'll be hard pressed to find an attorney willing to spend time even talking to you for this amount. I recommend trying to find some help at an area law school - they usually have students serve as small claim facilitators. \n\nRegardless he shouldn't have much to fear about this case. Anyone who has palm trees and dogs knows this is a risk. The seeds grow year round, and even if you trim them, there's no guarantee that some won't fall into the yard. "}

{"question":"Location: Wisconsin \n\nFriend worked at a zoo. \n\nThere was literally a short blurb on the employment application that said, \"No cell phone pictures or video's of animals unless approved by owners.\"  \n\nThe pictures she took are of dead animals or animals in a severe state of neglect.  She wants to turn the photos in to the humane society but is scared.  \n\nShe has already lost her job due to reporting the neglect so that isn't the issue.   \n\nWhat legal implications is she facing if she releases the photos using a fake profile?\n\n\n\n\n","answer":" I think this isn't a great idea.  She should report the neglect to appropriate government agencies only, and be very careful what she says in public about the zoo's treatment of the animals there.  If she says false or misleading things she could be sued for libel.\n\nI wouldn't worry about the issue of what was said in the employment application, since she's already been fired."}

What could the father do\n\nChallenge the paternity in court. The court will order a certified DNA test.

{"question":"So my cousin has flat out said he will not pay me $3000 that is owed to me (2 months worth of wages working at his store) and that there is nothing I can do about it. It really feels like there is no way to get that money from him and I am not sure what to do. There is no evidence that I worked for him, either. He just never took my employee information down when we were working for him. Other than a few people who know this (our circle of friends), it feels like there is no way to prove he does actually owe me money and I feel powerless against it. Hoping to get some advice here. This is in the state of Wyoming.\n\n\n","answer":" Your cousin is in a significantly less advantageous position than you. You should not feel powerless. File an unpaid wages claim and watch as you get paid and your cousin ends up being discovered and paying a great deal more than 3000 in back-taxes, penalties, fines, and court costs to keep his store open. Don't forget that you also will need to pay taxes though. If you go legit, you still need to be accountable for all of the income you made under the table. Your cousin is not only screwing over you and the other employees, he is screwing over taxpayers. He needs to make things right, and you should not feel guilty for shining the light on him. It might be wise to have a lawyer help you navigate all of this, but you could potentially handle this all without a lawyer.Answer #2: What state do you live in?Answer #3: Wyoming is a one party consent state.

Some things to know are that he is a citizen of Cuba (where he currently resides) and of Spain. He has passports for both countries. Also, it is a gay relationship (I'm a guy too... not sure if that affects any legal issues).\n\nI'd like to know what to expect. How difficult will it be to keep him here? What kind of costs are we looking at? What do we need to do and how do we start this process? And if there is anything else helpful.\n\n(Edit) I should also note that he is currently in the US visiting family in Miami. I live in Texas so it's a bit of distance. Would it be beneficial to meet up with him to marry or at least meet in person? Would that speed the process up any?\n\nI appreciate everyones time!\nThanks!\n","answer":" Gay marriage to a Cuban?

{"question":"I dont know if this is the right place to post this but I just turned 15 and this afternoon my mum insisted i turn over my phone, computer, wallet and all my passwords to her. She said she wants to link my bank account to hers so she can have control of it, but I know she'll take my money esp. when i move out (she says i have to be out within 6 months of graduation, I graduate in oct 2020). And she wants all passwords not just bank etc. I don't know what else she wants to access. I said no and she yelled at me. She has since gone to work but she says there will be consequences if I dont have everything on the kitchen table with all my passwords written down on a bit of paper before she gets home.

She has never actually hit me or anything but she threatens to sometimes and she takes and destroys my stuff.\n","answer":" No. Your bank details are your bank details and no one is allowed to have possession of them except for you. Unless that account was opened by her for you, then no. She can scream and bitch and moan all she wants, but no. What I will recommend right off the bat is to contact your bank and request an immediate hold on all paper bank mailers to your house for your account. Have them delivered elsewhere. If she's as angry as you say she is, who's to say that she wouldn't go through your mail? Just because you live under her roof, does not mean that she is allowed to demand full access to your banking information. Answer #2: Sketchy AF. Don't give her any details. Hide your debit card.

{"question":"I've moved in this apartment 2 months ago with two cats. I had to pay a $200 non-refundable pet deposit, and a $100 refundable pet deposit. In addition, I'm paying an extra $35 per cat, per month. My therapist is about to register one of my cats as an Emotional Support Animal. From my understanding, landlords are required to waive these fees upon move-in and application, but I've already paid these and these cats were not ESA's at the time.\n\nCan I ask my landlord for the deposits back, and can my pet rents be refunded and waived for the rest of the lease? Therapist is only having one of the cats registered -- would it be trickier if one of the cats is not an ESA? (I didn't think of that, and it might not be too much trouble to register the other one as well).\n\nMost of my knowledge comes from here, especially section 12: https:\/\/www.animallaw.info\/article\/faqs-emotional-support-animals#s2\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" Assuming you already signed a lease and agreed to pay the pet deposit and monthly pet rent, no. Because that is a legal contract you agreed to, and landlords are tracking down and getting stricter with ESA animals. And truly, when it comes to ESA, my understanding is that only one is “allotted”. You shouldn’t need more than one animal to alleviate your “emotional support needs”. Answer #2: Your landlord must make the accommodation *after* you request it, and you paid that deposit and pet rent before you made the request.   \n\nAsking for a refund of the deposits or already-paid pet rent is an absolute non-starter.  There's nothing that suggests that a landlord must make a retroactive accommodation or refund pet rent that was paid according to the terms of your lease.\n\nYour therapist doesn't \"register\" your pets as ESAs;  if she thinks she does, she might not understand the law about psychiatric disability and service animals.   She needs to provide written information to your landlord that you have a psychiatric disability, and that your cats provide treatment for that disability.   If she's using one of those websites that purports to provide official documentation, she's wasting your money.\n\nYour landlord is going to be exceptionally skeptical.   I think they would be justified in refusing the waive the pet rent for a second animal if you somehow provide documentation that only one of your animals provides assistance for your psychiatric disability.\n\nGet your paperwork very clearly sorted before you make this request.   I absolutely would not attempt to ask the landlord to waive your pet rent and then provide documentation that's specific to just one of the cats, rather than focusing on your disability and the accommodations required to treat it with animal companionship."}

{"question":"My vehicle was involved in an a 3 car collision on Thursday. It was rear-ended by a 17 year old girl who had no insurance and had gotten (purchased or was gifted) the vehicle from a family member just the day prior (according to what she said).\n\nThis sent my vehicle into the car in front of it. The damage hasn't been assessed yet, but I'm sure the vehicle is totaled.\n\nWhen the insurance company was called I was informed that I only had liability insurance and that they wouldn't cover any of the damage.\n\nWhat can I do? About anything? I was told that it wasn't possible to only have liability on a car i was making payments on, so how did that happen? Is that just my fault or did someone else somewhere screw up?\n\nThe airbag didn't deploy when my car hit the one in front of it for what that's worth.\n\nI called a lawyer and they will likely be getting back to me on Monday, but I just want some advice on what to expect and what my options are.\n","answer":" Most lenders require you to carry full coverage on vehicles you're still making payments on.   That doesn't mean it's \"impossible\" for you to intentionally buy liability-only, it just means you're violating the terms of your loan and taking on a large risk.\n\nSome lenders, if they discover that you do not have full coverage, will \"force place\" comprehensive and collision coverage on your car and add it to your payments.   They will inform you of this.  It is very expensive.\n\nIt doesn't sound like that's the case with your insurance, but you'll want to talk to them again to be sure.   Get whatever paper records you have that show the \"declarations page\" or insurance card that describes the limits and coverages of your policy.\n\nThe airbag function is immaterial, especially if you weren't injured.   Airbags are designed to trigger in serious front-end collisions, and being rear-ended is the dynamic opposite of that, and airbags typically don't go off in those type of collisions.\n\nIt sounds like your recourse might be to sue the teenage driver and\/or her parents.    If the car had been purchased or gifted from a family member the previous day, it's very possible that person's insurance still covers it because the title paperwork hasn't been applied for yet."}

{"question":"It’s been almost 30 hours since my mom has gone missing. She took my grandpas trucks (which was very low on gas) and had $10. She’s very mentally unstable. We have already called all of the hospitals in the area.. especially the one 1 mile from her house which she is a regular at. We have checked all the surrounding jails rosters and no luck :\/ also logged into her Facebook and found nothing. She doesn’t have a cell phone. We have checked with her only friend. \n\n\nI’m getting really worried now and was wondering what the process is of filing a police report for a stolen truck? Would they arrest her and bring her right to jail and then we would have to pay to get the truck out of impound? How easy is it to drop charges once they find the truck? I feel like police looking for the truck is going to be out last resort and need to move fast.... \n\nForgive me if this isn’t the best subreddit and please direct me to the correct one. Need any advice.\n","answer":" If you report this as a stolen truck, there's a good chance she'll be convicted of theft if she's found alive. Furthermore, you'll prime the police to be expecting a criminal, not a woman in distress. If you're not prepared for that, don't ring that bell - you can't un-ring it, as dropping charges is a choice the prosecutor makes, not a choice you make.\n\nInstead, be honest with the police about your concerns. Thirty hours should be long enough to allow a plain old missing persons report, especially given her history of psychiatric disturbances and the circumstances of her disappearance. You can include that she took the truck without permission if you want, but by framing it this way, it's a lot more likely the police will be looking for someone who needs rescue, not someone who needs arresting."}

{"question":"I'm having a battle with my roommates right now. I moved into a new apartment, we do not have a lease, and they have always shoveled the snow. I told them legally, the landlord has to. They claim that only applies to the sidewalks, but our driveway, steps, basically everything else on the property is our responsibility. The MA gov websites seems pretty clear on the matter in my opinion, but they aren't agreeing. They don't want to push the landlord because they fear a rent increase. \n\nEDIT: I live in a single family house. \n","answer":" I was going to say it depends on your lease, but you don't have one. In that case I have no idea. At my old apartment the stairs down was the tenant's responsibility and the landlord took care of everything else. At the apartment before that I was responsible for everything except the parking spaces. At my current place I'm responsible for none of it.\n\nI'd say just shovel the driveway.

{"question":"Just wondering if not hiring someone based on their reason for being fired from their last job, when made public, could be reason to not hire that same person with any company that deals with the public.\n","answer":" Yes, \"we don't like your publicly available history\/PR\" is a perfectly valid reason not to hire someone."}
{"question":"Throw away for personal reasons- will try to make this short as well\n\nAfter class I was walking out with someone having a conversation. I saw a [fan that I thought had fallen over](http:\/\/imgur.com\/tmrieV5), it was a hot day so I assumed it was out for the kindness of the students\nWhile lifting it, I immediately fell into a manhole. \nEnded up skinning my legs and arms pretty bad\nI now get a blue screen error on my laptop whenever I open it to a certain degree or press on the screen to hard(touch screen functionality).\n\nWent to the doctors that night to check if I needed stitches. Did not fortunately.\n\nDon't care about the small copay from my doctor visit, but my laptop is another story. It still functions, but more like a desktop now. \n\nThe next day all manholes they were working inside had caution tape around them. \n\nIs this worth pursuing for damages on my laptop?  Should I hire someone to help me with this?\n\nI can answer any questions in a few hours. Thanks guys\n\n\n\n\n\n","answer":" So you already know from the other posts on here that you shouldn't have done what you did - not that it's that big of a deal, you were trying to be helpful. That being said, youre not 100% at fault. While the manhole was blocked and you removed the blockage, that is in no way a reasonable or safe way to secure a hazard. \n\nI wouldn't sue, but I'd contact the school *in person* and explain what happened and your damages, specifically your laptop. (Start with your Dean of Students office and ask who would be best to talk to about this.) Ask the school what theyre going to do better to block access to hazards on campus and to replace your laptop. Worst thing they can do is say no about your laptop.  Don't acknowledge your fault but don't assert blame either.  Any reasonable administrator or counsel for the school would see that paying you a couple thousand for a laptop is the easiest of fixes to potential future headaches from you. Plus, forgetting you personally, this is a safety issue that needs to be addressed. Answer #2: I don't see anyone you could sue over this.  There was an obvious hazard.  It was property that didn't belong to you, and you attempted to move it without permission from anyone.  This was 100% within your control.  And I honestly can't figure out how you managed to fall *into* a manhole while removing it's cover.  Answer #3: Thanks everyone for taking the time to comment. Sounds like I shouldn't have moved the fan! Oops!"}

{"question":"Hello first time here! I live in California. I had a job as a housekeeper but have recently quit. It was my first ever job and Had been there around 9 months. I handed in my letter of resignation the following day after I told my boss I quit. I quit Friday, handed to letter Saturday. To be honest he was actually the real reason I quit.

I wasn't a bad employee, in fact, I always finished my work on time and did extra (work that I should have probably got more pay on).\n\nAnyways, I asked my coworker to inquire my boss on when I would receive my final paycheck. He was told \"She'll get it when I'm finished with it.\"  \n\nHow long can he withhold my paycheck? Can he do this?

These cars are parked on driveways, not the public street.  Since when can a HOA start enforcing laws that the local counties are handling?  Is that legal?\n\nFYI my tags are not expired.

{"question":"here's my example: yesterday I was driving through an unfamiliar town and my phones GPS wasn't operating without a signal so I asked a couple of young boys (looked about 12 or so) for directions to my business appointment. They seemed willing and helpful and gave me the directions. HOWEVER when I followed them I ended up 10 miles out of the way in the opposite direction. I eventually did get to my appointment however my client was very upset about my tardiness and he refused to see me. It appears I lost out on this business opportunity.

I am considering going back to the town to hunt them down so I can find out who their parents are. Would I be able to sue them?\n","answer":" No, you can't successfully sue them.  And if you tried to, there's a very strong argument that you would be bringing a frivolous suit and you would be responsible for paying the other side's attorneys' fees.  No one is responsible for you knowing your directions in the absence of a GPS other than you.  Honestly, you should have known better than to rely on young children for directions.

{"question":"I rented a house and the lease says I am responsible for the mowing of the yard. I am not capable of doing it myself but wasn't worried about it because I figured I could just hire someone.\n\nSure enough I moved in and found a kid next door who was mowing a lawn, asked him if he wanted to make some extra money mowing mine, he said he'd do it for twenty bucks a week every Saturday. We've been happy ever since (since July).\n\nMy landlord was recently over to repair something while he was mowing and told me I am not allowed to pay someone else to do the mowing because it's a liability.  He said I either have to do it myself personally, or he will do it for $70 a week. He said $70 because he lives 45 minutes away so he has to account for his driving time and gas.  But obviously $70 is way more than $20 as you can see.\n\nIf the lease doesn't explicitly say I can't hire someone to do it instead of doing it myself, can he actually stop me? \n","answer":" I can't imagine the landlord has the power to say no.  You are leasing the property, you get to use the property as you want.  Just like the landlord can't tell you that you can't have guests over (if that's not in the lease) he can't tell you to not let someone mow your lawn.  It's different with things like plumbing and carpentry generally, but here the lease specifically gives you the power to mow the lawn.  And you can mow that lawn in any way you want, that is not forbidden by your lease.\n\nAdmittedly, it's possible that I'm wrong here, because I've literally never heard of anything like this before.  I have no idea on what grounds the landlord could refuse to let you do have the neighborhood kid mow the lawn, but don't use this advice as a hill to die on.  However, the fact that I've never even heard of anything like this leads me to believe you can tell your landlord to bugger off here.Answer #2: Interesting.  \n\nYour landlord thinks that if the kid hurts himself on the property, the landlord (or his homeowner's insurance) could have to pay the bills. He's probably right.\n\nI'd recommend hiring a commercial lawn service company. They have worker's comp insurance and business insurance, and if you give your landlord proof, he should be happy.\n\nYour rental insurance may cover the liability, you'd have to check with them. (You have rental insurance, correct????)   You'll have a harder time convincing your landlord, though. A commercial service would be an easier sell.\n\nGood luck."}

You first need to file a claim with their insurance and go that route because trying to sue a huge corporation like that isn't going to be cheap or easy. It isn't automatically their fault that you slipped and fell in their parking lot, you would need to prove that they were negligent in failing to keep their parking lot safe (ie did not plow or salt it at all) Just because it was icy doesn't mean they are at fault, as it is not reasonable to expect them to be able to rid the lot of 100% of all ice at every minute of the day."}

I have documented all the attempts to get the device back to the client.\n","answer":" I am not a lawyer, or Canadian, but since no one else has weighed in:\n\nIn most venues, a shopkeeper or service provider has a lien on property in their possession for the services and\/or storage they have placed on it.  This usually related to auto tow yards and mechanics (garage keepers as they are commonly called, and my dealings as an adjuster for insurance claims is how I am familiar with the possessory liens on impounded and repaired cars) but the principle applies to smaller chattel as well.\n\nCheck out here:  http:\/\/www.servicealberta.gov.ab.ca\/553.cfm#types  specifically under the section titled Possessory Liens Act.   This appears to clarify you do have a lien on their chattel (funny, I used that word earlier before I read it on this page).  So the short answer is yes, you would be able to eventually recoup the cost of your services based on the lien you places on the property.\n\nThe thing I don't know is what AB requires for you to properly notify (or attempt to notify) the owner of your intent to liquidate the asset as recovery against your lien, what time frame is required, and if\/how you may need to notify their apparent Personal Property Registry of this sale.   Hopefully someone else can weigh in, or that office can clarify if you contact them.   I hope this gets you started on the proper track, or someone else can give you more actionable advice."}

{"question":"A few months ago, I slipped in the shower and cracked our bathtub. The landlord brought in a 3rd party contractor to see if they could repair it, but the crack is too large.

You panic and reflexively shoot a nurse trying to perform a routine blood draw.Answer #2: If you shoot someone, you can almost always be prosecuted.  Whether it will go to trial, and whether you'll be found guilty, depends on whether a \"reasonable person\" would think that the needle represented a threat of death or serious harm.\n\nThe first \"reasonable person\" is the prosecutor, and the next is any member of the jury.

The fact that you are broke now doesn't mean that you will be broke in 6 months or 3 years.Answer #2: She is suing to get paid the money you owe her.  Not out of some odd vengeance. \n\nSuing helps ensure she gets paid. And extends her claim enforceability essential forever as long as she renews the judgment every seven years. And allows her to execute against your assets should you refuse to pay voluntarily. "}
{"question":"I'm working in a cafe in California with a tip jar. The tips are divided evenly among the employees based on hours worked for each shift. As it stands the supervisors share tips evenly with the rest of the staff and the owner takes all of the change from the tip jar home. Between the owner and the supervisor they are taking approximately $50\/day from the tip pool.     \n     \nI'm not sure how the law views tip jars. If it were pooled tips then the supervisors would never be allowed to participate, even if they were directly serving the tables; but I don't know if the law views the jar on the counter as a tip pool. The vast majority of the tips we receive come from credit cards, not from the jar.    \n      \nWhat is the legal recourse to take if I choose? What are the penalties for management that takes tips? How should I go about documenting anything? \n","answer":" The law views a tip jar as containing tips.  \n\nYou could make an unpaid wage complaint about your employer withholding tips you feel you are entitled to.  You would be entitled to your unpaid wages, plus possibly some additional penalties, if you prevail in that.\n\nIt could be hard for you to establish exactly how much the owner and supervisor are keeping.  They could be forced to turn over any documentation about it, though.  \n"}

{"question":"My mom is an insane stalker and she has a friend where I live in my hometown who is a Texas ranger. She always has threatened me she had a friend here who spied on me since I left home 7 years ago. \n\nI know she has had my friends plates ran before which is illegal enough but now apparently he has been patrolling by my house and running the plates every two he sees a new car here?

Another couple she has been stalking and harassing ( I know that's a whole other story) --knew the name of the Texas ranger and I know him.\n\nI'm pretty pissed and wanted to call immediately and talk to his supervisor or something but Im a little nervous of him retaliating? My mom's pretty psycho and I don't want to pick a fight with a crazy person but this pisses me off.\n","answer":" Sure, call their supervisor. I can find out a ton of information from any plate of any car I see on the road, so nothing illegal is going on here. Answer #2: Definitely proving not only that the ranger is the one driving by your home and running plates and feeding this info back to your mother seems high. If he is doing it, he is likely violating the ethics and policies of his job, however, I'm not sure it's necessarily illegal. \n\nYou'd be better off focusing on this real problem here - dear old mommy. Apply for that restraining order. Change your phone number and lock down or delete your social media. You may even want to consider moving, for your own peace of mind and sanity. \n\nGood luck OP. "}

{"question":"I used to have billpay set up to pay rent. We recently moved and no longer pay our old landlord, so we cancelled the automatic billpay. Noticed today that somehow another \"rent\" check went out and was cashed by our old landlord, who by the way, is not very responsive or responsible.\n\nI called Ally and they said that because of a new system switch, many auto billpays that have been cancelled have been accidentally reactivated, including ours. They refuse to credit our account and said the best they can do is to start a dispute and will try to get in touch with the payee. Meanwhile they suggested that the best way to resolve is for us to ask our old landlord for the money back.\n\nSo long story short, Ally admits their mistake, they took funds out of our account and sent it to a third party, and now they expect us to track it down.

That's pretty bad that they sent out a payment after you cancelled it.Answer #2: IANAL, but I am a bank regulator.\n\nAlly is primarily regulated by the FDIC.  I would suggest contacting the FDIC Consumer Response Center.  Additionally, you can look to file a complaint with the CFPB, they might not be able to help directly, but should be able to point you in the right direction.Answer #3: The bank should refund you and pursue the landlord on their own dime.

{"question":"I've been working at my current job for close to a year now so I decided to inquire about signing up for a 401(k). I've known that my employer's policy requires employment for 12 months, so that's why I've waited. But now I'm being told that only full-time employees who work 40 hours\/week are eligible to sign up. I work 8 am - 5 pm, 3 days per week. That is 24 hours\/week, around 1200 hours\/year.

{"question":"If I were attacked by another individual while swimming at the beach in FL, could I drown the individual in self defense? Would the stand your ground law be applicable here?\n\nThank you\n","answer":" Drowning is deadly force. It is extremely doubtful that drowning someone at the beach is going to qualify as legitimate self defense let alone be covered under any stand your ground laws. There are just ever so many better ways to stop someone from attacking you than by holding them underwater until they die and the police\/courts will recognize this.Answer #2: Deliberately drowning a person would be hard to justify as \"self-defense\".\n\nSomething like shoving a person away, they trip, hit their head, and accidentally drown could almost certainly be successfully argued to be self-defense.  But actively drowning a person ... well, it's not like on TV.  It's not \"head enters water, 10 seconds later they're dead\".  It's several minutes of fighting the person to keep their head under water enough so that they can't breathe (while they're holding their breath), then once they do inhale water to keep them there longer while they actually drown (up to a minute for an adult), and the whole time they're fighting you trying to, well, not die.\n\nIt's not *impossible* that this could be ruled self-defense, but taking five minutes (or more depending on how hard they fight you) to kill a person is much *harder* to defend than something like \"He was coming at me so I shot him\"."}
{"question":"I just had one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a cop. I was driving down a highway in Arkansas at a speed I won't specify. A cop passed me and pulled me over. Okay.

I then told him \"I'm unemployed, thanks\" as he's about to leave.

I have two tickets that say different speeds detected on radar. Can I contact the prosecutor or judge about this?\n","answer":" It's not double Jeopardy. You aren't being prosecuted twice.\n\nIt sounds like he was trying to cut you slack by issuing a citation for a lower speed than he clocked you at.\n\nIs the speed on the ticket (not the voided one) correct? If so, then you are out of luck.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is at the officer's discretion to write you a ticket, angering the officer by talking back is likely to encourage a more severe penalty."}

Answer #2: If I may ask, If you can legally conceal carry why do you sometimes open carry?Answer #3: They could attempt to terminate your lease.

{"question":"[NYC] I’m about to sign my first lease. The application said $2,000\/month. Now the lease says it’s $2,900\/month with a clause noting it’s $2,000\/month so long as you pay within the first 10 days of the month. So essentially a $900 late fee. I plan on paying rent on time so it shouldn’t pose an issue except that it seems weird to me. The apartment is not rent controlled and online it seems the landlord can charge any late fee they want, so this presentation seems weird. I wanted to know if I was missing something. Thanks!\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" That’s not a $900 late fee. It’s a $900 discount for paying on time. That difference is important. If you sign you’ve agreed to rent at $2,900 so it would be challenging to argue you shouldn’t pay that. \n\nJust because it’s a scheme doesn’t mean it’s illegal. If you don’t like those terms don’t agree to them. Answer #2: Nothing illegal about that, it's just a stiff penalty for you to ensure your rent is in on time. Answer #3: The landlord is trying to get around any potential late fee rules by giving a discount for timely rent. The only issue is the possible bait and switch with applicant and lease, I don’t know if that applicable though cause applications may not be binding nor have any reason why the rent needs to be listed. Answer #4: Check to see if the apartment is rent controlled\/stabilized. This almost sounds like a scheme by the landlord to report a higher rent than they're actually charging. Shady landlords do this because once they reach the magic threshold set by the Dept. of Buildings, they can take the apartment off the rent control list and charge market rates."}

Hence the nature of a gift -- you give it without expectation of giving it back. What counts here is whether this went to you and your wife, or your wife. You would be well-served by consulting with a divorce attorney to be sure. "}
{"question":"Tried to make an eye catching title for a kinda bland question. \n\nI know under most laws, including the US, it's illegal to hit someone with... well anything... especially a car. I was watching  r\/Roadcam where someone hit a bike thief and this was brought up. I was wondering... is there a difference between hitting someone with a car, and pulling completely out in front of them where they have no room to stop? If so, where does the line of someone hurting themselves vs being assaulted more or less lie. I understand there's a lot of maybe in law, but I good reference would be nice.\n","answer":" I think if someone did assault themselves they wouldn't face any criminal charges but you would be looking a compulsory stay at a psychiatric facility assuming you survived. Answer #2: If you pull your car out in front of someone and they hit you, then you can be said to have assaulted them even if they are in the striking vehicle.  The standard in my state for felony assault is something like \"knowingly cause or attempt to cause serious injury to the other person.\"\n\nThat could easily fit that set of circumstances.\n\n"}
{"question":"Reddit, I have made a terrible mistake. I started out a relationship two years ago with someone who has turned out to be a nightmare. I tried to help her while we were dating by signing a common law marriage form that was notarized and allowed her to get on my insurance. Since then, we have bought a car together and other large purchases. When I finally said I have had enough, she has contacted a lawyer (this would have been her 3rd marriage).....I know, I know, I know... Turns out that she has been saving texts from arguments and many other things. I have never been married, nor engaged and she is 12 years my senior. I do not know where to even begin, but if there is anyone out there that can help, please do! This common law marriage did not seem that it could hold water and I wanted to make sure I am not digging myself deeper by not taking action or any other actions I take. I am taking deep breaths but truly panicking.\n","answer":" Your common law marriage is valid. There's no time requirement in Alabama like other states. "}

{"question":"I am a supervisor at my work, in British Columbia, Canada. When I was promoted to this position I was told that we could not leave the site for our breaks, we had to always be available for duty. I was told by another supervisor that she had asked about getting payment for breaks, as is required by law, but was essentially told if she brought it up again she would lose her position.\n\nI've been a supervisor for 2 years now, and a change in upper management, as well as some new supervisors being hired, has brought this issue up again. They decided they would start to pay for our meal breaks.\n\nMy question is, can I get them to retroactively pay for our breaks? 2 years of unpaid half hour breaks, not to mention countless times that, had they paid for our meal breaks, would have put me into overtime, it's a significant sum. Apparently they told one of the other supervisors that they would not pay retroactively.\n","answer":" You can get help through the Ministry of Labour to find out if you were entitled to paid breaks all along, and to receive back pay if you were and if you cannot resolve this with management yourself: https:\/\/www.labour.gov.bc.ca\/esb\/\n\nKeep in mind, they will not investigate a complaint unless you can give them some evidence that self-help was tried: e.g. you and your coworkers wrote management a letter bringing up the fact that you should have been paid for your breaks.  a written statement from your co-worker who asked and was told her job was in danger might be sufficient here.\n\nSo step 1 is to call them and find out what your rights are.\n\nStep 2 is to notify the employer of your rights, or provide evidence this was already tried.\n\nStep 3 is to make a complaint."}

If a court finds that any provision of this Lease is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited.\"\n","answer":" It means pretty much what it says -- if the lease includes an unenforceable provision, only that provision is unenforceable.   The rest of the lease is still valid.\n\nExample:  The lease says you can't wear purple clothes in your house.  The landlord finds out you wear purple clothes and tries to have you evicted.

To that end, the law allows four primary means of service: personal service, meaning that the Summons and Complaint are personally handed to the person being sued; service upon some third person at the defendant's residence, if the third person is over age 14 and resides there; service at the defendant's place of employment, to a person who appears to be in charge or responsible for receiving papers; and, finally, service by mail, with two copies: one regular first-class mail, and one certified, with a return receipt.\" A lawyer can confirm.  However,  notification is another matter.  "}
{"question":"The petty cash would amount to only 100 dollars every few months. It would be deposited into my account and I would collect it in order to buy small office supplies.\n\nI asked if the petty cash could instead be deposited into the office expense account (which we have and regularly use) but was told that the responsibility was considered too small to be handled by management.\n","answer":" Could you have them put it on a prepaid card of some kind if you aren't comfortable with the bank deposit?Answer #2: No, I wouldn't agree to this. The company can easily spend $20 to buy a drawer safe like [this one](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Key-Lock-Security-Box-Safe\/dp\/B003R5086Q\/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=undefined&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kds-1), put in the $100 and top it off every few months, and give you the key. Then all you need to do is include the receipt and keep a spreadsheet of what you spent the money on.Answer #3: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n&lt;breath&gt;\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nNo.  They should give you a prepaid credit card, perhaps.  Keep your receipts.Answer #4: Absolutely not. For one thing, if you ever get audited the IRS will see cash inflow from your employer to you which looks like you're getting paid an extra $100\/month you aren't reporting as income, lets avoid that. \n\nYour company needs to keep company funds in its own account to avoid any problems. Answer #5: I would be very worried that they might turn around and blame you for missing money.  They could also claim no office supplies were bought, and try to take it back, or any number of potentially awful things.\n\nOffer them a compromise.  Create a petty cash checking account in the company's name, and give you access to that account.  That way it's very easy to see that it has only ever been spent on office supplies, and has never e.g. had cash withdrawals from an ATM, or been swiped at a liquor store.  That should satisfy their desire to have you deal with the money instead of them, and stave off any potential accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nIf they refuse that, I'd worry that they might be setting you up to be fired.  They might not be, but I'd still worry."}

{"question":"My grandfather purchased 2 plots about 25 years ago at a very large local cemetery. We recently decided to sell the plots. We went to the cemetery to verify the location and take pictures of the area and were told that one of the plots had been double sold by accident, and that someone was already buried in the out plot. The cemetery told us that they would just give us another plot to replace that one. \nI've never had any dealings with this type of thing and and currently researching how to handle it. I spoke to the State of Florida Funeral and Cemetery Services and they advised me to hear the cemetery out and see what they are willing to do. I plan on doing this but would also like to know before hand what options I may have for repercussion. \nWe paid $2000 for each plot, they double sold one of them. New plots in the same area are worth $4300 each. Ideally, I would like them to buy back both lots at $8600 and be done with it.  \n\nAny insight is appreciated. \n","answer":" As long as the plot they are offering is equal quality to the one you purchased, you won't really be able to take any legal action.\n\nThey are under no obligation to buy back your plots. If they did (NOT likely), it would be at the same price they were purchased for.Answer #2: The sale of a cemetery lot is not a real property transaction. Rather, it confers a right of burial.\n\nBecause of this, it's a breach of contract action. Your damages are $2000.00 (or maybe $4000.00, if the argument that the value of the lots is only as a pair flies).\n\nSo what you're negotiating for is a pair of replacement plots if you still want them, or $4000.00 and you surrender the remaining plot, or $2000.00 and you sell the remaining plot privately if the plots are currently going for more than $2000.00.Answer #3: &gt; New plots in the same area are worth $4300 each. Ideally, I would like them to buy back both lots at $8600 and be done with it.\n\n That's not going to happen."}

{"question":"New Mexico, USA \n\nMy girlfriend and I moved into a condo in July, and signed a lease which included our pets: a cat and a dog (a labrador retriever).

We have not spoken to the condo's owner or the HOA directly. The rental agents are saying we can vacate without lease-breaking fines or get rid of the dog.

We are unable to make this tight window with three small children and no help. We've even paid the dues and they still send the threats. What can we do?\n","answer":" It depends where you are, but the HOA covenants should have showed up in your title work when you bought the house. If they didn't, either you're not really in the HOA (don't owe dues) or your title insurance company has some explaining to do. Try and get an explanation from your title company\/closing officer - they should have some more insight before you spend any money with an attorney, but that is probably where this should go. \nAnd - also depending on where you are - the HOA can't \"DO\" much - they'll put a lien on your property, but typically they are not allowed to actually foreclose on that lien (evict you, etc.). But you'll have to ask someone familiar with the laws in your area. Answer #2: Depending on the situation this might be something title insurance can cover (at least for the past due fees). \n\nYou need to find out for sure whether or not you are governed by the HOA. Where you go for that info will depend on the location, but generally you can find restrictive covenants at the county recorders office.Answer #3: &gt; We've even paid the dues and they still send the threats. \n\nWhat do you mean?  You've paid the past-due bill(or whatever)?  What is the issue, then?Answer #4: This makes no sense - the people who sold you this house were legally required to disclose this information to you.

{"question":"Tommorrow I have a flight from Spain to Miami, and then I will grab another flight from Miami to Honduras. Today I got the notification to do the online check in. After writing all my info, the website told me I couldn't do the check in because my passport expires in less than 6 months. Is this an issue I can resolve by going to the airport, or is it more serious than that?\n","answer":" You will have to clear immigration in Miami, even for a short transit period. The US requires that your passport be valid for 6 months beyond “the initial period of contemplated stay” in the US. It looks like you are missing that 6 months by just a few days.\n\nHowever, the US has treaties with a number of countries so that passports from those countries are are exempt from the 6-month’s requirement. If you hold a passport from [one of the countries on this list](https:\/\/fam.state.gov\/fam\/09FAM\/09FAM040309.html#M403_9_3_B_2) you will not have a problem. Honduras, unfortunately, is not on the list.Answer #2: You are traveling on a Honduran passport? \n\n[Here's more on the six-month rule.](https:\/\/www.fastportpassport.com\/blog\/six-month-validity-passport-rule\/)\n\nThe computer system probably just flags any expiration date shy of six months in case you are going to a country that imposes this rule. It is a requirement of the Honduran government, but if you are a Honduran citizen with a Honduran passport you should be fine."}

{"question":"I was stopped at a checkpoint, possibly because I was not wearing a seat belt, and once the officer looked at me he decided I was under the influence. The exact exchange between the officer and myself is not clear in my mind. To make matters more interesting the officer was wearing a body camera. I am pretty sure I outright refused the field sobriety test and maybe the breathalyzer too as that test was never done. No blood work was done either. \n\nI am wondering if I should plea guilty since I'll likely look drunk on the camera or if I should plea not guilty since they did not take any blood alcohol test or if I will get the DUI regardless because I refused the tests.   \n\nAlso, I got charged for failure to obey police and obstruction but do not know what I said or did to get these charges and do not know how to approach them at all. \n\nEDIT: This happened in WV. It turns out to be a drugs DUI and not alcohol. \n","answer":" That you don't remember the incident does not work in your favor. Find a local DUI defense attorney and listen to them.Answer #2: If you don't know what you were doing, and can't even remember your interaction with the officer, it's very, very unlikely you would prevail at trial.  Your own testimony makes it obvious that you were impaired.\n\nIf you want to go this route, get an attorney. Answer #3: The observations of the officer during the interaction can be used as evidence to convict you of DWI.\n\nIf you were drunk enough that you don't remember what happened, then your chances of being found not guilty seem pretty slim to me.\n\nGet a lawyer and ideally you'll get a favorable plea bargain.Answer #4: You didn't post location. In many states, refusing the breathalyzer will get your license suspended automatically. Then you still have to deal with whatever they have against you for the DUI."}

{"question":"My wife was a child actress back in her teens.  Her family\/parents are abusive and manipulative and throughout the course of her growing up she was told it was against the law for her to see how much money she made.

It basically means any type of technology developed at the company becomes the IP of that company.Answer #2: I am not a lawyer but a software engineer who has seen these things before. Legally they do tend to be enforceable and I've seen people get in trouble by thinking these can't be enforced. That said, in my experience most companies have a less strict form of this that they will use if someone raises a stink. Your husband should refuse to sign this and ask for an amended version that limits it to inventions made on company time with company owned equipment.

We didnt even get arrested, and were told that it would NOT go down exactly how my insurance says it has. \n","answer":" There are two different parties here, the state and the insurance company.\n\nThe state charged you with an open container violation and trespassing. Assuming that you paid the fine for it, that's what it will remain, and it's now over with.\n\nMeanwhile your insurance company sees a report that you, underage, were driving with an open container. They are choosing to treat this like a DUI for the purposes of insurance risk calculations (which makes a lot of sense, if you think about it, since an open container in a car with an underage driver is one sip from turning into a dui).  You can appeal the ruling or find another insurance provider. In the meantime, pull a copy of your driving record from the state to make sure it is accurate."}

Send them a copy of the agreement she signed. Sorry about your dog, good luck.Answer #2: If it is worth going back to court for your puppeh, get a lawyer and file contempt of court.  She violated your agreement; it's pretty clear cut.Answer #3: So she doesn't reside where she works? But you can hire a private investigator to track her down."}
{"question":"So my girlfriend and I are in the process of looking for new employment, and she is worried that the university she attended will not confirm to potential employers she is a graduate. She successfully completed all coursework, but is still paying on what she owes the school. It isn't a federal loan, but funds actually owed directly to the school.

{"question":"If I was an air traffic controller, and I passed the initial pre employment drug screening and was hired.

And if I do, how likely would try employer be to persue action considering I’m a good worker?\n","answer":" Yes you can be fired for testing positive for marijuana if that is the policy of your workplace.Answer #2: Yes you can be fired. There are thousands of positions in recreational states that still will fire you for usage. Especially in your field. Stop smoking and keep the good job.Answer #3: In the U.S. I'm pretty sure air traffic controllers are all employed by the FAA (or at least the vast, vast, vast, majority).  They're federal employees.  There's all kinds of medical tests and [health conditions you can't have and medications you can't be on while working in that job](https:\/\/www.faa.gov\/other_visit\/aviation_industry\/designees_delegations\/designee_types\/ame\/amcs\/media\/3930.3B%20AME%20Summary%20Sheet.pdf).

It will be impossible to make ends meet with the loss of income.   \nCan I go ahead and ask for a reduction now or do I have to wait?   \nAlso, I can't afford a lawyer so I'm going to have to do this myself.\n","answer":" Contact the child support enforcement agency helpline for your state. You will need to go back to court and file a motion. I would start saving for a lawyer if she can’t be civil w you. \n\nAnd 40 miles is not that far; just don’t move.  Answer #2: I would speak to a family law attorney first. Courts do not always modify child support payments if a person gives up a source of income voluntarily. You have a good reason for it, perhaps, but don't move without running this by someone who is experienced in your local family courts."}
{"question":"I've had 4 Amazon packages delivered to the neighbors below me. The package is always opened when he returns it too. There were a couple of times where he came upstairs and hand delivered the package to me with my room mate standing behind me . I want to do something besides cursing him out when he walks his dog. Is there anything I can do legally without confrontation ? \n","answer":" \"Hey, stop doing that.\" \n\nOr contact the post office to make a complaint.\n\nWhy is he getting your packages? Can you leave a note telling them a better way to deliver your packages?Answer #2: I would be more irritated at the delivery service for constantly misdelivering the packages. \n\nHonestly, in this day and age, consider yourself lucky that he’s bringing them to you at all. If you get angry at the neighbor you may never get any mis delivered packages from them again. I know it sucks but take it up with usps, amazon curriers, ups or fed ex. Answer #3: Maybe he orders a lot on Amazon and is doing it by mistake? Ask him politely to double check the name and address before opening them. \n\nYou could also contact the PO and complain. Answer #4: Not legal advice but amazon advice. Go to customer chat and let them know your package was delivered to the wrong place. \n\nTheir logistic software is crap and we walked through which building and floor mine was in the apt complex so now they have a lot of notes on my account to improve. The person on chat and I were both on google maps and used all sorts of landmarks to make it as easy as possible for them to find. Answer #5: Realistically speaking I think you should consider whether or not it's malicious. When I get a package I don't check the name on it, I go \"Oh cool! A package!\" and rip it open. Is he just noticing that it's not the item he was expecting once it's open?"}

He intends to just keep the down payment and call it good. Is this legal? If so what should we keep in mind?

If you are making payments on the loan, whatever your dad does with the money is his business. So if he wants to give you the money to repair the car it's ok. If you default on the loan then then the car can be repossessed. "}
{"question":"I am tasked with finding legal representation for a friend who found himself in a big mess overnight. The friend is accused of a serious crime, with up to life in prison for the particular offense. I have found a lawyer (online), that has visited said friend multiple times. The criminal defense attorney is willing to take on my friend as a client, with a $20,000 retainer. His hourly is $600+, with $200+ hourlies for associates\/investigators\/etc. \n\n\nAre these reasonable numbers? Anything I should look out for? Where can I find a third party attorney to look over this matter before signing?\n\n\nAdditionally, what are common ways to finance retainer fees? Credit card? Loans? House mortgage?\n","answer":" If you're having to finance even the retainer fee, you can't afford this lawyer. Answer #2: He's going to run out of money.  Let's be blunt - the guy will be bankrupt as a consequence of this case.  That said, federal cases have staggeringly high conviction and plea rates, so his life is very likely over regardless of the financial hit. \n\n$600 is a lot, but if he's in a niche area of the law, it may not be unreasonable.  It is not uncommon for people to sell their homes, max their credit cards, beg from family, etc. to fund these levels of cases.

{"question":"I have a younger brother that still lives with my parents.

He’s been smoking weed since he was 14 years old (18 now).  \n\nHe’s always cost my parents their security deposits. Yesterday we all had the last straw, he went on a violent rampage that ended in him getting physical with me and my dad. He sells weed, and occasionally I see some pills around. \n\n\nAlso, he’s been arrested twice as a juvenile, but was not charged either time.

We live in an upper middle class suburb, but he managed to find friends involved with gun violence and who knows what else. \n","answer":" &gt; Is there a way to alert the police without implicating my parents or me?\n\nNo.  You can make your report, and offer your testimony that the drugs belong to your brother and not to you, but the cops don't have to believe you and you can't prevent being charged for it.  \n\nHaving said that, if your brother is running with a rough crowd, he may very well be under police attention already.

{"question":"I watched a video the other day where a person described being covered in gore after an act of violence. At the time, they were a minor.   \nEvidence was combed from their hair, collected off of their skin, and even their clothes were confiscated, in a thorough (from the persons point of view) process that took several hours.  \nWhen this minor's parents were finally informed and had arrived, the child (who had been through something horrific and traumatizing) was sharply chastised for trying to seek comfort- A hug from their mother.\n\nAt what point does the argument for preserving whatever evidence might have still been left override that child's autonomy or that mothers desire to intervene and say 'no, my child needs to be comforted right now'?  \nFrom a strictly-legal standpoint, not a moral one, were these police doing what they were supposed to do in preserving evidence, or was this demand something else?\n","answer":" &gt;From a strictly-legal standpoint, not a moral one, were these police doing what they were supposed to do in preserving evidence, or was this demand something else?\n\nIt depends on if they were actually done collecting evidence from the child. Every little bit of physical evidence tells a story. Blood splatter, trace, DNA, hair, dirt in the grooves of the shoe, spit in a bite, it's all important to collect it prior to the victim getting cross contaminated. \n\nBlood splatter, for example, can change if some of it transfers off. Defense is going to argue that it's not a reliable indicator indicator because blood got smeared. Or the parent is a suspect\/not a suspect, because a hair\/skin cells were found in the blood, giving the defence attorney reasonable doubt. \n\nJust basically any kind of potential contamination is a huge problem that could get the killer off the hook. \n\nAs far as it being legal, yes. The police can detain you long enough to get a warrent to collect what is obviously evidence of a violent felony, and collect it. Even if it's a minor and the parents don't consent. \n\nIt's tricker when it's sexual assault. Courts general won't force a sexual assault kit collection on a minor, just like a adult."}

You then will need to fill out an affidavit setting forth certain facts about the judgment debtor (last known address, etc) together with certain facts about the judgment (that it hasn't been paid and hasn't been appealed).  Here is a link to the website for Dade County (Miami) that gives better details:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.miami-dadeclerk.com\/courts_civil_foreign_judgment.asp\n\nNot a Florida lawyer (and definitely not your lawyer) but my understanding is that Florida's homestead exemption protects a person's residence from being sold to pay judgment debts.  So it is worthwhile to think about what other assets the debtor might have that you could get to.  Did you sue a company for your judgment? If so, and that company has nothing, you can't go after the owner's other companies without filing a lawsuit showing grounds to do so (hint: this is a high burden to carry and you would definitely need competent legal advice to do so, from an attorney licensed in Florida).  \n\nTL;DR: Don't throw good money after bad."}

Only if you're reported could you face actual charges.\n\nIf you are reported to the police and the police come to speak with you DO NOT speak with them without an attorney present. You have to tell them that specifically, that you will not speak to them without an attorney and then stop talking to them until the attorney comes. Don't answer any question without your attorney there, not even to confirm what the school reported you for.Answer #2: It [looks like](https:\/\/law.justia.com\/codes\/new-mexico\/2006\/nmrc\/jd_30-31-23-cab3.html) possession of a schedule IV controlled substance like Xanax is normally a misdomeanor and is “punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) or more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by imprisonment for a definite term less than one year, or both”. \n\nHowever, since it took place in a “Drug free school zone”, it’s a Class D felony, with an 18 month sentence. \n\nThis isn’t something you can try and keep from your parents.

They told us we could pay 10 percent of the bond but is it really worth paying it? she is also pregnant. Anybody has a idea of what could happen if found guilty? (most definitely she is)  does she have any hopes at all? should we bother getting a Attorney? all this looks and sounds so expensive and we not ready for it. Any direction would be greatly appreciated.  she is 19 years old.\n","answer":" I would not pay bond. Let her sit in jail - at least you know she'll be eating, have some pre-natal medical care, and (hopefully) won't have access to alcohol and drugs.\n\nIf you (family) can afford it, a criminal defense lawyer wouldn't be a bad idea. The other option is for her to get a public defender. (I'm assuming she has no money.)\n\n"}

{"question":"A sixteen yr old is accusing two over 21 relatives of molestation.  They both deny it.  They are devasted because they are both married and the father of the girl is threating to call the police if they do not leave town.

The girl is known to sleep around with different older boys cuts herself and keeps saying no one loves her among other things.  I want to help but do not know how.  This is happening in California.  \n","answer":" They should NOT talk about ANYTHING related, semi-related, or ~~unrelated~~ (oops went too far, but you get my point) to this situation to ANYONE without their lawyer present.  And especially not to the police.  Even (ESPECIALLY!) if they threaten arrest, promise to \"make it go away\", or some similar common tactic.Answer #2: &gt;The girl is known to sleep around with different older boys cuts herself and keeps saying no one loves her among other things.\n\nThese are all signs of abuse, FYI.Answer #3: If the police contact them at all they do not say a damn thing without their lawyer present.  \"Having a chat to clear things up\" really means \"Lets see how much I can get out of you to use against you in court\".\n\nAs for the girl, she may actually have been or is being molested by someone else and the accusations against the two are a way of acting out.  Her actions as you describe them scream 'cry for help', and it would seem to be a good idea to look into them.

{"question":"When I turned 18. My parents took me downtown to a city building and told me to sign some paperwork. I had no idea what I was doing. I didn't question it (yeah I'm stupid). Years later. We got into a huge argument and I was kicked out. My sister eventually told me that the house is actually in my name, and that bills are coming in my name. I have no paperwork of ownership. Can I legally just take the house? One bill was unpaid and went into collections. I didn't know about it either. Can I also sue for the amount?\n\nEdit: I live in California.\n","answer":" Go down to city hall, pull the property records, and find out if it's actually true. Then proceed from there. If you do own the property, then you're liable for the taxes and may be liable for the public utilities if the current occupants default on them. If you don't, don't sweat any of this.\n\nIf you discover that you do own the property, you should speak to a real estate lawyer before doing anything. It may be possible to unwind the transfer (though I'd personally guess that it's unlikely), or you may have some enforceable right to remain on the property, or you may even be the sole owner, in which case you may be able to evict your parents or sell the property and keep some or all of the proceeds.\n\nYou should also pull your credit report, and ensure they haven't opened other accounts in your name."}

I'm referring to off-site, paid, non-work related events that involve \"fun\", no work talk. \n\nI have always had panic disorder and agoraphobia, and I was very open about it when applying. Every time a work event comes up, my supervisor seems to be uncomfortable or upset. I'm really, really worried that my disability will get me fired.

Possession of less than one ounce is now treated as an infraction in California.  So you are not entitled to a public defender.\n\nIf its your first appearance, ask if there is a diversion program that could lead to dismissal, like drug court or some other program.  If not, decide what you want to do.  If you want your best chance at a dismissal or reduced charge, you need to find an attorney, so plead not guilty and go find the money for one.

I am almost 30 but I have only seen him four times :(\nTopic:\nCustody Divorce and Family\n","answer":" It sounds like he doesn't want to petition on your behalf. \n\nIf he submitted false information on his initial petition (like claiming not to have any children, when he knew he had them), that could be considered \" Concealment of Material Fact or Willful Misrepresentation\" to immigration officials, which is one of the few ways a naturalized citizen could [have their citizenship revoked](https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/uscode\/text\/8\/1451). That's fairly unlikely though. It sounds more like he's using that as an excuse not to even try. \n\nHowever, even if he did petition for you, adult children of US citizens are not \"Immediate Relatives\" given first priority of admission to get a green card. It would take several years to process your application (anywhere from 7-19 years, depending on which country you're from. If you're married, it would take even longer, but your spouse and kids could come too).  And there are additional requirement needed to prove he is actually your father, especially if your parents were never married.  "}

{"question":"I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I couldn't think of a better one. If there's a better sub for this question, please let me know and I'll move it over there.\n\nI am looking for a federal equivalent of California Welfare and Institutions Code 5150 which provides that police officers, health care providers and others have the capacity to involuntarily hold a patient for 72 hours (or 14 or 30 days, per WIC 5250 &amp; 5270) if they are deemed to be a danger to themselves (or to others). I know that individual states have specific versions of this main theme, but I was wondering if there was a federal equivalent that would allow me to use one citation instead of 50. I was considering [42 USC 1997](https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/crt\/civil-rights-institutionalized-persons), but it seems to be talking more about the rights of institutionalized people, rather than that people can be institutionalized for X, Y, Z. \n","answer":" This is a state matter, so you would, generally, need to cite the correct statute for that state.  \n\nI don't know that there is a federal statute.

{"question":"This sucks.  I hate addiction and breakups.  I got a DUI in 2010 in CA then one last month in AZ and then last night I flipped my truck on The busy 101.  I don't want to go to prison.  All my family lives back in the southeast.  Should I just pick up and leave?  Would I still be able to have a Valid Tennessee license?  I'm 28 feels like I just ruined my life and as I sit her sobbing part of me wishes I didn't put my seat belt on last night.\n","answer":" No, you should find an AA meeting, then a lawyer.Answer #2: What state? By your use of \"101\" I'm going to assume CA - in which case according to [this website](https:\/\/www.avvo.com\/legal-guides\/ugc\/what-makes-a-dui-a-felony-in-california) your third DUI isn't a felony. However your fourth will be. \n\nIf you think your family would provide support - once you finish your criminal matters you can and should seek that out.  Three DUI's is more than a warning - you are bottoming out. \n\nDon't sit there sobbing.  I guarantee you that there is an AA meeting starting in the next few hours somewhere near you.  Get there. It may not be the right program for you long term, but it might help now. \n\nGood luck - worse people than you have beaten alcohol addiction so you can too.  Answer #3: You are incredibly lucky to be in CA, most states would autofelony a third DUI. \n\n\n\n\nOnce you inevitably get an interlock device and finish the amount of time they prescribe (which will require staying in Cali for monthly inspections) and probation (likely also requires staying in Cali) move to a place with solid transit and never ever own a car again.

{"question":"Is it reasonable to expect that internet should have same laws as real world?\n\nThis is sometimes expressed. But I've been perceiving that the internet communication simply does not follow the same psychology as real world. Thus I find that the idea of internet being governed by same laws does not fully hold.\n\nIt may hold in cases such as causing a libel by e.g. publishing photo manipulations. But when it comes to e.g. \"troll content\", then this is where I find that the internet culture simply deviates from how people behave in the real world.\n","answer":" The internet is part of the real world. Defamation laws apply to the internet.Answer #2: You seem to be overlooking the fact that the internet is not a physical location. People are held to the laws in the jurisdiction where they stand or act. You can't create an internetland system of jurisprudence, simply because nobody in fact lives in the internet.  \n\nAnything beyond that is a question for philosophers, not so much attorneys."}

I received a letter from the RMV telling me that my default date was June 29th and I no longer had the option to contest it and they racked on $85 late fee. This means my letter sat for 6 days before being processed. Plus it was post marked for the 22nd. I should have sent it registered, I know. The DA cannot help me. What can I do?\n","answer":" Yeah you would have something to go off of had you sent this certified. It will be very hard to pursue this given that you don't have verifiable proof on your end.

{"question":"I'm currently working a job where they had us \"sign\" a document which said we would be working 4 ten hour days without overtime. Is this a legal thing to do?

I'm not too concerned with my own pay or anything, because I'm working for fun, but I feel like my coworkers are getting screwed over by this, and they get paid little enough as it is.\n","answer":" Your employer can set up a standard work schedule of four 10 hour days instead of five 8 hour days. That doesn't mean you've signed away overtime; you still have to be paid overtime if you work more than 10 hours in a day or more than 40 hours in a week.\n\n&gt;Not only that, I work at least 10 hour days, once a week. My last paycheck(Bimonthly) says I worked only 16 hours, which is complete and utter bullshit.\n\nIf they refuse to pay you for all the hours you work, you can file a wage complaint with the labor commissioner.Answer #2: Entering into an alternative arrangement like 4\/40 or 9\/80 or is legal in CA.  Employees have to agree to it.  A lot of employees love such arrangements -- they get extra days off.\n\nIf your paycheck is wrong and your company refuses to correct it, you can contact [DLSE](http:\/\/www.dir.ca.gov\/dlse\/howtofilewageclaim.htm) and file a complaint.

{"question":"Yesterday I left my ex fiancé. Not going into why. This morning I went into my bank account to change the password (I was changing everything). My checking account was cleared and my saving held just enough to keep it open. I called the bank to put a hold on my account but the employee said that it was too late to get the money back. I have a personal checking and savings and a joint checking with the ex. In my transactions I could see my money was moved from my personal to the joint and from there to the ex's personal savings. Is this considered fraud and identity left or petty theft because I honestly didn't have much in there.\n\n\nI live in the USA.\n","answer":" Is not fraud, its larceny.  And a possible violation of the computer crimes act 1986.   \n\nIf you were the only one on your personal account and he was not a designated signer.  Then he stole the money. Even if you had given him the password in the past(but not a signature card) he still stole the money. He accessed your account with out authorization and transferred the money with malicious intent. \n\nYou need to file a police report and then rephrase to the bank what he did.  Do not use the standard teller they are pretty much useless in this matter,  call and get bank security and fraud department on the phone.  \n\nAlso get an attorney to have his accounts seized(maybe) and go after him civilly until this is resolved or he is arrested. If you wish to pursue this you may get more back than just what he took.\n\n Answer #2: To clarify...\n\nThe money was moved from a checking\/savings (that was just in your name)- and moved to a joint checking\/savings account (in both names).  It was then moved to an account under just their name.\n\n\nIf this is correct (and the original account was solely in your name) then that was identity theft.

Are there consequences for me if I don’t appear?  My neighbor also received a letter to appear as a witness, as he was outside and took me in. Does he HAVE TO appear?  What are the likely consequences for her?  No prior record and she has a public defender. Thank you all. \n","answer":" You are a victim of DV and making excuses for your abuser, like victims do. Plenty of people have severe mental from childhood trauma and don’t break anyone’s arm or throw a glass object at anyone’s face. \n\nI suggest you get some services from an agency which helps victims of domestic violence and put this violent criminal in your rear view mirror. Maybe experiencing some criminal consequences will be her impetus to get some mental health treatment . Or maybe not.  Fuck her. Answer #2: Have you been subpoenaed or just asked? The difference is important, if you have just been asked then you can tell the DA you respectfully decline, at which point you will likely be issued a subpoena which you must comply with. If you have been subpoenaed you must show up and truthfully testify. You can always call the DA and tell them your wishes. They may or may not listen to you."}

{"question":"So today in class we had a vocabulary word which was \"aperture\". My teacher then took his dslr (digital camera) and took a picture of every student to \"show us how an aperture worked\". He also asked a student who he knows does not like him very much if she \"wanted to post for the camera\". Is there anything I can do against him legally since it is very disturbing that he has a picture of me and most of my classmates on his personal camera. During the year he has also made several different alarming gestures towards several of my classmates saying, \"If you dint understand that come after school for some private tutoring\" after a joke he made. Thanks for any help you can give me.\n","answer":" The laws change depending on the state you live in. Generally, ***publishing*** photos taken in a public school for monetary gain other than journalism, would require a signed model release from each person that is identifiable in the photo. \n\nIf the photos your teacher took are not going to be published, then your school district likely has restrictions in place requiring parental consent for photographing a minor on school grounds. Your legal guardian(s) probably signed a media release at the beginning of the school year, deciding if photos taken of you can be used by the school. \n\nSo, before asking \"Is there anything I can do against him legally,\" talk to your administrators and find out the photo and image guidelines that they have implemented. I would also explain this situation to them. The actions your teacher took are creepy and unprofessional. \n\nLegal action may not be the best solution to your problem in this case......"}

I let them know it was a tip and was not stealing but I'm still afraid they will think that I was taking money and file charges. Do I have anything to worry about legally?\n","answer":" No. Tips being the casino's money and not yours is a policy, not a law. Answer #2: What's your job at the casino and where it is located? Can no one there accept tips or just people in certain jobs?\n\nI've worked as a lawyer for casinos I've never heard of this, except rules prohibiting managers from accepting tips. Putting it in with the house money, then putting it in your pocket, then putting it back with the house money, was not very smooth and you shouldn't do that again."}
{"question":"I live in an apartment complex in Raleigh, NC where the units are maintained by the property manager. Just moved in back at the start of August. I noticed an issue with the bathroom toilet a few weeks in where when you flush, the water will continue to run long after and eventually stop after a while. Didnt think much of it for a while until I was finally fed up with the noise it made and reported it to maintenance. Lo and behold, I get a $300 water\/sewer bill for use of 32,000 gallons in 28 days.\n\nI've already paid the bill as I didn't want to be delinquent, and I reported the condition to the property manager to make sure something else wasn't wrong. Maintenance team found nothing else, so it had to have been to extending flushing issue I had the first few weeks.\n\nMy question is: do I have any hope of getting the property manager to help with this water bill cost, as the maintenance issue wasn't really my fault? Or am I just boned?\n","answer":" Unlikely, as you noticed a problem and failed to report it in a timely manner. Answer #2: That's a hundred and twenty thousand litres, for everyone else.\n\nUsing a no-calculator value of 13 litres per flush, I make that OVER NINE THOUSAND flushes in a short month. That's not an \"extended flushing issue\" so much as \"a toilet pissing nearly four tons of water a day down the line\". I'd love to live in a place where that'd only cost me $300.\n\nI'd think that kind of defect in a fixture is definitely the sort of thing management should be compensating you for.\n\nAnswer #3: You can call the utility company and they can reduce the bill in cases like this. Ask for a leak adjustment. Get a receipt from the plumber when they come to show that a problem was fixed. That is pretty cheap for that amount of water though.

This may be state specific, but I know where I've lived before it's totally illegal to offer a rent-to-own on a house that you don't own outright (to prevent exactly this scenario). \n\nCould criminal charges be brought against the landlord if this rent-to-own was illegal to begin with? Would a criminal charge of some kind be helpful to a tenant pursuing damages in this situation? This is very sad to me- rent-to-owns are cool in theory, but are so often used as a way to take advantage of people who cannot secure a traditional mortgage and have dreams of home ownership. So sorry for your friend. Answer #2: The tenant's remedy is to sue the landlord on the contract."}

My cousin was born in America and has Canadian citizenship, her wife is Japanese with Canadian citizenship. As far as I know, neither of them has renounced any of their citizenships.

{"question":"I can survive without it since I'm still working, but it would really give me some breathing room.\n\nI haven't filed taxes in six years. I know that's a problem. In February I met with an accountant to finally start sorting things out, but that was a little late now that the virus has hit. I shouldn't owe anything, which I assume is why the feds haven't been hassling me to file.\n\nThe only information I can find is resources on how to get the stimulus check if you're not required to file.

{"question":"Hey guys,\nI'll try to make this as brief as I can.\n\nI have been ordered to appear in court in New York on 12\/1 as a result of a paternity suit. \n\nHere'e the fun part. I don't know the woman. I have never been to New York. I was not sexually active at the time of conception for the first child (there are apparently two whom I have fathered.) Long-story short; definitely not my kid(s).\n\nI have a rather common name, so I'm thinking maybe it's a big misunderstanding? Anyway, do I need to hire an attorney for this?

Not sure if that changes anything. \n\nThanks guys!\n","answer":" Definitely do not ignore it, and definitely hire an attorney. Do not simply try to explain that it's not your kid without taking the appropriate legal action (as determined by your attorney). There are documented cases of men in your situation who either ignored such claims or simply tried to explain that they were not the father, and then ended up on the hook for child support.Answer #2: Do you want to pay child support? If not you should hire an attorney. "}
{"question":"They're clearly over the weight limit by a large margin and the leasing office is definitely aware of the animals. We want to move anyway, is this enough to break the lease? \n","answer":" I don't think another lessor violating a pet weight limit would be enough grounds for you to break your lease, that doesn't really affect you, especially if the landlord okay'd it.\n\nThe barking could be an issue, but if they just moved in, you'll need to make complaints to the landlord, and have a paper trail. You can't just say the dogs were barking one night and expect to be let out of your lease.\n\nStart documenting the dog barking, make complaints, and try to figure out with your roommates if they can stop it. If you really want to move, you should just pony up and pay the termination fee, because it seems like your grasping at straws to get out of your lease agreement without penalty.Answer #2: To specify, it's not technically student housing, it's a private apartment complex. We have a tiny dog that we really aren't comfortable having around these dogs. When I asked about terminating our lease yesterday they told us that we would have to sublease our rooms, and they would prioritise renting out every other room in the  complex before renting ours if we left. It's a separate lease for each bedroom so we have 0 control over who moves in, they literally gave us 2 hours notice before he moved in (their policies say they give multiple days notice, workers in the office wanted their commission and he needed to move in that day though.) I can't imagine each room in this 4br is allocated 2 pets either. Our leases each have around $3,000 left on them (359 a month), would it even be feasible for them to sue over that amount, when they definitely won't be vacant for the remaining 8 months anyway? "}

The show will be filming in California.\nTopic:\nContracts\n","answer":" This is highly specialized stuff.  I doubt most entertainment lawyers have dealt with these, because most reality show contestants don't have lawyers review the contract before signing.\n\nThat's really what you'll need to do if you want the contract reviewed -- have an entertainment lawyer do it.

I left a note for him to contact me with my number.  \n\nWhat can I do to get him out of my house?\n","answer":" &gt; What can I do to get him out of my house?\n\nGive him proper notice terminating his tenancy (30 days), then go to court and file for an eviction if he's not gone by the end of that period.Answer #2: You need to evict your tenant in compliance with applicable state and local laws. It looks like 30 days notice is necessary in your location, and on the 31st day you can go to court and file an eviction. You cannot change locks or remove his things in the mean time.Answer #3: Since nobody else has mentioned: It is very common in this kind of situation to offer a cash for keys deal where you pay them to move out. Usually the payment is 1 or 2 months rent. This is the fastest and least painful solution for you and might even be the cheapest considering your other option might be hotels."}

{"question":"So, a few months ago I got a letter from Comcast saying I was illegally downloading Dallas Buyer's Club (I was) and that if I wanted to contact an attorney about it that I should. I did, and the attorney told me write them and deal with it (not for free, clearly). Got a letter today, and Comcast is allowing me (HA!) to settle for 3.9k in damages. WTF!?
