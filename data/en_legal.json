{"question":"I gave my friend 180 litecoin to invest ($10,000 right now) because he had a “hedge fund”. He claimed to have a series 7 and that he could triple my money. Now I want my money back and he said he sent it to the wrong address, and he won’t show me any proof that it sent. I don’t know who to go to or what to do. Do I go to the police or FBI? Is it worth it to sue? Was a crime even committed?\n","answer":" Yea sue Answer #2: Scam is always a crime. Do you have any kind of evidence? A proof that you gave him this money? A written evidence that he would make you earn money with your investment?"}
{"question":"Boyfriend received a \"general discharge\" after 4 years from the army for what they deemed as a \"pre-existing condition\" (crohns disease). He had never been diagnosed or evaluated for crohns disease before the army. He now receives no benefits because of his discharge and they are requiring he pay back half of his student loans ($40,000), which he only has because they requested he get a degree to become an officer. Is there any way he can fight any of this? Mainly the student loans.\n","answer":" Former Naval officer here. \n\nThe general discharge seems right. If he did not know he had crohns, he does not meet the criteria for fraudulent enlistment. Nor is he qualified for an honorable due to medical conditions as the disease is not due to military service. Honestly, you are lucky they are willing to pay half the student loans instead of sticking them all on you. Nothing can be done if something was improper, other than appeal it through the VA. I'm guessing the reason the loans came into effect because he was the Army equivalent of STA21, and didn't finish the contract. "}
{"question":"I literally just got off a plane and went to pick up some drunk friends with my rental car. I parked on the side in a red zone with my blinkers on and got out the car to get my friends to help them in bc they were drunk.

I explain the situation and he still writes me up a traffic ticket for blocking the road, which I wasn't even doing. \n\nThe penalty is a whopping $160... which is completely stupid. I don't have time to fight it since I leave in a few days. What would happen if I just leave this alone? I live in PA \n","answer":" Having your blinkers on does not allow you to park where you aren't allowed. "}
{"question":"They gave me schizophrenia medication and seizure medication and salt water IV which is all strictly against my diet and lifestyle. I gave no consent. I was having a bad acid trip but i wasn’t aggressive but they forced medicine on me that negatively impacted me greatly\n","answer":" I love that you think a salt water IV is against your diet, but LSD is not. \n\nThe answer to your question is no.Answer #2: You want to sue medical professionals for taking steps to keep you alive when you incapacitated yourself with drugs?Answer #3: When you are unconscious, your consent is implied.  In case it's your next question... Yes, you are also responsible for the medical treatment bill.Answer #4: Medical Malpractice, which is what you are claiming, is very fact specific and you need to speak with a MedMal lawyer.\n\nThat being said, based on your post and your incapacitation, it does not sound like the clinic did anything objectively or reasonably wrong."}
{"question":"I met a girl on a dating app, app said shes 18 but she mentioned she's 17, I'm 22. Every google search says age of consent is 16, she turns 18 soon, I just can't help but feel like I'm going to get arrested. Am I 100% in my legal rights to meet up with her, and see what happens? I don't want my life ruined, but she's hot, and who the fuck made it that she can't be a day under 18 for it to be moral?\n","answer":" The law's not necessarily about what's moral. It's about what you will or won't be penalized for doing. Since there has to be a line somewhere (there's plenty of evidence that sexual relationships with kids are sufficiently bad for their development to be worth banning), the line's going to be a bit arbitrary.\n\nMany states do have a \"close in age\" exception to age of consent laws, to make the line _less_ arbitrary and to deal with the reality that teenagers will have sex with each other and probably shouldn't go to jail for it. New Jersey has such an exception, provided you're within four years of your partner: it doesn't apply to you, since you're more than four years older.\n\nThe age of consent in New Jersey is 16. If she's not lying to you the way she lied to the site, she can legally consent to sexual contact with you. However, your paramour is a minor: if her parents tell you to stay away from her, stay away from her.Answer #2: Life advice...don't do it.  There is probably a world of maturity difference between you two.  You are in completely different places in your life.  "}
{"question":"I was talking to a friend about the the Brock Turner case and how the judge recently got...I don't know what to call it...recalled? Well, my position was that even even though the judge made some very questionable comments to say the least, his hands were kinda tied. Because he was sentenced to 6 months which, as I understand it, by definition means it's a misdemeanor right? So the prosecutor pursued this as a misdemeanor and not a felony. Could the judge have said no that's too light? Or we're his hands tied?\n","answer":" The prosecutor decides which charges to bring agsinst the accused and the judge decides on if the accused is guilty and on the sentence.\n\nIf someone is charged and tried for murder, the judge cannot change the charge to manslaughter for example."}
{"question":"PA - Long legal battle. Every attempt at me ultimately just takes away from my kids and our time together. Not sure what to do besides remove myself from the equation then they can’t be used as pawns anymore. Or hear me crying. Ncp isn’t actually what’s best for them but maybe if I’m not there that will change. Assuming ncp will just file for emergency custody after a few days if I remain missing and after six months they’ll move to terminate my parental rights. Are there any other legal consequences of doing it this way? Child abandonment charges or warrants for not following the order?\n","answer":" You should speak with a therapist and a lawyer who can help you find the remedies here that don’t involve giving up time with your children. \n\nBut to answer your question more directly, the non-custodial parent could seek substantive changes in the orders, especially around child support payments. But probably could not terminate parental rights. "}
{"question":"This isn't about anything *specific*, I'm just curious how this works. Can you agree to a search, but a partial search? Like say the cops want to search your house (without a warrant) can you say yes to every room except *this* room? Or something similar? Or same with your car. You can look everywhere but don't tear up my seats? Don't look in the glove?\n\nI'll likely never have to deal with this because I would never allow a search without a warrant, I'm just curious how that works. It seems like since it's voluntary you should be able to have stipulations. \n","answer":" You can do this and you can revoke your consent at anytime. There is a danger to this, which is why it is always better to decline a voluntary search. If a cop is searching your car voluntarily and he is about to open the glove box at which point you start screaming \"I revoke my consent!\" you might have just given him probable cause by your reaction."}
{"question":"Milwaukee, Wi. I’ve been parking in a parking garage for 2 years downtown. I’ve been reversing into parking spaces the entire 2 years. Recently I had an “official” note placed on my windshield stating that I’m not allowed to back into the spaces. The contract on the back of the parking voucher in part reads “only a license is granted hereby and no bailment is created”. I’m not sure what that means or if it’s relevant but nothing else in the contract applies to this situation. Multiple vehicles reverse into parking spaces in the garage everyday and I’ve never seen another note left on a vehicle. I’m assuming the garage can do whatever they want. \n","answer":" Are the spaces straight or diagonal?   If the lanes are one way and you are backing into a diagonal space, you would end up pulling out against traffic.\n\nDid you have to register for access to the garage or is it one where you receive a ticket upon entrance?   It could be that they want to see your license plate and backing in requires them to get out of their vehicle and actually walk around to see it.\n\nAt the end of the day though, yeah, the garage can probably make and enforce any rules they want within reason.Answer #2: I wish my garage would institute a no back-in. I’m sure you’re perfectly good at maneuverability, but I constantly get held up in the morning by people backing in. Also, when I’m backing out to leave and you’re pulling forward to leave, I don’t have a clear visual cue that you’re moving. It drives me nuts. \n"}

Him and his girlfriend were drunk or asleep when it happened. They both live there with him. The cops found his still and some other jars of his homemade alcohol on the property. In South Carolina under the law what is likely to happen to my friend?\n","answer":" Lets be honest, it takes quite some alcohol to end up in the hospital, and kids that age are not prone to drinking that amount of nasty burning. Not saying it isnt possible, just saying the level of belief is low and cps will be suspicious. Get a lawyer ASAP."}
{"question":"So my friend is the dad, they have two kids, 7 and 4, and have been living together for about that long. I have looked into what constitutes common law marriage in Texas, and they meet the requirements other than getting it recognized by a court. And i read that they still have time to get it recognized (so they can get an official divorce) and what not.\n\nI'm worried that if for some reason they aren't able to get their common law marriage recognized, or that if the cheating 'wife' doesn't cooperate with him, would the dad be able to get much from the break up. \n\nI apologize if this is all over the place, but basically, the mom has been a terrible mom over the past year. Lately she's been gone at night, caught in lies, yelling at her kids that she's not coming back, and other things that would make a divorce case go in the dad's favor. \n\nBut what if he can't get to that point because she doesn't cooperate or even because of financial reasons between the two?\n","answer":" If he wants custody, he can file for custody. No divorce needed unless assets need to be divied up."}
{"question":"The guy hit my parents vehicle and ran off. The police found him and he admitted to doing it, his boss came and said the insurance company would basically pay whatever we wanted. The guy who hit my parents didn’t have a license either. I just don’t know where to go from here. My daughter isn’t hurt, but I want to sue for emotional damage as she doesn’t even want to go near her grandparents now. I also want to sue whoever gave him a car to drive, knowing he didn’t have a license. Do I have a case here?\n","answer":" &gt;My daughter isn’t hurt, but I want to sue for emotional damage as she doesn’t even want to go near her grandparents now.\n\nYou might as well not even entertain that road of thought. You aren't going to get very far basing a personal injury suit on emotional damages.Answer #2: Their insurance will pay for damages.\n\nThat includes damages to your vehicle and medical bills. Suing for emotional trauma isn't really a thing unless you legit go seek therapy due to said accident, then those bills may be covered.Answer #3: You aren’t going to get money just because, there needs to be something diagnosably wrong and actual money spent as a consequence.\n\nGo get your daughter examined by the pediatrician if she hasn’t been already. If they find something wrong, follow up with specialists. If therapy is necessary (it probably isn’t, but it’s possible), go do that. Replace the car seat. Those are the things you can get compensated for.Answer #4: NAL- same thing happened when my 3 y\/o kids were in the car with my mom and got rear ended. One kid went to urgent care right away. No major injuries other than some soft tissue bruising. Other kid did not go to doc at all. The one with the injury got $1500, the one without got $500 and they reimbursed the car seats immediately. So, she will likely get something but not much. Negotiate with their initial offer.  Also, make sure you immediately replace the car seat. They will reimburse you for that no questions asked. She should never sit in the seat again that was in the car during the crash."}

{"question":"So my mom found nudes on my phone of my girlfriend. She turned us in. That’s already about to be handled, I’m meeting with a probation officer to discuss if this goes to court or not. But my mom hates her and her family and is mad that her parents let us date knowing my parents didn’t. We’re both girls I’m 17 and she’s 15. My mom thought she was too young to date. And my dad is just homophonic. But after this whole case with the nudes is through, my parents want a restraining order on her and her family so they can’t contact me or see me etc. Can they actually do this if my girlfriend never harmed me, mentally or physically? My mom just hates her family and doesn’t want us having contact ever again.\n","answer":" Until you're 18 your parents can restrict you from contacting her even without a court order.Answer #2: It is very likely that a court will order you not to see each other given that you have exchanged the images. Your parents can just ask the court to make it part of any order and even if the judge was not planning on it. This is simply the reality of the situation in which you find yourself. Once you are 18, you will probably be able to see each other again, unless the court order goes on longer. Given you are both underage, you just don’t have much say. That is the way the legal system works for minors. Especially minors who have exchanged such images."}

{"question":"Hello r\/legaladvice I'm a recent college grad working an unpaid internship at a recording studio where they make us clean  and sweep and paint constantly. I think it's illegal. We are supposed to have one learning day a week and one cleaning day a week, but often the learning days are ignored. \n\nIs it legal for them to make us clean all day? I twisted my ankle painting ceilings for this place. It feels wrong. Any advice would help.\n\nLocation: Massachusetts \n","answer":" Massachusetts has stricter standards for unpaid internships than the federal ones. Under federal law, unpaid internships can be offered by for profit companies as long as they meet 6 standards that ensure the benefits of the internship go to the intern and not the company. However, in Mass. only a charity, or educational or religious institute can offer an unpaid internship. So right off the bat if this recording studio is not one of those you need to be paid min wage.Answer #2: That wouldn't be legal even if you got one learning day and one cleaning day.

My step son (who is 8) is already having emotional issues because she didn't even show for her weekend last time and was also left alone by his cousin for half an hour and now has abandonment issues at home with husband and I. \n","answer":" You cannot just ignore the custody order regardless of child support. If she has a warrant and you know where she will be at drop off you could tip off the police, they may or may not care to arrest her. Answer #2: You can't ignore the custody order. Of course, you can tip the police off. The may even do something about it. Your strategy will depend on how you handoff the child to her, and the exact wording of your order.\n\nYou can petition the court for a change in custody. Not paying child support doesn't directly impact custody, but being incarcerated for failing to pay it might. Get a lawyer.\n\nBesides the legal advice, your husband needs to get his son into therapy. Abandonment can leave lifelong impact on a child's mental health.Answer #3: follow custody order and do what your lawyer says is best advice, but if it really is having an impact on the child its reasonable to not put him through that. but you need support because your husband will be in contempt. parental alienation is a real thing but if school psychologist or gal can back it up (ie grades slipping\/etc) you could maybe get supervised visitation where visitation is structured and observed and reports made to court "}

My idea for an excellent way to give back (and to get my practice's name out there in a positive light) to have my whole (future) team of hygienists, assistants, and office managers (and myself of course) colunteer at our local disaster relief logistics company one night a week (with team shirts for PR!)\n\nSo my question is, can I offer employees a signing bonus with the stipulation being they have to volunteer with us if they accept it?  (One night a week, 2-3 hours)  Or is that basically forcing them to volunteer, which I'm guessing would be pretty illegal?  \n\n\n","answer":" One night a week? Are you insane? One night a month is pushing it. Nobody wants to give up 1\/7th of their evenings for work stuff. *Maybe* one Saturday or Sunday afternoon a quarter. It's great you want to volunteer, but for most people their job is just their job.Answer #2: Passion for community service is great. \n\nAnyone with a pulse can work at the \"disaster relief logistics\" place. However you will be a licensed dentist with a dental facility, so an evening per week there would be a waste. \n\nDental care is tremendously underserved in the US. \n\nFind an organization local to your practice that helps those in need. Offer to provide dental care to their clients. Restrict the offer to some number of hours or maybe 2-3 patients per week. \n\nThis would be much more valuable than anything else your office could do. And it is directly helping someone rather than filling boxes. \n\nAnswer #3: If you are insisting that employees do certain work as a condition of employment, you are going to need to pay them at least minimum wage for those hours, obey overtime laws, etc."}
{"question":"I live with 5 other people in a house in LA and we've been renting month-to-month for the past year.  At the end of the month, 4 of the current roommates will be moving out to be replaced by 4 new tenants. Today the landlord contacted us and said he will be raising the monthly rent from $4200 to $5200 per month.\n\nIs he allowed to do this?  Is it considered a new lease since new tenants are moving in? \nTopic:\nReal Estate law\n","answer":" In CA, landlords must give 60 days notice of a rent increase of more than 10% (30 days if less than 10%)."}

{"question":"Last year I paid $6100 for foundation work on my house. In my contract it said I have a lifetime transferable warranty. To transfer the waranty, its $100 but otherwise no other cost.\n\nI currently need warranty service but now they say I need to $75 per visit because of a new policy. I think this should only apply to customers who sign new contracts where this is in the contract. Am I right??\n\n","answer":" If you have the warranty in writing and it says that there is no charge for a visit, then you're right.  If it says something different you may not be right.  What do you have and what does it say?"}
{"question":"I am writing this on behalf of my roommate.  \n\n\nWhen my ex-boyfriend was my boyfriend I bought him a truck in my name under the condition that he make the payments and pay the insurance. He has gone MIA no payments in months, has multiple tickets, and has the police looking for him. I am told that if he gets in an accident or kills someone I am liable, I am also told that since it is insured in his name I cannot report it stolen. Do I have any recourse?\n","answer":" If he gets into an accident you defintely can be held liable *unless* you report it as stolen. Since you own it you can report it stolen. Who's insuring it is irrelevant there. Actually if he's insuring it by himself he's committing insurance fraud (you cant legally insure something you don't own) which is a felony."}
{"question":"What will happen? I've been so scared of it for so long that I've never even looked into it. I have essentially a confession from my father in email form.

I'm in Ontario, Canada.\n","answer":" How old are you? If you're still in school, go to the counselor - they're mandated reporters, will be familiar with the process, and can get you help dealing with it.Answer #2: Regardless of age call kids help phone, they'll take care of everything from there or at least give you advice on how to go about it "}
{"question":"I am conducting a real estate transaction, and the buyer's agent has sent me a signed agreement. The only caveat is that each page of the agreement is an individual PDF file. Am I able to combine the files and consider the agreement binding? Do I need to request the buyer's agent to combine the files into one?\n\nEdit: this is in Georgia\n","answer":" I would request the buyer's agent combine the files. That way you can't be accused of changing the content of the document (even if you didn't)."}
{"question":"I moved late into on campus accommodation. I've lived their for 2 years in the past, and they used to take a payment automatically from my account\/notify me if I didn't have enough to pay. But this year since I moved late I think I may have been a glitch in the system. I've been living here since March and haven't paid a penny over my deposit but haven't been reminded to pay through any form of communication. I'm moving out in June, when my tenancy expires will I still be legally accountable? Thanks!\n","answer":" IANAL and know nothing about UK law.\n\nYou should be prepared that they might figure this out at any time and demand immediate payment. In the US you would still owe this money and I'd be very surprised if that was not also true in the UK. You would be wise to set aside the rent each month in an account you do not touch. In the US they would be able to pursue payment of your debt for several years after the fact."}

Would this shirt be appropriate for a female to wear to court?\n\nhttp:\/\/www.kohls.com\/product\/prd-1151180\/dickies-performance-twill-work-shirt-womens.jsp\n","answer":" I personally recommend a business professional look.\n\nWhen I've been in court and on the stand it was button down professional shirt and dress pants and shoes.\n\nThat shirt is too casual in my opinion. It is a dickies work shirt.\n\n\nAppearance matters a lot."}
{"question":"I signed the lease, paid the deposit, and was notified by email (welcome letter) that the apartment was mine and all the paperwork was accepted. Fast forward a month and I get a call informing me that the current resident has decided to stay and the apartment was no longer available. They offered me alternative apartments with a cash incentive. I declined, stating I wanted to proceed with the current contract I signed. The complex said this was not an option.  I would like the apartment I signed the lease for, the other apartments they offered are not as desirable. My current lease runs out at the end of the year and it would be difficult to find a comparable apartment to the one I wanted in that time frame. They have offered to refund my deposit and application fee. What are my options?\n","answer":" You can sue them for breach if you can show damages but do you have any?  It sounds like they are acting reasonably and they likey signed the lease in good faith. You can either accept the alternative unit or get all your money back. Answer #2: OP- It's likely your rental contract with the landlord has a clause for just this situation (where the existing tenant reverses the notice they gave) that dissolves the lease (takes the liability off your landlord).\n\nYou should take back the deposit back and\/or ask for a bigger concession on the other unit(s) they're offering you."}
{"question":"I made a joke on my Instagram bio saying “I’m a school shooter running from the fbi” and a girl at school reported it to the principal I haven’t been questioned yet but still if he does what should I do? Will I go to jail I’m 12 so I obviously wasn’t being serious. Is this free speech or a threat.\n","answer":" I think this would be a good lesson for you to learn what is, and is not, actually funny. You're not going to go to jail but I would expect some questioning.Answer #2: You're being accused of being a school shooter...\n\n**because you said you were**.\n\n\"I was totally just kidding\" is not a great defense.Answer #3: “I’m 12 so I obviously wasn’t being serious” that’s not really how crimes work. Also, I’m glad that girl reported you, she knows what’s up. \n\nYou’ll probably do an evaluation and the school will likely give you a hard time. Hope you’ve learned from this."}

{"question":"Some background info, my wife has Grave's Disease. It is a hyperthyroid condition that shows up around 18. Her specialist did radioactive iodine treatments and killed about 90% of it. This caused her to have to take sinthroid to replace the missing thyroid hormone. (I'm no doctor, this is just what I was told.) She is now 38 and has been on sinthroid for years. Her current doctor has been managing her sinthroid levels for years. The normal range is 6-12. If it's below 6, then he raises her meds. When we actually looked up the labs for the past 4 years, we noticed that her thyroid level was 78! The only reason we thought to check was because a new nurse practitioner called us in a panic to tell her to stop the medicine. I'm thinking that I should talk to a lawyer, and I probably will regardless. I just wanted to post here to see if that's the best recourse. Thanks!\n","answer":" Are we talking T4 values here?  If so, I would be downright shocked if your endo didn't notice that the lab values were 5x higher than they should be for years.  Here's what probably happened.  The labs usually report T4 values using a 5-12 range in ug\/dl.  However, because people like to be difficult, some labs report their values using ng\/ml.  Why is this important?  Because a 78 ng\/ml reading is actually a \"normal\" 7.8 in ug\/dl.\n\nSo go personally get a copy of the blood test results and see what reference range units they use.  \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a doctor or any other kind of medical professional.Answer #2: Talk to a lawyer. An issue like this is way to complicated for anyone to be able to give you any meaningful advice without both specialist knowledge and a full appreciation of your individual circumstances.\n\nMost medical malpractice lawyers will give you an initial consultation for free to decide if you have a case worth pursuing."}
{"question":"I wanted to do a cosplay of a character from the game “We Happy Few” and I wanted to create my own edible “Joy pills”. So I wanted to know if I would be breaking any laws but doing so. Now I don’t plan on filling them with drugs, it’ll most likely be sugar, so they have some weight to them. Yet in the end I really just wanted to know if I could do that.\n","answer":" If they contain zero pharmaceuticals and you make no attempt to sell or pass them off as legitimate medicine, you should be fine from a legal standpoint.  Personally, it'd be a good idea to make them oversized or something so its even more obvious that they aren't real.\n\nI would however contact the venue (I presume the cosplay is for a con?) and just check with them beforehand that it's ok to bring them, because I wouldn't put it past security to confiscate something like that.Answer #2: You could just use vitamins if you're lazy."}
{"question":"I'm in Ontario, Canada. The fire alarm for my building (6 floors, ~8 units per floor) is inaudible from inside my apartment as it is on the far end of the hallway. I contacted the building manager, they said they aren't gonna do anything. I contacted my city's fire department safety inspector and he keeps blowing me off and not returning calls. My provincial fire code specifically says \"alarm signalling devices shall be located so that the alarm signal and alert signal when sounded, may be heard throughout the building over all normal sounds at any time.\" What are the legal options I have to push forward with this? I want to have some weight to throw around to convince the fire department to remedy the situation, I don't care about getting money in a lawsuit or getting people in trouble I really just want to be able to hear the damn fire alarm. Any help would be much appreciated.\n","answer":" Talk to the city councillor for your ward, then. The fire department ultimately reports to council, and your councillor may pick this up as a bit of easy constituent outreach.\n\n\"I called my fire marshal with a fire safety concern at my apartment, and they never even returned my calls\" might do it."}
{"question":"My friend's doctor perscribed her the medicines Lexapro and Trazodone. Even a simple google search would reveal that the two drugs are known to interact badly. Unfortunately, her parents did not check this and my friend ended up in the hospital for serotonin syndrome, which is exactly what Lexapro and Trazodone can result in. Can the doctor face any legal repercussions? Is there any way to sue the doctor for the money for the hospital bills?  \n\n\n(This is in Arizona)\nTopic:\nMedicine and Malpractice\n","answer":" Actually I thinking you are overstating the interaction issue. Yes they can, but it’s rare. And you need to understand that each of these drugs have the potential for fairly severe side effects if prescribed on their own (as do most drugs to be honest).\n\nBut med mal is very fact based and a specialist area. Most med mal attorneys will offer a free consult, so that’s what you should probably do. Be aware, I suspect that this is not going to go anywhere - the reason you have found anecdotal stories about this interaction is a function of the fact that in some circumstances this is a good mix for patients. In other words, it’s acceptable prescribing practices. So by all means consult an attorney but don’t get your hopes up.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who ended up with mild serotonin syndrome just taking one antidepressant and I know how miserable and ill I was. So  I do feel for your friend. I just don’t think this rises to the level of malpractice."}
{"question":"So, I live in the US. Georgia.\nMe and a friend were joking around, and I showed him a picture with a caption saying, \"Take your friend's phone, change your name to 'Brandy from the club', and call him at 3 in the morning and then hang up.\". I jokingly told him to do that to one of our friends, and he said it'd get him killed. Then the question rose in my head, wouldn't that be involuntary manslaughter? \n\nEdit: I meant, wouldn't he be associated and it technically be involuntary manslaughter on his end for doing so.\n\nI just want to get my head around this, since we've been in a back and forth regarding it.\n","answer":" This is a general answer. It's going to vary in minutia from state to state. It's generally when you accidentally kill someone through gross negligence, but you didn't mean to kill them. For example, you're drunk and start shooting homemade fireworks at your neighbor's garage as a prank. The garage catches on fire and your neighbor dies in the fire. Or your friend asks you to inject them with heroin because they're too afraid to do it themselves. You oblige, but accidentally shoot the up with too much and they die.\n\nIn your situation, your friend would not have any culpability. The person who did the killing would be charged with murder. Answer #2: It's when you oops and it results in someone's death. "}
{"question":"Was issued a warrant in Alabama for not finishing paying off a driving with a suspended license ticket. The thing is I live 3,000 miles away in Washington State and every one I called from the city said the only way to get it resolved is to come in and see the judge. Well I explained my situation and asked if I could do it over the phone, seeing as how it would cost 700 or more to even get to Alabama in the first place. She said no. I also asked if there was an email I could send to the judge explaining the situation, she then started to get mad. So I asked for the judges name and the address to reach him at for the city to send a letter and she at that point, angrily, gave me a name and an address of what she said was the judge but was actually the county attorney that only gives legal advice to county and city officials. I don't know what to do now and any help would be very much appreciated.\n","answer":" &gt;  I don't know what to do now\n\nYou should hire you an attorney to help you navigate this.

{"question":"Location: Texas \nMy grandmother has recently been put in the hospital due to poor physical health. Prior to her being put in the hospital, my brother and I took care of her. My brother lived almost full time with her catering to all of her needs. He balanced her check book, paid her bills, took her to doctors appointments etc. You name it, he did it. Since she has been in the hospital, power of attorney has been given to my uncle. He has been siphoning money out of her account at his leisure and my brother called him on it, so my uncle told the assisted care place she is currently at that he wasn’t allowed to see her. Is he within his rights to do so? I visited my grandmother today and she said that she wanted to see my brother, but felt powerless to my uncle because he has POA. My uncle can have the money. I genuinely don’t care. I just want my brother to be able to see my grandmother. \n","answer":" Your grand mother needs to meet with a lawyer ASAP and cancel the POA.  As long as she is of sound mind she can do so.\n\nSomeone with a POA gets to control decisions on behalf of someone who is unable to make decisions.

{"question":"Looking for advice for Colorado Divorce cases... I have googled to no avail. \n\nHere is the shortened situation. Husband and Wife have been separated for almost 6 years and now would like to file and get a formal divorce. During their marriage, they had two children who are now school aged. For the last 4 years wife has had no contact with the children per her own choice, the door has always been opened on husbands side. \n\nNow that they would like a divorce she would like to file without including the children. She doesn't want to get hit with child support, and she would like the current parenting plan to stay as is. Obviously, this is not ideal for the Father as he would not have finalized custody papers, however, for the sake of this discussion, let's focus on just the filing without the kids. \n\nI was under the assumption that you had to include the children in the divorce process, but I am unsure if that is really the law. Any thoughts?\n","answer":" A petition for divorce must indicate all living children from the marriage. That doesn't necessarily mean the mother will pay child support."}

I kill that person. Can I be tried again for their murder ?\n","answer":" Yes, you can be tried again.  \n\n\nKilling Seymour Butz on June 11th in Central Park is a different crime than killing Seymour Butz on August 15th in the Grand Canyon. The double jeopardy clause protects against successive trials for the same crime, not for two different crimes.  \n\n\nAnd a moment's thought would make this clear.  \n\n\nSuppose the crime was robbery. If you steal Seymour Butz's wallet on June 11th in Central Park, do you imagine that you're immune from a robbery charge when you steal his wallet  on August 15th in the Grand Canyon?Answer #2: Nothing would prevent you from being charged for killing the person after your release.  An erroneous conviction and sentence do not negate responsibility for actual crimes subsequently committed even in the event of it being the same basic criminal act you were previously convicted for in error."}

{"question":"I'm a 20 year old college student and I'm in a weird situation.  There's a company I used to work for and things weren't working out.

The document was about 18 pages long.  Where I worked for them was in ME but their office is in MA.\n","answer":" There is no magic to labeling something an \"agreement\" rather than a \"contract.\"  If it meets the requirements for a contract, it is one.  The fact that it is 18 pages long tells me it was probably drafted by someone who knows what they are doing.

{"question":"Location: NY\n\nIn school a few days ago, a kid picked up my backpack, asked if anything valuable was in it, and when I told him my laptop was in it he dropped it on the ground. When I got home I discovered the laptop was smashed. I went to the school who won't do anything because nobody saw it and the maggot is denying he did it. I am so disgusted right now. NINE people were asked about it and they all said they didn't see anything. One kid told the school that he heard a thump and saw the bag in front of the maggot withcme yelling at him. The school won't do anything with that information. If I file a small claims lawsuit, is there even a chance of winning? Is it up to the judge?\n","answer":" How old are you?  Depending on your age you may not be able to file anything legal by yourself.\n\nWith no credible witnesses and what seems like a \"he said he said\" situation, you will have a difficult time proving your case.  You can certainly try though.\n\nEdit- also, why did you not check your laptop there on scene?  Finding the damage after you get home is going to be another hurdle to prove that the damage was caused by the dropping of the bag.Answer #2: [You've already posted this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/3sprvu\/kid_at_my_school_purposely_broke_my_laptop_what\/) and the advice remains the same. You didn't take the time to inspect the laptop after he dropped the bag for 2 whole hours, without any witnesses or camera footage backing up your claim, there's nothing here but a really expensive life lesson. It sucks and I imagine your parents are breathing down your neck over a $1,300 laptop but in the future you'll  have the presence of mind to inspect for damages sooner rather than later.Answer #3: yes, it would be up to the judge. do you have any kind of insurance? they might cover this. you can also give them the kid's name. you should also file a police report."}

{"question":"I'm in a real pickle here. I recently moved into a garage unit, I have a lot of stuff (tables and furniture, as well as workshop equipment. I really enjoy living in my workshop and would like it to continue that way. My landlord recently found out it's \"illegal\" to live in the garage unit. She has this decided to move me into another room, one which my items will NEVER fit in, as well as I can not get work done. I have a six month lease signed with her. Naturally I am looking for a new place but chances are I won't be able to find one in time. I get that she might get subjected to fines, but I paid to live here and this is extremely stressful and time wasting for me. Obviously this breaks our rental agreement.\n\nIs there any way I can stay in the garage? What is the legal definition of habitation? Like for example, can I be in the garage most of the time but not sleep there? Can I just say \"tough titties\" to the landlord and force them to give me a 30-day at the worst?\n","answer":" It's your landlord's fault\/issue that she rented you a space she shouldn't have. My suggestion would be to negotiate with the landlord and allow you to rent a bedroom *and* keep the garage as your workshop until the end of the lease.Answer #2: &gt; Is there any way I can stay in the garage? \n\nIf it's not zoned for residential use or up to code (it's almost assuredly not), then no.  She's in breach of lease and you can negotiate an exit or an alternate arrangement, but you can't force her to let you live somewhere illegally.  \n\n&gt; Can I just say \"tough titties\" to the landlord and force them to give me a 30-day at the worst?\n\nIt wouldn't be a 30 day, it would be an eviction.

{"question":"Hello,\nBecause of a lot of financial mistakes many years ago I have both old tax debt and defaulted student loans. I am current on my tax filings but still owe taxes from 2006. But My bigger concern is the DEFAULTED student loans. They have been going from collection company to collection company.\nIs it possible to file bankruptcy out of this mess and get a fresh start? It is nearly impossible for me to pay back the student loans in the amounts they want. The student loans are from 1984-1990. I'm in Minnesota and I'm turning 49 this year.\n","answer":" Student loans are almost rarely dischargeable in bk and it has to be a chapter 7. You can meet with a bankruptcy attorney to see if it's right for you.  The general advice would be \"don't count on it\" when it comes to your defaulted loans.  One of the big reasons it's relatively easy to get student loans and the interest rates are low is because they are almost never dischargeable. Answer #2: &gt; Discharge in Bankruptcy\n\n&gt; This is not an automatic process—you must prove to the bankruptcy court that repaying your student loan would cause undue hardship.\n\n&gt; If you file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may have your loan discharged in bankruptcy only if the bankruptcy court finds that repayment would impose undue hardship on you and your dependents. This must be decided in an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court. Your creditors may be present to challenge the request. The court uses this three-part test to determine hardship:\n\n&gt; * If you are forced to repay the loan, you would not be able to maintain a minimal standard of living.\n\n&gt; * There is evidence that this hardship will continue for a significant portion of the loan repayment period.\n\n&gt; * You made good-faith efforts to repay the loan before filing bankruptcy (usually this means you have been in repayment for a minimum of five years).\n\n&gt; **Your loan will not be discharged if you are unable to satisfy any one of the three requirements.**\n\n&gt; If your loan is discharged, you will not have to repay any portion of your loan, and all collection activity will stop. You also will regain eligibility for federal student aid if you had previously lost it."}

{"question":"According to society’s views on responsibility whilst drunk anyone who has sex with you after you’ve had beer is a rapist and we would all agree that if a 16 year old forced an adult to have sex it would be rape, so by that logic if a minor has sex with a drunk adult it would be rape, but having sex with a minor is also rape and obviously raping a sober person while your drunk is still considered rape, so that would make the adult also a rapist.

{"question":" \n\nI  just wondered what i'm legally allowed to do if I'm out walking in the  park and a person randomly kicks my dog or another dog comes out of no  where and starts attacking my dog?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n","answer":" As another commenter has said, pets will be considered personal property. \n\nA person has a right to protect their personal property so long as it is reasonable.  \n\nSo it will depend on the situation.  \n\nFor example, if you’re walking your dog and then another dog comes and attacks your dog and you kick that dog in the face... this would be reasonable if it was a large dog.  However, let’s say the attacking dog was a chihuahua, kicking that dog in the face might not be reasonable, because you could have pulled your dog away or possibly shove the chihuahua with your foot. \n\nSo it’ll depend on what most people would do in the situation.  Answer #2: I'm not too sure but since dogs are considered their owners' property, you would treat it like you would treat the protection of your house?? I'm not sure, just spectating Answer #3: One clarification to make here is that you have the right to defend your dog DURING or to prevent the attack once attempts to attack have been made. NOT AFTER. So if someone comes up and kicks your dog, unless there's an indication they're about to have another go at another kick, you cannot use self-defense if that threat is no longer there. Answer #4: Oddly, I was contemplating a similar scenario recently.\n\nSuppose I am publicly walking my, let's say a pitbull, past a home. The owner of that home comes out with a gun, telling about how these killer dogs shouldn't be in this neighborhood and he appears as though he is about to shoot my dog. I am also armed.

Also, there is no way for us to know if the store should have done more.  Maybe the slippery condition existed for 30 seconds and someone had not yet noticed it.  Nobody here knows.  That is one of the things that a lawyer would help figure out.  It also may not matter, depending on the state's tort laws.  Talk to a lawyer.\n\n"}
{"question":"I recently had a friend who bought an iPhone 8 they ran a imei check on it. Everything came back clean and good. A few weeks later they get a notification saying that their SIM card no longer worked. Look at the imei again and it has a assurion claim on it. Is this a common practice and are there any laws to help prevent this?

{"question":"This employee was just reinstated after a 6 month investigation and home work assignment for telling multiple people he was going to shoot and kill a co-worker at work. A separation order was put in place between the 2 employees, however the perpetrator has a history of work place violence and pulling a gun in a road rage incident. I don't feel safe. What do I do?\n","answer":" Why haven’t you called the police. This is what they are for.Answer #2: You can quit.

If that does not change their mind, those of you willing to do so can threaten to quit, and then follow through."}
{"question":"So the house next door to my dad’s house is for rent, once again. The landlord made it section 8, in a neighborhood that is far from section 8. Mostly everyone in the neighborhood is very quiet and old. They all keep to their selves. The landlord keeps moving in people who have large parties, let their kids run around in the road, and the last 3 tenants have had the cops there CONSTANTLY. The landlord is not apart of an HOA. I plan to talk to him and ask him if he will do a background check on the next people he moves in, but another neighbor told me he is very rude and unresponsive to this. Is there anything I can do? Or should I just suck it up and shut the fuck up?\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" Unless they're breaking noise ordinances or doing anything illegal, there's nothing you can do.  \n\n\"neighborhood is far from section 8\" is a pretty fucked way to describe things, too.

{"question":"Can a individual legally move into a abandoned home\/ ghost town which we have many in Michigan rebuild and or repopulate? Legally?\n","answer":" You can move into the area as a squatter, then as long as you treat it as your own for 10(?) years it can become legally yours. Answer #2: Or you could look up who the owner of the house you want is, and offer to buy it for some incredibly low sum.Answer #3: The other side of this as well is that you can pick up some of those properties for next to nothing at tax sales and not have to deal with the risk of squatting.  Some of them the city may be willing to give away if the property or area is blighted enough because they will get the property taxes."}
{"question":"I have epilepsy. I was hospitalized in the ER after a seizure. After the seizure I had what's called a post-ictal state, which means there are temporary changes to my behavior which I don't remember.  Basically the hospital said they are pressing charges against me because I spit at a nurse in the patient room. The police officer said that \"they have it on tape and, if they see it on tape, you have to go to a judge.\"\n\nIs it legal for a hospital to be filming inside a patient room?

{"question":"Recently, a roofing company came to my street to work-on\/replace the roofs of some of the houses on my street. I did not  hire them for any services, but I let them use my driveway to leave some of their equipment. In addition, many tiles the roofs feel down onto my driveway. Before they left, they did clean up, but did a poor job. When I went to check, I found a nail left in front of my doorstep, and saw many tiles left in my trees. Is there anything I can do?\n","answer":" If you only found one nail after that many roofing jobs, they did a fairly decent job of cleaning up. You could sue them for the clean up, but honestly how much is it going to cost for you to pick up what they didn't?Answer #2: Clean it up. "}

{"question":"I recently moved into a public subsidized housing complex where they allow animals but they discriminate against any Pit-bulls and Rottweilers. My question is seeing I've gotten a new Rottweiler just now thirteen weeks of age, would it be acceptable to pursue acceptance of this animal within the complex as an emotional support animal. There is very little housing I can afford on my student income and being restricted to this single complex that is discriminating against my animal companion makes it extremely difficult on me. Any further suggestions, or thoughts on the subject would be of great assistance.Location Minnesota.\n\nThank You Very Much.\n","answer":" &gt; My question is seeing I've gotten a new Rottweiler just now thirteen weeks of age, would it be acceptable to pursue acceptance of this animal within the complex as an emotional support animal. \n\nEmotional support animals are not a tactic to be used solely to get your pet into a complex.\n\nIf you have an actual diagnosed disorder, and a psychiatrist who agrees that you **require** this animal, maybe.  If you don't have that diagnosis, and a treatment plan, and an order from your treating doctor, then you wouldn't qualify.\n\n"}

The unit is rent stabilized and the rate I have is frankly 30-40% under-market rate.\n\nI love the place and want to live there for many years to come. I am, however, taking a fellowship for the next year out of country and thus want to sublet the apt for the next year. \n\nI will be leaving the apt fully furnished. Am I legally allowed to sublet the apt for more than I am paying, keeping in mind the unit is fully furnished? I can't imagine the landlord can step in and say that I am overvaluing the furniture.\n\nThanks in advance for any and all advice.\n","answer":" &gt; the rate I have is frankly 30-40% under-market rate\n\nThat's the entire point of RSO.\n\nLos Angeles doesn't screw around. If you proceed with this plan you may or may not be sued, but you are likely to lose your tenancy in the unit for violating RSO for one or two reasons. One, using the rental unit for an illegal purpose. Two, failure to renew a similar rental agreement. You would not be able to get the subtenant out, legally, without going to court and testifying that you were illegally subletting the apartment. Way too much of a risk. If allowed, sublet it at the price you pay. Profiting off of something meant to make housing affordable is going to make the city attorney salivate, and with you out of the country, you'd be returning homeless and to a real legal mess."}

{"question":"My wife works for the state of Kansas, and also has eczema. Today she was put on paid leave through Monday and told not to come back until she had a doctor's note clearing her for work again. While she had been told it was due to concerns about communicability, the letter she received from her departments chief counsel was non specific in that regard. Overall it has been a fairly unwelcoming work environment, and we are taking steps to find her a job somewhere else, however she has felt she had a target on her back for months now. She has contacted her dermatologist and the note should not be a problem, but is this something we should be more concerned about?\n","answer":" I mean it's only prudent to make sure that a skin flaking illness is not communicable.

{"question":"I was recently charged $25 by a local business for a service when the written cost on the invoice was $125. I didn't notice until I got home, and frankly, they were quite rude and unpleasant so I was just going to let it sit and do nothing about it. They only had my name, cell number, and credit card number; no other identifying info.\n\nA week later they left me a voicemail and text message saying they realized they mischarged and to go back to get it fix. My question: am I under any legal (not moral) obligation to get this fixed? What is the worst that could happen if I just ignore it? They have no way of knowing that I even gave them a real phone number.\n\nThanks for any advice\n","answer":" You have an obligation to pay the amount agreed to. A mistake in accounts receivable doesn't void or modify the agreement.

The officer took both our licenses, spent quite a while in his car with them, and then told us to leave without saying anything about a ticket or anything or any charges. Does that mean he let us off with a warning, or should we expect to get something in the mail?\n","answer":" Depending on your location, the police will probably have years to decide whether or not to charge\/ticket you. \n\nRealistically, they probably just took your name, checked your background and made a note in case it happened again.

She really has nowhere to go but swears that she'd make sure I wouldn't get custody. I work a stable oilfield schedule, working two weeks on\/off. She says there is no way I'd be awarded split custody, regardless of my schedule. I'm a good father, she has no reason or basis for keeping me from her.

Thanks in advance.\n","answer":" Has she been evaluated for post-partum depression? \n\nThere is a very very good chance you would be awarded joint legal custody; what the physical custody would look like, given your job schedule and the baby's age, is hard to say, but certainly you have a good case for at least some visitation."}
{"question":"The other day I was looking at some of the leaked celebrity nudes and I was brought to a website which seemed to have pictures of every major female celebrity. However, I didn't recognize one of the people and as it turned out, they were relatively young (19). I have high anxiety and OCD so I began searching her age at the time of the picture (19 when it was leaked) and searched pornhub to see if it was there because I know they strictly monitor the site (it was). I am also a little nervous that the site was illegal. It boasted 12,000 pictures and the banner was all adults, but I am nervous that this site was illegal and monitored by the FBI. I think I made this worse by searching if the site was legal or linked by major search engines. The domain name had the word \"banned\" in it but I am not sure if this is just to make it seem scandalous and to refer to the leaked nature of the pics. Basically I am just really paranoid that the FBI will kick in my door. Did I do anything illegal?\n","answer":" I think you may want to check your CO2 monitor.\n\nBut actually, no. The FBI is not kicking down doors of people watching porn. And the site is not actually banned."}
{"question":"I'm curious, what happens to you when you're in the witness protection program? Are you still allowed to use your phone and log into social media? Are you allowed to be seen online, like on Instagram or Facebook? Are you still allowed to talk to immediate family, or do they have to go into witness protection with you? Also, will they kick you out of the program if you text close friends while in witness protection?\n","answer":" People in witness protection are there voluntarily, and are not restricted from resuming their lives. They're not under arrest, their rights have not been restricted by the courts, and they're not under any kind of guardianship.\n\nHowever, if you don't cooperate with the requirements of the program, then the program cannot protect you. The point is to make you hard to find, and making contact with old friends, posting to social media, and otherwise standing up and saying \"here I am\" runs counter to that. If you persist, you can be kicked out of the program, as you're clearly not interested in being protected."}

{"question":"I'm renting a condo unit under what I believe to be a standard contract. I've taken both pay and hours cuts at work and I've been struggling to keep up with bills. My last three rent payments have been paid in full 1 to 10 days late. \n\nToday I received this email. http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/wg8q57Qh.jpg\n\nI was under the impression that I could not be penalized for rent payments less than 14 days late, and that after the 14 days the landlord must go through the courts \/ landlord-tenant board for an eviction. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I respond to this?\n","answer":" That's not legal notice of termination, since it's not in one of the forms required by law. If your landlord wants to evict you for non-payment or for persistent late payment, they need to give you one of [these forms](http:\/\/www.sjto.gov.on.ca\/documents\/ltb\/Notices%20of%20Termination%20&amp;%20Instructions\/N4.pdf).\n\nConveniently, that form outlines _exactly_ what you need to do.\n\nHowever, they can give you that form the first day your rent is late, if they want. They don't have to give you 14 days before giving you notice - the date of termination has to be no earlier than 14 days from the date they _do_ give you notice.\n\nPay your rent. Let your landlord know that you expect to be given notice of termination in the legally-required form next time. Stop paying rent late unless you want to be evicted: persistently-late rent can be cause to terminate, once your lease expires."}

My roommate got really mad about this and told me she didn't want any of my guest in the apartment when i wasn't there. so my question is, does she have any legal right to kick guests out my room if i give them permission to be there? say for instance, if she calls the cops saying there is an intruder in the apartment, could my guest get arrested? I'm having guests stay with me soon and i am planning on them staying there while i'm not home and i would like to know if there might be any legal repercussions for this. Also, as far as i know there is nothing in my lease against doing this. I'm in California BTW\n","answer":" Your guest needs to leave when you leave. Your roommate absolutely doesn't have to deal with a stranger when you're not home. It's an unwritten rule of being a good roommate. Answer #2: &gt;  does she have any legal right to kick guests out my room if i give them permission to be there?\n\nUnless your lease has some very unusual rules about guest occupancy, the not.  You both have a right to the apartment if you're both on the lease.  \n\n&gt;  if she calls the cops saying there is an intruder in the apartment, could my guest get arrested?\n\nLegally, they aren't an intruder or trespasser.  But the cops won't know that if nobody is there saying otherwise, so it's not impossible that the police would ask them to leave.  It seems very unlikely they'd be arrested, but again, it's not completely impossible that it would happen because nobody is there in the moment to clear things up."}
{"question":"5 years ago, I met someone online in an online community about music and art. He was 17 at the time. I was 28. We started out as friends talking only online. 2 years later, him 19 and me 30, we met at an art event and we hit it off. \nLast year, we started a relationship. \nHe's 22, I'm 33. \nI understand that our relationship is not conventional but we are happy. But his parents does not approve and threaten me. \nTelling me that what I'm doing is illegal. Calling me a psychopath and other very mean things, calling me a creep and telling me I should date someone my age. My boyfriend is on my side. He doesn't like the way his parents are treating me. \n\nSo, is my relationship an illegal one? \n\nThank you. \n","answer":" You're both adults.  Bang away my friend, bang away.Answer #2: having a relationship with a minor is not illegal.  it's illegal to have sex with them while they are a minor.  so if you never had sex when he was 17, there's nothing to worry about.  Answer #3: You're both adults, so it's legal.Answer #4: Since he is not a minor, as long as he is not developmentally disabled, there is likely no legal barrier to your relationship. \n\nEven going by the \"Half your age plus seven\" rule of thumb, you're only one year off. So I don't think it's nearly as creepy as his parents are making it out to be. Assuming that you are a man, I'd wager to say that the idea that their son is gay is still fresh, and that's playing a lot into their attitude. If you're a woman, then disregard - it just means they're putting their nose where it doesn't belong (which is true in the other situation too). "}
{"question":"My boyfriend has been living with me for the last eight months. He isn't on the lease. He started contributing rent a couple months ago.

I had some social benefits and failed to report to the social security office when I got a job and kept I said benefits.Like I said dumb. I'm a kid in a man's body .But any one for advice or a place to get it. Sorry if I'm doing this wrong or this is the wrong place. I'm in the US.\n","answer":" Never paid taxes or never filed taxes?  That's two different things and everything depends on that.  \n\nMost people like you have standard w2 income so the withholding is done aka paid and then there's commonly a refund.   The IRS is very easy to work with as far as government agencies go.  \n\nThe people you hear with the massive tax issues are usually self employed and don't pay. That would be really uncommon for someone like you.  \n\nSo make a list of all the jobs you had about how much you made and make an appointment with an accountant.   \n\nThe possible issues here range from a return netting you some cash, breaking even to paying but I would feel it's more likely that you're closer to money in than out.  However your accountant will be your friend in this.  They're not free and you need them.  Your accountant will set your strategy but don't be surprised if you file for an extension and spend the summer cleaning this up.  I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep as you're making the correct decisions now.  \n\n\nAlso \/r\/personalfinance should be on your defaults from now on. Answer #2: Unless you have really high earnings, you aren't going to jail. \n\nI had a relative who genuinely believed that the income tax was unconstitutional. He vocally refused to file a return. After several years of arguing with the IRS, he was criminally charged in federal court.  His lawyer prepared and filed the missing returns. He would have received a refund if he had filed.  (You can't get a refund after 3 or 4 years or so.). Anyway, he got convicted but served no jail time. He only got prosecuted because he was vocal about it. \n\nGather the info and file the returns.

{"question":"Now that she's 18 her dad says we can't date because it's a class 1 misdemeanor in VA. Is this true? And is there any way around it? \n","answer":" You can date. You can't have sex (or do anything sexual in nature).Answer #2: Virginia's age of consent is 18. Their is no \"Romeo and Juliet\" exception in Virginia law. As I read this, she is 18 and you and either 16 or 17. Any sexual contact between you two will result in her being guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a $2,500 fine. She may also be required to register as a sex offender, which WILL ruin her life.\n\nThe is no way around this. By law you cannot consent to sexual contact with someone 18 or older until you are 18.

{"question":"Background: a doctor prescribed large amounts of drugs to my nephew who was 19. Nephew died from the drugs.

They are extremely interested and are investigating- but can’t give me any info on what happens next (understandable). They brought in states attorneys and an OIG guy too. \n\nQuestion is, do I need a lawyer myself for any reason? This is an extremely well known and popular doctor in the area- will they know I turned them in? \n\nDoes anyone know what to expect here? What is a DEA investigation like? It’s all so secretive and nobody can tell me anything. I’m so nervous and scared and wondering if this was the right thing to do.\n","answer":" Your anonymity should be held against this doctor.  Since you reported this to the DEA and they have started an investigation, the only things they may need from you is a statement or some evidence of the prescription.  After reporting stuff to any enforcement figure, it tends to be taken out of your hands and becomes a case between \"The Doctor vs. The DEA.\"  \n\n\nAs for secrecy of what info you're being given, the DEA also has to be cognizant of the doctor's rights and that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. They can't go around telling you everything they have if the doctor ends up being innocent.  \n\n\nYou most likely won't need a lawyer since you simply reported it and were not involved in the incident."}

Would the fact that my school is private mean that they can do this without consequence?\n","answer":" If the school accepts federal funds then Title IX applies. Whether this is prohibited discrimination depends on the exact nature of the event. For example, private clubs are allowed to discriminate based on sex so if this is a student organized event it may be legal (although it might violate school policy if conducted on campus). If it’s a school-organized event it probably isn’t legal, assuming the school is otherwise coed, but there are exceptions.\n\nIf the school doesn’t accept federal funds then Title IX doesn’t apply and the school can legally discriminate against students based on sex."}

If they decide he did he would be charged with murder like anybody else.\n\nIf they decide he didn't that would be his defence to the murder charge and they *may* find he didn't have the legal\/mental capacity to commit a crime.\n\nThe courts would then have to decide what to do with someone who was capable of committing murder but not capable of understanding it was wrong - there's a lot of things that could happen here but the most likely outcome is that he would be put in an institution (i.e. a psychiatric prison) until it was considered safe to release him - which could be months, or could be the rest of his life."}
{"question":"Hello,  \nHere's the scoop: my daughter's mother left three weeks ago with our kids. I was served custody papers the same day.  \nHer reasoning? Heroin addiction.  \nSo, confused and hurt, I filed my response and ordered a hair follicle drug test, which of course came back negative.  \nWe have mediation on Tuesday and I'm not really sure how to proceed. She has spent the past three weeks convincing herself, friends and family that I am a heroin addict (not only do I have a hair follicle test but I pay the rent, my home is clean, orderly and safe, I'm always on time to work, valued in my company, pay my bills, etc.)  \nSo my question is this: if this goes to trial, what is my best course of action? I have text messages from her detailing the emotional and psychological abuse she has put me through, as well as messages from her explaining how she does not love our daughter and has considered abandoning us\/devised a plan for doing so.\n","answer":" Your best coarse of action is to hire an attorney\n\nOther than that. Document everything and keep it very organized for court. Answer #2: Lawyer. Now. Right now. You need to make sure you have an attorney to make sure your drug test results are properly admitted if you go to court. You need a lawyer to help you show your ex is keeping the kids from you for no reason. These are serious allegations. Even if they are baseless, you do not want to fool around. Get a lawyer first thing Monday. "}

Didn't want to give them a hard time and get booked (which would immediately end my career considering I am 100% guilty) so I talked. Worked short term but how screwed am I long term?\n","answer":" Your level of screwed went up by a factor of 1000 when you talked.  \n\nUnless they have a video camera in the massage room, or the cooperation of the massage girl, they had absolutely ZERO evidence that you committed a crime until you gave it to them.   If they had a video camera or the cooperation of the attendant, you'd have never left the building - they'd have arrested you then and there.  \n\nYou may get lucky and never hear from them, but if they reach out...  it will be ENTIRELY because you talked."}

I do not want to spend another minute in jail, 6 hours was more than enough.\n","answer":" KS mandates that you change your license and registration after 90 days of establishing residency.\n\nDid you change your insurance address? It might be that NY has suspended your license and registration because you moved out of state."}
{"question":"I moved into an apartment 2 months ago and the hot water doesnt work. Per my lease it says all maintenance issues need to be requested in writing, and I email them every week about the issue but it gets ignored. Two weeks ago they had a plumber come by and installed a new thermostat on the heater and it fixed the issue temporarily ( 3 days ). I pay $1200 a month at this place and I'm under the impression that hot water being out makes the unit uninhabitable. I guess I'm going to get a new heater installed myself - and deduct it from rent. Is there anything I can do about the 2400 in rent I've paid already in an 'uninhabitable' apartment?   \n","answer":" From a brief google search, the LL has 7 days after written notice from you to fix the problem. If the LL does, then you can start witholding rent. But you must give proper notice and advise you will be withholding rent if the matter is not fixed. \n\n\nThe 7 day repair requirement is to certain habitability matters.

I probably won't ever be back at VT, do I necessarily need to pay the ticket?\n","answer":" VT and U.Va. are pretty good at getting the DMV involved.

What kind of situation would allow for this? I would imagine if the parents were deemed unfit for one child they would be unfit to care for their other children. \n","answer":" Complete guess : might be due to age difference?

{"question":"I am renewing my Captains license and one of the requirements is passing a drug test.  I went in for a test at Labcorp on Dec. 12 and was told that my results would be returned within 3 days.  Five days later I still had not received my results.  I was told to follow up directly with the lab they had sent my sample to.  When I called the lab to which I was referred, I received an answering machine stating that my call will be returned within 24 hours.  No returned call, even after multiple voicemails left over a week long period.  Called Labcorp again today only to be told that they had lost my sample and I would need to come in for a retest.  My renewal packet is due to the Coastguard next week or my license will expire and I'll have to go through the entire training course again.  Do I have any sort of recourse?\n","answer":" What is it, 2:30 pm in Hawaii?  Get yourself over to a Labcorp and tell a supervisor the situation.  See if you can retest right now.  They should have the results by the 2nd.Answer #2: Contact Labcorp for a higher up supervisor and expedite if you can. However, within a weekend, you might be limited. Can you contact the Coast Guard and ask them which protocol you need to follow? Answer #3: I promise you this has happened before and it's probably not all that bleak. So first things first- contact the Regional Exam Center in Honolulu  at (808)-522-8274.\n\nThey might redirect you to someone else at either the National Maritime Center or somewhere else. There may be a waiver process if it is that dire. \n\nPersonally, I doubt it is. I'm guessing when you first got your license you took a local course like Boatwise. Those are not requirements at the Federal level. The CG allows those to be taken in lieu of the CG exam. All other requirements are the same, which means you have the hours required to take the exam if your license truly does lapse.\n\nNow, I may be wrong about some of this due to state regulations and not knowing what class of masters license you have\/need, but no matter what, your first call should be to the REC."}

During this time they are expected to sleep on cots in hallways or empty rooms if some are available. They are not paid at all (not even a reduced rate) until their shift starts 13 hours later.\n\nMy question: Is this legal? I checked with some other friends who work for the same hospital system and they are hearing the same thing from their managers. So this is definitely an organizational thing and not just a rogue manager. \n","answer":" They have to be paid for all hours worked. That includes hours that they are \"engaged to wait\", which is what's happening here. If the powers that be refuse to pay, file a claim for unpaid wages with the FLSA.Answer #2: If it's mandatory they come in, it must be paid. This would be no different than if the hospital had a meeting and said they all must attend, then the speaker didn't show up. They would still get paid.\n\nYour friend should say they expect to get paid and then point out if they don't, they'll file a wage claim and get the hours and once the claim is filed it may trigger a wage audit.

{"question":"John Oliver appears to be named on much of the paperwork for the non-profit organization, but by having an actress appear as a fictitious wife, could this not be an instance of fraud\/deception that would undermine the otherwise carefully planned legitimacy of the organization?\n","answer":" a) It's a satire.

Could you go through and take all the fire extinguishers so they have to close down for safety reasons?\n\nIt's pretty niche, so I doubt many people are ever going to need to know, but I wondered whether there are rules on what you should reposess before you start taking items that are critical to keeping a business\/house safe and open.\n","answer":" Yes, in general the sheriff can help you repossess assets of the business, which will be sold at auction to pay off the judgment.\n\nBut the sheriff is not stupid.  The fire extinguishers are going to sell for $10, despite their original cost being much higher.  The sheriff is going to concentrate on cash and other things that convert easily into cash.\n\nSame deal with the IRS.  They can take anything to pay off your tax debt.  But they'll concentrate on bank accounts and yachts and gold bullion, not old pairs of gym socks.\n\nIt's not punitive.  You can't use it as a weapon to inflict extra injury.

They'll send you a free strip reader and you can opt to purchase a chip reader, but you can also type in the numbers manually and run the card that way.

{"question":"She wants a divorce and I knew it was bad. I cant say i didn't see this coming. I ripped the phone out of her hand. I know that wasn't a great idea but I couldn't help it. She climbed all over me and tried to get it back. She hidden the number under a women's name they have been talking alot with. I tried to give her the space she needed knowing it might not work. Long story short she will most likely file for divorce or should I? at this point. I told her to go to her mom's house or her new boyfriend's. I'm not going anywhere we just moved into our new home 3 months ago. Im keeping the kids for the weekend. I moved away from my home state less then a year ago to make her happy I have no one here for support. Should I change the locks put her stuff in boxes in the garage. She can go back to her supporting parents. While we figure out the law side of things. I'm working on getting an attorney ASAP.\n","answer":" You absolutely cannot kick her out, change the locks or ban her from the house.\n\nIf you want a divorce then consult a lawyer and get one.Answer #2: Do not change locks or move her things.  You cannot evict someone in that fashion who has a right to love there.  Contact a divorce attorney if you want to split up.\n\nStop grabbing phones and getting physical unless you want a domestic violence case on your record.  You will have a hard time keeping a job with DV on your record.Answer #3: You can't throw her out, or any of her things. You cannot change the locks. She is as entitled to the kids as you are. Get an attorney and follow his\/her advice, do not make anything worse between now and then."}
{"question":"California \n\nSo while my roommate was at school and I was gone for a moment, my girlfriend heard a commotion. Employees from my apartment complex entered into my apartment without a written notice, email, or phone call. My girlfriend heard a knock at the door but didn’t answer, then heard someone enter the apartment. She thought it was my roommate but turns out it was a male and female who used keys to enter our apartment. They claimed to see if the apartment was furnished (they offer furnished apartments for a higher price which I passed on for a cheaper price) which is in our contracts. After that, they checked to see if our locks on our bedrooms worked. My GF watched them the whole time. It makes me uneasy and I’ve never had to deal with this in the past. Is there any advice or any actions I am entitled to? Please help me out guys.\n","answer":" I would set up a camera or two inside when not home and see what happens as well.  I suspect there was something very different happening than checking the furniture.Answer #2: California has decent tenant privacy laws. You can find some info by Googling \"California Landlord Tenant PDF\" (I tried to link it, but Reddit didn't like the link)\n\nIf you choose to speak with the landlord, do it in writing so you've got the paper trail incase you need to escalate the situation. Answer #3: Call your landlord and remind them to give you notice in the future."}
{"question":"Hello,\nSo when I was born my mom believed a guy named Caleb to be my dad so he was put on my birth certificate (after he signed something as well). I never met him so I knew nothing about him. But earlier this year I took a DNA test via 23andme and matched with a guy named Jacob who turned out to be my actual father. Now that I know do I have to correct my birth certificate or can I just leave it alone?\n","answer":" Depends on how old you are and what you want.  If you are a minor, practically speaking, your mom would have to do everything if you wanted a change.  And it could certainly have child support implications for your newly named father.\n\nSince you didn’t list a location, I’m speaking with generalized US advice.   For more, we need your age, location, and to know if you know who your biological dad is.\n\nMost states won’t allow the removal of a father from the birth certificate of a minor unless a new father is named, that way if you go on welfare the state has someone to go after.\n\nAs an adult, birth father really only impacts inheritance and next of kin for medical decisions.  So no need to change anything.\n\nGive us a little more info and we’ll give you some clearer answers."}
{"question":"For work I pick up product from a storage facility. They usually have one elevator working at a time and todays elevator didn't go to my floor so somebody had to take me up when I was done doing what I had to I rang the elevator and nothing. I tried every elevator on the floor and waited. There's no was to know what floors the elevators are on or if they're coming up or not. So after waiting a while I wanted to go down a floor where all elevators go to see if I can catch the working one there and I found out that they lock all the doors to staircases. All emergency exits, and there's no fire escape. If I didn't have my phone to call downstairs I'd be locked in the top floor indefinitely even worst if there was a fire in the building. What do I do here who do I report this sort of thing to? It can't be legal.\n","answer":" Call the fire department.  They'll be happy to issue a ton of fines."}
{"question":"Hey Reddit, German law student here!\n\nI am writing a paper on the boundaries that german courts face, when they publish their decisions. In Germany these decisions are usually anonymized, to protect the identities of the people involved (f.e. Martin Brown would become M.B.).\n\nHowever, that is not the case in the US and many other jurisdictions (Brown v Baker etc.). So I wondered, what is the rationale behind stating the full names of the people involved (and not anonymising them), if there is any at all?\n","answer":" Names are typically only redacted in child custody matters or other situations where there is a risk of harm to the parties involved, such as domestic abuse cases.\n\nThe reason is that as a general rule in America we treat our court records as open public documents that anyone can access.  Unless there is a demonstrated danger or harm to publication of a name the fact that you were involved in a lawsuit isn’t in and of itself harmful and so to be as transparent as possible we keep the records fully open."}
{"question":"I work in ad sales. A few months ago I sold several ads to a client, invoiced them, and they never paid. Now my boss is telling me I'm responsible. At first I thought he meant repaying comission I earned, but then he clarified that I am actually responsible for repaying the full sale price of their ads (~$5k total), and that we will discuss a \"plan for me to pay it off\" on Monday.\n\nIs that legal?\n","answer":" No. That is not at all legal. The client is responsible for the incursion of any and all debt as a result of services provided at their request. The \"plan\" your boss should have should be for him to contact the company attorney to discuss a lawsuit or other legal actions against the client."}

But when I call with *67 it goes through leading me to believe that she has blocked my number. Should I call again with *67 and confront her about blocking my number?

I'm mostly leaning towards a lawsuit but I have no idea on how to get that started and I really really do not want to not do that unless it's my last option.\n\nCalifornia \n","answer":" Do NOT go to their house.

{"question":"I was involved in a hit and run. The driver was found as of today... just over a month after the accident. The detective gave me his insurance information. \n\nI contacted a lawyer because my insurance company refused to cover the accident. I broke my arm and needed surgery. I am out about $6000 for the car plus medical expenses. I do have health insurance under my parents so my main concern was the value of the car. Now that I have the driver's insurance information, is it necessary to continue with the lawyer? \n\nI just don't want to get screwed out of 33% of the value of the car because I went with a lawyer. I imagine I could get something for the arm injury, but I'm not trying to drag this out and screw over this guy. \n\n\nTopic:\nPersonal Injury\n","answer":" You don't *need* a lawyer. But having a lawyer may be helpful in negotiations with the driver's insurance company.\n\nKeep in mind that you may owe this lawyer some compensation, depending on how far your case went with them. Check any agreements you made to be sure."}
{"question":"So a friend of mine got a girl pregnant. Hes still in high school and she had an abortion. The girls parents want him to pay for all of it. He and I both think he should only pay for half since it takes two to have a baby. Is there anyway they can force him to pay for all of it or even any of it? We live in Florida by the way if that makes a difference. Thankyou for your help in advance. Hes very stressed out and I'm trying to help.\n","answer":" Legally? The abortion was the choice of the girl and\/or her parents. Your friend *should* have no responsibility. IANAL.\n\nEthically? Like you said, it takes two to make a baby, and so long as it was consentual, your friend should pay half of it, because it was both people's decision.Answer #2: He doesn't  have to pay for any of it since it was the gf's choice to have the abortion. The right thing would be to pay for half. If they did decide to sue over it (which i don't know what they would sue for), it would be taken to small claims court. As long as your friend didn't sign anything saying he'd pay 100% of it, then they wont win. \n"}

I signed a contract and got a used Jeep Cherokee. We got the car the next day after getting the insurance. We got the keys and they said everything was all good to go. Now we are getting text messages telling us we are being forced to go back and sign a new contract with lower payments. They didn't go into detail much. After we declined they said we had no choice and if we didn't go they would take the car back. It's my first time buying a car and I'm young so im extremely worried they are taking advantage of me. I remember signing a paper that said I wasn't allowed to get an attorney if things were to go south. \n\nSo now I'm freaking out and I don't know if they're trying to scam me or something.

Is there a case the step mother can make for custody worth putting up the fight for?\n\nDivorce was 50\/50 of property. Adoption\/guardianship was not affordable at the time. Grandma has moved into the house where ex-husband lived, where the kids still live (9,13,14,17). Eldest will turn 18 in August. Nothing in the divorce about the kids. Grandma is kind of crazy.\n\n","answer":" If she has been raising them all this time, and the kids want to stay with her, odds are really good that they can.  Especially considering that she had custody of them post-divorce, it sounds like.\n\nAs a life advice, the best bet is to talk to the grandma and see if you can work out a positive visitation schedule, so that she feels appreciated and has time with her grandkids, without disrupting those kids' lives further.  They've lost both their birth parents, that's pretty rough. "}

{"question":" My ex girlfriend and I had an apartment together and when things ended between us I told her I was going out of state to get settled somewhere new and would come back for my dog and other personal items after I was settled and had the money to fly my dog back with me.   \n\n\nWe maintained contact the whole time. I sent her money for food and flea medication, as well as sent money to my dog sitter who watched him during the days.   \n\n\nIts now been a month, I'm finally settled in and have a new job. my ex contacted me a few days ago saying that she didn't want to watch my dog anymore and I arranged for my mom to pick him up yesterday.   \n\n\nUpon arrival we learned that she sold my dog to the dog sitter who has no intention of ever giving him back to me. They said they waited for 30 days before making the sale legal.   \n\n\nWhat steps do I need to take to get my dog back? Can she leggaly do that?   \n\n\nShe knew i was coming back and I'm so shocked and blindsighted. \n","answer":" Find any evidence you have you own the dog. Adoption papers, vet bills, photos, whatever.\n\nContact the police, file a police report for theft. Dogs are considered property and no amount of \"waiting 30 days\" makes it legal to sell something that does not belong to you OR legal to keep something you bought that was actually stolen.\n\nFind out the name or address of the person the dog was sold to. Go ask them to give it back. Sometimes the police will come with you to get it.Answer #2: You're allowed to leave your property with someone else who offers to look after it while you are temporarily looking for a new place. Likewise, the person watching your property has the right to decide they no longer want to watch your property and let you find someone else who will or let you come retrieve it. In no circumstances are they allowed to sell your property to someone else, nor is someone in this situation able to legally acquire ownership of your property from such a sale.\n\nSo you have an ex who illegally sold your property, and you have a pet sitter who knowingly bought your property from someone who does not have the right to sell it.\n\nCall the police for whatever area your ex\/pet-sitter reside and file a report for theft of property. Best case: they surrender your dog; Worst case: you need to sue the Pet Sitter to return your dog."}
{"question":"My wife is an employed professional (exempt).  Her employer is doing some renovations to the office.  Apparently there were not enough funds to do everything her \"boss\" (company has a very ambiguous org chart) wanted.  Therefore, the boss is expecting all of professionals in the office to share the cost of artwork she wants on the walls.  The artists are approved by the company although there do not seem to be any apparent ethical safeguards against kickbacks and such.  It is unclear who would actually \"own\" the art.\n\nI have tried to google about the legality of this but always find charity donation scenarios instead of directly buying things for the company.  It seems like there would be some employment laws against this?  However, I realize exempt employees have very few protections relative to others.  Thank you for any help.\n","answer":" Well, they can't \"force\" her to buy the artwork, nor can they take money out of her paycheck to pay for it without her consent.\n\nBut \"at will employment\" means that she can be fired for any reason or no reason at all (except membership in a protected class) so, as stupid as it sounds, she could actually be fired over this. \n\nHow do the other professionals in the office feel about this idea? One person saying no it likely to go poorly for that person, but multiple people saying no might tie their hands more. \n\nHaving said that though, I'd be highly concerned about the solvency of her employer (both now and into the future) if they can't even complete a renovation without running out of funds.

Do I lawyer up and sue the guy cause I need a replacement car. Or talk to his insurance cause he's at fault? Help.\n","answer":" You're entitled to the current market value of the car, plus any contents, OR the cost of repair -- nothing more.

{"question":" Do you charge friends for legal services?\nQuestion:I'm a pretty new Texas lawyer. Do you charge friends for stuff like filing suits or short court appearances? Thanks!\n","answer":" IANAL but my sister is. She charges family only for filing fees or actual costs for minor legal problems, but absolutely will not get involved with large legal issues. She does this tactfully, by saying she wouldn't be comfortable working on areas outside of her expertise. She has a great list of specialist attorneys she sends folks to, and she does this so gracefully, you'd never know she's just said no. For friends, she might send them information links along with the referral, but she doesn't file anything or even offer legal advice.\n\nAs I'm sure you already know, you're now **the** go-to person for all legal problems, much as I'm sure doctors are. If you don't establish boundaries immediately, you're screwed. Final piece of advice, if you don't value your time, no one else will. \n\nCongratulations on getting your law degree! Answer #2: Are you working for a firm?  If yes they almost certainly have a policy on this that involves running a conflict check and getting approval for pro bono work.  If you shortcut the firm's process you won't be covered by their malpractice insurance, which is a bad idea."}
{"question":"Hi, i just received a speeding ticket and needed some advice. The ticket was for 91 in a 50 zone, i was stopped by the city police officer and was able to provide license, registration and insurance. The officer was pretty cool after he realized i was just a stupid teenager. He only cited me for speed but i have to appear in court. This was my 3rd ticket in 6 months in ohio. My question i guess is how screwed am i as far as keeping my license? Will a lawyer be able to help me keep school and work privileges?  I honestly have learned my lesson this time. I will probable sell my civic si and get the slowest vehicle possible if i can still drive. This will be i. The mayors court this Wednesday. Thanks.\n","answer":"  If you want to save your license you should get a lawyer. Even then I kind of doubt it. Have you done the math on speeding? Unless you're traveling something close to 500 miles it doesn't end up making much of a difference.  Between stoplights, traffic, and rest stops you don't get that much of a time advantage – particularly considering the enhanced risk of a ticket. \n\nIf you lose your license it will be what you deserve.  Three speeding tickets in six months is insane. I was a crazy teenager and I didn't even get close to that. That means you are way, way over the line. Your insurance costs will go through the roof. \n\n Still, You need to max out your liability coverage. $250,000 or $1 million minimum. Driving at 91 miles an hour if you get into a collision with another car you can ruin many lives. You don't want a judgment of that size hanging around your neck for the rest of your life.Answer #2: You're young with no experience. Your license is toast, my friend.\n\nIt's one thing to speed, but it's another to intentionally put lives in danger. If you were in Virginia, you would be a criminal.Answer #3: 3rd in 6 months? Plus driving 40 mph over the limit. \n\nYou can get a lawyer but I don't think you should bother. You're already at a disadvantage because you're young and you deserve to lose your license for a while IMO"}
{"question":"I live in an apartment in Upstate New York. When we moved in we requested dead bolts on the doors but that request was met with silence. We found our basement door only had a small slide lock that could easily be bypassed. We opted to put a pad lock on the outside door leading into the basement. We recently found our landlord removed the latch on the backdoor, essentially giving outside access into our apartment.\n\nMy question is since we do not feel safe and we'd made requests to add additional security to our apartment is there any possible legal recourse?\n\nThank you for your time. \n","answer":" Not having a working lock for your door is a violation of NY State's Implied Warranty of Habitability, just like if the apartment didn't have heat or was infested with vermin. Your steps are to inform the LL, in writing, of the problem and that it needs to be fixed. If the LL doesn't fix it, you can sue him for a rent reduction (or withhold rent, but this latter course tends to make people really angry and it's best to have the law on your side first).

So maybe you guys can help me answer some questions on how applications would affect a female divorcee and a male divorcee.\n\nIn terms of applications, be it DMV, job, school, buying car, leasing business, etc where the question asked \"What is your marital status?\":\n\n1. Are you required to expand on this with details? With whom? When? How long? Why?\n\n2. What if you put single even though you had a divorce?\n\n3.

If it's either single or married and your divorce is final, then you aren't legally married any more so put \"single\".\n\nNot a lawyer, but I am divorced and that's the reasoning I use.\n\n1. Nobody has ever asked for any additional information.\n2. If you are not currently legally married to someone, you are single. The past history of being married or not is irrelevant.\n3.

{"question":"I was driving down S Lowry street in Smyrna TN when a driver pulled out of a bar right in front of me. I slammed on my brakes but unfortunately was unable to avoid a collision.

I'm trying to understand all my legal options and which course of actions is most beneficial. \n","answer":" Have you contacted your insurance company?  Did you call the police and did they make a report?  \n\nJust because the guy was drunk and on his cell phone doesn't mean that he is solely liable for the collision.  \n\nTo your edit:  \n\n&gt;My Sentra was totalled and the insurance appraisers aren't providing me with enough funds to pay off what I owe on the vehicle.\n\nThe insurance will only pay you fair market value of what the car is worth right before it was damaged.  If that value is lower than what you owe, there's nothing you can do.  You should have had gap insurance on it.  \n\nYou can sue the other driver for any damages you may have.  But if your full fair market value is being paid by your insurance company you can't sue the other driver for that because you've already been made whole by your insurance.

{"question":"Throwaway for reasons - \n\nTo preface this, my brother works in finance for a car dealership. Every finance deal he does with a certain bank, he is awarded $100 from the dealership. As a company, if they hit a collective goal with that bank they get lower interest rates which is why they give individuals the $100 incentive. \n\nIn September, my brother completed 5 deals with said bank, and received the $500 on his November 1st paycheck. In October, he completed 13 deals totaling $1300. His paycheck he received on December 1st was only for $800, citing a $500 deduction. They deducted his September deals because they implemented a new policy on 11\/29 stating that if the company didn't reach their collective goal, incentives wouldn't be paid out. \n\nSo my question is, can they deduct something they already paid him, for a new rule they just enacted? \n\nLet me know if this wasn't clear. First time posting here. \n","answer":" Location matters a lot here. Generally if he earned it under the old rule he's due it.Answer #2: It may vary by state but as a rule of thumb your employer can’t deduct anything from your paycheck without your signature or a government orderAnswer #3: Depends on location. \n\nIn some places bonuses &amp; commission that aren't written into the employment contract are completely up to the employer and can be revoked at **any** stage up to and including the date of payment.\n\nNow while this means they can't retroactively take back Septembers pay, they can in effect do the same thing by taking the $500 off the October bonus for any and no reason that doesn't fall under a protected class (i.e. not a reason that would give rise to a discrimination suit).Answer #4: Side issue - is the bonus to the dealership fully disclosed to the buyers? Steering buyers to a specific lender is explicitly prohibited in real estate under RESPA - are the kickbacks for auto lenders likewise illegal or are they ok?"}

We were both shocked when she was told that by the Air Force recruiter.  The charge was a felony assault on a police officer from 11 years ago (She spit at an officer) which was dismissed.

As odd as it sounds it happens, I can attest to not remembering a damn thing about a charge I was picked up on as a child but remember it involved community service, and I'm an attorney myself. It sounds to me that when she says \"dismissed\" she is recalling that the charge was either subject to something like a conditional discharge or an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal. Community service is often required by the DA in exchange for the offer. So, she may be fine with the armed services after all. She should go to the clerk of the county\/city where the offense was committed and ask, if they cant tell her with a quick search she should request a copy of her DCJS or whatever your state's equivalent of a rap sheet is. \n\nThe \"dismissed charge would be wiped in 5 years\" part also sounds like a misremembrance.

If you can prove she's actually committed adultery, it might impact spousal support, but that's it.Answer #2: If you confront her in this, all that you accomplish is to inform her that you know about *this* incident. If she's determined to cheat--and her making plans to do so while you're out certainly suggests it--then the next time will be better hidden from you. Further, you also inform her that any divorce proceedings should happen on **her** terms, not yours; you'll probably be back in here in due time asking for advice to handle that mess. Finally, depending on how this confrontation plays out, you could well find yourself in the backseat of a squad car being taken in for a domestic incident charge of some sort.\n\nEdit: While those texts may not affect your divorce and\/or custody efforts, a domestic charge accompanied by a protective order damn sure will, so that's another reason to not even get into anything with her.\n\nJust avoid that crap, go see your attorney. This is going to be a shitshow regardless, make it as stress-free and quick for yourself as you can."}
{"question":"I've been dumpster diving at this strip mall for a couple of months now, and one of the business owners(I believe) said I could dumpster dive there(1 dumpster).

How should I precede?\n","answer":" In general that is to keep people from dumping stuff into it, not taking it out"}
{"question":"My wife recently filed for divorce in retaliation to me declining to sign agreement forms for embryo adoption a month after she moved out due to years of an unhappy marriage (following 4 years of infertility struggles, depression, etc.). The embryo adoption would be scheduled for Oct-Nov so she needs a divorce ASAP in order to be the only required signature on the adoption forms as my state (Illinois) requires a 6 month separation period before granting divorce. In order to bypass this, she has cited emotional abuse and drug abuse as the reasons for divorce.\n\nMy question is, does this have any implications for me? Are there any legal ramifications to me if I just agree to the divorce on these terms? I am willing and likely able to fight the accusations but if it doesn't have any impact on me, I'd rather get out immediately.\nTopic:\nCustody Divorce and Family\n","answer":" Not from Illinois, so I don't know specific divorce laws.\n\nThat said, in many states, there are likely implications as far as how things such as alimony and property division would be determined if the divorce was under conditions that implicate you having broken the law (i.e. drug abuse, even if you don't get 'charged' with it, would tend to be something the court wouldn't look kindly on.)\n\nSounds like you should lawyer up, however. I get the feeling that otherwise she will first, and you'll be more likely to wind up paying for that too."}

{"question":"Hello! I am going to be a high school senior, in New York State. Recently some guys in my grade made fake porn, using photoshopped pictures of me and my friends (ie: they put our faces on porn stars’ bodies, and labeled with our full names). These aren’t just naked, but really gross, graphic stuff. The pictures have been posted on different social media accounts. The tumblr one got taken down, but then they made another account. \n\n\nI don’t want to tell my parents, because it’s too embarrassing, but if I call the police, will they find out? Also there are rumors about who did it, but no one has proof. \n","answer":" You can and should report this to the police.  While “fake” porn is generally legal, when it depicts an individual who is actually under age it may be actionable.  That said, if the police investigate it will likely result in your parents finding out.  The thing is, you have don’t absolutely nothing wrong, so while it might be embarrassing, hopefully your parents are understanding and helpful.Answer #2: You should tell your parents. You didn’t do anything wrong and have nothing to be embarrassed about.  \n\nAnswer #3: Report it to the police, in most cases, simulated pornography is treated like the real thing. If any of the pictures of you and your friends are from before you're 18, the people uploading the pictures could be investigated for underage pornography.\n\nConsider that people who do this are often stalkers and abusers. Girls have committed suicide over stuff like this being done to them. You need to have no sympathy for the people who did this. Report it to the police."}
{"question":"So last night me and my friend got pulled over for \"failure\" to make a stop at the stop sign. Anyways, the smell of weed coming from the car is undeniable, as soon as the cop got to the window he asked us where to weed was. Eventually after calling a another unit they found everything. We had around 30-35 grams on us and 600-700 dollars, they took us in for possession to sell. I was put in jail and bailed out by my brother at 5 am. They kept our phones for evidence, which I'm very worried about.\n\nI just turned 20 and his is my first marijuana possession\/drug charge, what are my options? Am I facing any time?

Grant him a license to use the land and you'll be fine; although that raises the possibility of him claiming an easment by estoppel."}

{"question":"For about a week now, I’ve been CIT for a camp I went to myself for about 5 years before (ages of campers there range from 8-15) . My last year as a camper, a kid in my age group was caught trying to force himself onto a younger girl. Two years on, and he was allowed back as a CIT after a year long process they had in place. He’s been here a week and that process has clearly failed. He shoplifted a store we visited but the camp director said that because he wasn’t caught when doing it and the store alarms didn’t go off, they can’t kick him out even though a staff member and a camper witnessed it and a bag of Cheetos magically appeared in our living area. On top of that, most of the other CITs don’t know about his past can see he’s very unstable. (Manipulation and gross sexual comments) Apparently the staff are still “in talks” on if he should be allowed to stay.

How they behave, who does what, when, where, for how long, who spends more time away, with you and so on. They have to assess who’s gonna be a better fit for you.

So doesn't Twitter have the only other rights to the picture to distribute it and publicize it?\nWhat I'm trying to find out if there is anything she can get out of this and if it is even worth it to take legal action?\nthanks! :D\n","answer":" You should be able to file an App Store dispute which notifies both the seller and Apple about the issue.

{"question":"Coming home on Halloween I was pulled over on a stretch of highway where the speed limit drops from 65 to 55 on the freeway for doing what the cop at the time said was 86 mph. It is fairly difficult for my car to do 86 mph and I very rarely drive over 70 so I am very doubtful I was actually doing that speed and feel like I was screwed over by a cop taking advantage of someone on Halloween night and at the end of the month. My court date is January 20th because you have to attend for super speeder tickets. Just wondering if there's any way of fighting it or getting it reduced since I really do feel wronged here. I was also given a breathalizer because he thought I was drunk but I passed it. I think he may have been agitated that I was not drunk when he pulled me over.\n","answer":" &gt;  Just wondering if there's any way of fighting it\n\nThe ticket should have instructions on the process for challenging it.  You're free to do that.\n\nHaving said that, a large issue with your defense is that you don't actually know how fast you were going.  The officer will testify that you were going 86, based upon whatever means he measured that.  Your rebuttal testimony will be, effectively, \"No way, dude!\"  That doesn't generally work very well.\n\nAlso, you should refrain from complaining about \"getting screwed\" when you were stopped for speeding.  You admit you were going *at least* 15 miles over the limit.  Judges generally don't like when people whine about getting caught red-handed."}

Don't even use the same pattern of passwords (if you had been using character names from a favourite show, don't use character names from any show you watch), and set recovery questions\/answers to things he doesn't know about. Reason for the factory reset is to wipe out keyloggers - any device to which he's had physical access is suspect until examined by a professional and cleared.

Factory reset wipes out installed programs, including software keyloggers."}
{"question":"I thought this was a really interesting question that \/u\/oddun posed elsewhere. As an EU citizen, is the government allowed to strip my EU citizenship and rights without my consent? I thought it was an interesting legal question and wonder the validity of such an argument if someone wanted to take it to court. \n\nIt seems like this would be pretty illegal to me, especially considering the government is refusing to allow this to go to a parliamentary vote. Considering I voted remain, and under no terms do I want to leave the EU on a personal level, regardless of the country as a whole, would someone be able to take that argument to court and have a case?\n\nAlso, this isn't a political question, it's more of a 'what if' scenario, genuinely interested to see what people have to say!\n\nI thought maybe someone here would be able to answer this, as it is not something I have seen posted anywhere else. Thanks!\n","answer":" Honestly, that's something that no one can answer right now because there is no precedent, as no nation has ever left the EU. It's a question that will no doubt be hashed out in the EU councils and most likely the courts for a long time to come. \n\nThe best argument that I could see is that there is technically no such thing as an \"EU citizenship\" because the EU is not a sovereign state as such; it's a confederation of individual sovereign member states (albeit one with some federal characteristics). \"EU citizenship\" is just a shorthand way of saying \"citizenship of a state that is a member of the EU.\" If the state of which you are a citizen secedes from the confederation, then you would no longer be a citizen of a member nation and thus no longer part of the EU, simple as that. \n\nOf course, practically speaking, even with the hardest of hard Brexits, with no freedom of movement or trade and no EU influence over British law, there will no doubt be accommodations made in certain situations, such as granting some sort of residency rights to British citizens already living in other EU states. In general though, British citizens can't really remain \"EU citizens\" if Britain leaves the EU. "}
{"question":"So I'm not too familiar with employment\/labour law in Ontario, Canada (where we're from) and I'm asking this for my mom. She worked for a company for 2 months (she passed the 1 month probation period) and was told she would have 2 weeks of vacation a year. As it got closer to tax season she was asked to work overtime (she accumulated around 100 hours) and was to be compensated with more vacation time. However, after 2 months, she made a mistake with payroll confirmation (it did not go through on pay day) and was subsequently fired. They paid her for her normal hours but told her that because she was paid monthly and that her overtime was to be compensated with vacation days, she will not be getting money for the overtime hours she worked. But because she's no longer employed she can't even use those vacation days. \n\nIs this legal? Is she entitled to those overtime hours? \n","answer":" She can be fired for making a mistake, and since she was only there for 2 months, there is no statutory requirement for payment in lieu of notice.  \n\nYou mentioned tax season, so she should be aware that there are some occupations that are exempt from overtime provisions, such as CPAs. If she is not exempt, she should make sure that she does not have an averaging agreement, because that could impact the amount of overtime she is owed.\n\nOntario does allow employers, with written permission from employees, to provide vacation time instead of payment for overtime, but the employer still must follow the rules - i.e. if the time should be paid at time and a half, it should be accumulated at time and a half as well.\n\nCall the Ministry of Labour to get this sorted out."}

{"question":"A month ago I received a letter served at work letting me know my ex has a baby and I am to take a paternity test. I absolutely had no idea she was even pregnant. Long story short, I am the father. I do want to have a relationship with my daughter. I've spoken to the mother and she is willing to work with me to establish parenting time and negotiate child support, insurance, etc. My question is, what items do people typically negotiate in terms of money. For example, does the mother automatically get to claim the child on her taxes in MI? I obviously will cover the child with my health insurance, but if the mother agrees to receive less in the way of monthly child support,  could I offer up to pay half on braces, glasses, pay the 20&amp;#37; of her health care needs, and give mom every year to claim child?  We've spoken to a couple of different lawyers, and we are definitely working on retaining one, but in the meantime, I hoped I could get some clarity on these subjects here. \n","answer":" There isn’t really a negotiation with respect to money. There’s a statutory calculation that takes into account the income of both parents and sets an amount. \n\nYour order is very likely to be at or near the amount set by the calculator. Answer #2: Wait, are you consulting lawyers together or separately? I'd consult a lawyer on your own. Answer #3: You’ll both figure out a schedule or set amounts as to who does what and when while you’re in mediation. Answer #4: To add what others have said, it’s really less of a negotiation than a calculation. If you split custody 50\/50, child support is not needed. If she has more than 50% custody, you’ll pay child support based on your incomes. You can take things like providing health insurance into account when meeting this responsibility. \n\nThe parent who was the child for 183 days or more gets to claim her on their taxes. If you are attempting to split custody 50\/50, some parents take turns claiming the child every other year, that can be formalized in your custody agreement. "}
{"question":"Texas \n\nI work at a human tissue processing company. I've worked at this place for a long time.

The company was bought by a company with locations all over the world, and the agreement is now that we cannot work at any tissue bank or similar business ANYWHERE in the world. This seems ridiculous, especially since the skills and experience in a job like this are very niche and not really applicable in any other job position.

We have a city ordinance curfew that forbids anyone under 16 to be on the public streets after 11:00pm.\n","answer":" Yes, you can sue the parents for any damage which is not paid by your insurance.  I would name both parents and child in any lawsuit.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/new-york-parental-responsibility-laws.html\n\nRemember, the first step is to request or demand that your uncompensated costs are paid.

{"question":"My grandmother was looking for someone to help rework her kitchen before expanding it. She found someone on Facebook and he had pictures of past work I guess so she \"hired\" him.\n\nThey met and he charged her an initial $4,000 down payment. Come the following day she can't get ahold of him at all. This continued for a week, now a month. She filed a police report today but was told without a correct name this could go cold.\n\nIs that really it? Can she give them his Facebook or something? $4,000 isn't a terrible loss to her thankfully (was always financially savvy) but it's infuriating someone could do this and get away with it.\n\nFwiw she did do some research into this guy. He had a professional looking site and client reviews we see are now bullshit. So he did LOOK legitimate. His Facebook and website are both gone now.......\n","answer":" How did she pay him (cash, card, check, etc)? Depending on the answer your might have some fraud protections through your bank and it would be worth talking to them.Answer #2: Sounds like a scam. There's a reason why there are so many scammers out there and that's because it's so difficult for the police to pursue them. You can push this up the chain with the police department, but I doubt it will go much further. \n\nIn the future, only hire contractors that are insured and bonded. There are many legitimate websites out there that have reviews for contractors in your area.Answer #3: &gt;Fwiw she did do some research into this guy. He had a professional looking site and client reviews we see are now bullshit. So he did LOOK legitimate.

{"question":"My question is pretty much as my post title states. My wife and I had a baby recently. I missed the enrollment window to add my child to my plan and I am being told I now have to wait until our yearly open enrollment to add my kid. \n\nI am going to take this up with HR and ask for forgiveness for the sake of my newborn, but I'd like to know if there are any relevant laws regarding the legality of refusing to allow the addition of a dependent based on what seems like an arbitrary corporate policy.\n\nThis is in Pennsylvania. \n\nAlso, my wife is a SAHM so we don't have an option on her end for insurance.\n\nThanks\n","answer":" If it's 60 days it's not arbitrary at all nor is it their policy but rather the law. They can't add her once the 60 day window has passed.  You can beg but you have no leg to stand on. 60 days is 60 days.Answer #2: It is likely the insurance company that is not allowing it. Your HR department probably has no control over that whatsoever. Answer #3: Yes they can legally make you wait."}
{"question":"Backstory: I got my two bottom wisdom teeth removed yesterday and today i still have heavy numbness on the left side of my bottom lip and chin.

Some patients have residual issues for months. It’s a risk of surgery. Also you should know that the nerve involved runs from the back of the mouth all the way to the front teeth.

{"question":"He didn't reside with me or lease or anything.  He was just staying the night a few times and put some of his work things in the shed (I didn't know what he put in there).  We broke up and he said he was coming for his things but never did.  I had them on the curb for him the first night.  The next day I moved them to the driveway and covered them with plastic so they wouldn't get stolen or wet.  Today (day 3) everything is still there.  I notified him and his father that the belongings were there waiting and even told them when I wouldn't be home if they wanted to pick them up (my ex said he would prefer to not see me).  I'm wondering how long I have to keep this stuff on my property since he wasn't a tenant and he's not responding to my requests for him to come get it.  It's ladders, lots of painters drop cloths, paint poles and supplies.\nTopic:\nOther Civil Matters\n","answer":" Send him a certified letter saying that he has 15 days to pick up his stuff and after that you'll consider them abandoned. Answer #2: Though he isn't a tenant, you allowed him to store the property. If you're asking can you sell it on CL, that's a good way to get sued. I would put it back in the shed and let him contact you to make arrangements. Since you removed them and left them outside, if they are damaged or stolen, you're liable. Answer #3: Another option is to pay for self-storage, move the stuff into it, give him the key and inform him that a month has been paid for. He can move it or allow the self-storage people auction it off in a month. Change your locks so that he just doesn't let himself back in and call the police if they do break in."}

{"question":"We lost our child while traveling on an international flight from Toronto to Delhi. The child was about 6 months old. He collapsed, and died about 1 hour before the flight landed.\n\nAn autopsy report indicated that cause of death was 'asphyxiation.' The airline said they did a curtsy investigation and did not take any responsibility for the incident. Even their letter on the matter was full of factual errors. My wife and I moved on. However, I wonder if I can still file a case\/writ to:\n\na) Hold the Airline legally accountable\n\nb) Claim compensation for Emotional Harm and Mental Suffering\n\nThe incident happened in June 2008. Is there a statute of limitations ?\n","answer":" Sorry for your loss, but the real question here is how do you think the airline asphyxiated your child?Answer #2: I am terribly sorry for you loss. \n\nIt is highly doubtful there is a theory in which you have not exceeded the statute of limitations to bring a suit. What is more important to consider is if you would have had strong evidence thr airline caused the asphyxiation. The word means loss of breath; how was this due to the airline's negligence? \n\nIf the child had a medical emergency, anyone on the flight who responded would have been a passenger volunteer. Airlines do not keep medical personnel on flights in part to *avoid* this type of liability, but there are ground physicians who give orders and assume medical liability for acts of people who have medical qualification to intervene. They are not airline employees, either. \n\nYou should always speak with an attorney about all relevant facts to be sure, but I suspect this might not be viable to pursue. \n\nAgain, you have my depends condolences.  Answer #3: A claim in Ontario would have had to have been filed within two years of the date the claim arose (Limitations Act 2002, SO 2002, section 4). I expect any claim in Delhi will have the same issue. In short: _even if you have a viable claim_, you've almost certainly waited too long.\n\nSpeak to an attorney to be sure, but I am not optimistic."}

{"question":"So I just got a new job at a tutoring company in upstate New York (test prep for ACT\/SAT mostly) and when I tell people they will call me in and pay me for just an hour a day, some point out that it might not be legal. I'm unfamiliar with these kinds of laws. So is it legal to call an employee in for a single hour shift?\n","answer":" It's not illegal, it's just part of the tutoring game. As someone who has tutored, my advice is up your clients and pack your schedule as best you can. Realistically, get a part-time job and limit your tutoring hours to the peak times. I don't know anyone who has managed to tutor full-time, since most families can only afford 1-2 hours a week and there's heavy competition. \n\nA 20hr\/week job supplements your income nicely, and enables you to fill those pesky non-peak hours, like weekdays. Odds are, you won't lose many clients by cutting those hours out entirely. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, if you're allowed to set your own rate, don't undercut everyone. The reason tutoring prices are inflated is because many of them are self-employed, which has lots of tax implications and comes with the side effect of having very strange schedules. Also, the inconvenience of being hired in 1-2 hour increments is included in the price. I charged $35\/hr while working retail for $8\/hr part time. I rarely worked more than 5 tutoring hours a week."}

Would your records be immediately sealed or something?\n","answer":" My understanding in most jurisdictions is that, if you would have been charged as a minor at the time the crime was committed, you will still be charged that way even if you are an adult at the time of the arrest. \n\nAlso: the statute of limitations for most felonies is Connecticut is 5 years. So, if the theft happened more than 5 years before the arrest, they cannot prosecute."}
{"question":"Hey all, I was wondering if somebody could perhaps help provide me with some insight. So I recently found out that my cousin was arrested twice within the past year in New York. \n\nFor the first arrest he was charged with PL 155.35 01 and PL 170.10 01 . The second more recent arrest was a single charge of PL 155.35 01 .\n\nHe really hasn't been providing information on what happened but some family members think it could be the result of passing bad checks. I was hoping if somebody could enlighten me on if that would make sense? \n\nThank you!\n","answer":" Grand larceny. And if he doesn't want to talk about it that's his business and probably the smart thing to do."}
{"question":"from my roamings of r\/legaladvice, It appears outside a sperm bank it is impossible to sign away any connection to a child whatsoever. Even if the mother doesnt pursue child support, any state aid has a bill go to the father  (or mother, whatever)\n\nwhat happens in porn? birth control isnt 100% effective and Im sure abortons are common. but if the new starlet wishes to keep the child is the other actor on the hook? do they have porn baby insurance in case it happens? \n\nIve googled this and found less than informative responses. \n","answer":" Generally, they get an abortion. Professional pornographic actors have a personal interest in their own reproductive health for a bunch of mostly-obvious personal _and_ professional reasons, and an unplanned pregnancy is a big deal.\n\nIf they carry the child to term, there's nothing particularly magic about being a porn star. If they don't know who the father is, they can seek paternity tests. If the state wants to seek support on their behalf, the state can subpoena the mother for the list of candidate fathers. It doesn't matter if that's one man or hundreds.\n\nIf the child is born and paternity can be established, the father is on the hook. There are no insurance plans that cover 18 years of child-rearing expenses for porn stars.Answer #2: &gt; if the new starlet wishes to keep the child is the other actor on the hook?\n\nYes, and I'm aware of at least a few instances of this happening. In at least one of them, the two performers got married soon after and are still together today."}

{"question":"I have sister of 25 years of age with a severe learning disability who is also nonverbal. She was admitted tonight at a hospital for a kidney infection and stones. My mother and I share her conservatorship for many things, including her medical decisions, which we thought meant our mother could stay and watch her for signs of pain or needing attention from the nurses. We learned no one could stay with her due to rules they have in the hospital. We explained she would not be able to call for a nurse or tell someone if something hurts or if she needs assistance, but we were still informed that they couldn’t allow it. I am a non confrontational person, but I do worry I didn’t fight enough to make sure my mother could stay and help her overnight. Do we have a right to stay with her and assist her and make the medical decisions I’m sure will be needed overnight? Or does the hospital’s policy trump our Letter of Conservatorship? This is in California. \n","answer":" You should contact the patient advocate or the social worker at the hospital to walk you through precisely what your rights are, and they may also help you navigate what's best for your sister. Answer #2: They may not allow you to stay, but your Dr should be able to write an order for a sitter. That would be for a hospital employee to stay with the patient all night and alert the nurses if something is wrong. "}
{"question":"This was my first apartment, I alone can afford the apartment, he makes half as much as I do. We broke up and forced me out, but now he is saying that he will not sign me off the lease. \n\nMainly because if he tanks the place or can't make rent he wants the repercussions to fall on me as well. I have already contacted the landlord and told her about my situation. He is supposedly moving his friend in, but did not tell the landlord (I did).\n\nHe also is trying to keep my cat. I have insurance on him, but that is all the paper work I have showing ownership (he is a rescue\/was a stray). I am really stressed out, and don't know what to do. I am living with my aunt until I can get back on my feet, and I have no idea what to do about this.\n\nI am in NE Ohio, USA\n","answer":" You have this all wrong.\n\nThe lease is between both of you (co-tenants) and the landlord.  You have already broken the lease by moving out (never mind the valid circumstances).  Do not confuse being in an abusive situation with having a legal contract with another party automatically broken.  Thing's don't work that way. \n\nYour landlord has the ability to remove you from the lease, NOT your ex-boyfriend.\n\nAs long as you are on the lease, yes, you can be sued for the rent by either your landlord or your ex. \n\nYou can't be evicted by a co-tenant.  I think leaving an abusive person was smart, but in the USA, you can't be evicted without a court order.  \n\nAsk your landlord for an amendment to your original lease, releasing you from the lease.  They may or may not want to do this because having you on the lease makes you financially responsible for the term of the lease.  \n\n\"Telling\" people does nothing.  What is signed on the dotted line or is in writing is what counts.Answer #2: He is not required to sign you off. Your landlord would likely not allow it anyway if he makes so much less. \n\nBut if you have proof that you were *forced* out and not just that you left due to the relationship ending, you might have a defense in court if he sues you. You would also want to get proof of his friend moving in. Both those things could keep you from having to pay anything. "}
{"question":"I work fast food. I rung up some ice cream that we sell and got a cup of root beer for free (which they allow us to do) and mixed them together to make a root beer float because it’s about 50¢ cheaper than ringing it up normally and I get more ice cream.\n\nMy manager saw this and told me that I was stealing by not ringing it up as a root beer float. My argument is that I paid for the ice cream and they allow us to have drinks for free so it’d be the same as if I went into a grocery store that sold sandwiches and bought some bread and condiments and just made a sandwich from those because it costs less.\n\nWho’s in the wrong in this situation?\nTopic:\nCriminal Law\n","answer":" Boss is wrong.

I'm sure that it doesn't work like that, since most apartments with a \"no pets\" policy have them for a reason. \n\nSo could we get in anywhere? Also, would my SO be part of a protected class since she has the dog because of a mental disability?\n\nAsking mostly out of curiosity.\n","answer":" Under HUD guidelines her dog is protected by the fair housing act, however it sounds like it is not a service dog as defined by the ADA.\n\nFHA does not apply in all circumstances,such as, if you are renting a private home directly from the owner (not listed by a real estate agent) or if you art renting a room in someone's home, or if you are renting a unit in a 4 unit or smaller building and the owner lives in one of the units.\n\nThe FHA also does not apply to motels or other public accommodations "}
{"question":"So my car was rear ended and the trunk door was pretty messed up. It still closes and the damage is purely cosmetic, and drives as it always has. It's an old vehicle, however, and the repair costs bumped it over into the total loss category. \n\nI understand I need to apply for a salvage title and then rebuild title to keep driving it legally, but the DC DMV website says I must apply for a salvage title within 30 days.

Thank you.\n","answer":" Disappearing is not, in and of itself, a sign your kid is in danger.

{"question":"In Jan 2013 we were halfway through a pregnancy and my wifes parents health insurance company, Blue Shield, switched from california to texas.

We couldn't apply for a new health insurance because once again pre-exisiting condition.

In addition, exclusions cannot apply to a newborn, an adopted child under age 18, or a child under age 18 placed with a family or individual for adoption, as long as the child became covered under creditable coverage within 30 days of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption and does not incur a subsequent 63-day break in coverage.\n\nSo in theory this does not sound kosher to me, but it sounds like there could also be more to the story than is apparent here. For starters, it's not really accurate to characterize what happened as a \"drop\" since it sounds like the plan was actually switched, rather than terminated.\n\nFor purposes of pre-existing conditions that shouldn't make a difference since we're talking about pregnancy, but it simply makes me question whether there is actually a different issue. For example, if she met her deductible on the previous insurance but has now changed plans, perhaps her maternity coverage is not yet kicking in. But that would be a deductible issue, not a pre-existing condition issue."}

He's been known to take off work because of his stomach problem, which was fine in the past. He went to the lake on the 4th with his family and returned to work today (the 5th), and his boss confronted him saying he had someone with pictures of him and his family at the lake; he was asking why was he there when he took a day off for being sick. I know there's laws for privacy in Georgia, but I'm not sure if that was breaking any due to it being a public area. \n","answer":" It’s not illegal to take pictures in public.

{"question":"I live in a complex with about 15 or so buildings (8 people per building), and we have cops that sit there every day in the visitor parking. We are not too loud, don't throw block parties or make any sort of big messes. Still, we have these cops out every weekend. At the beginning of the semester (each semester) there are about 4 out every Friday and Saturday night. One has a dog that patrols the area. I was playing basketball on our court at 11:00 pm on a Friday night and a cop drove by and told us that the court was closed (at 10:00), but there is no sign saying that. We had a cop come up to our upstairs neighbors and told them they were being too loud. (2 girls drinking, while we, 4 guys, were down stairs playing music and screaming while playing Fifa).

When someone calls and complains that you're being too loud.\n\nNothing you wrote makes me think the officers are acting improperly.  Talk to your apartment complex- it's likely that they are requesting the presence. Answer #2: The police are there likely because of a lot of complaints coming from other residents. Yes, the complex can allow the police to enforce the law.\nFrankly you sound like you are in a college apartment building and I have a feeling that your idea of being quiet and neighborly doesn't line up with most of societies idea.\n\n\nPlaying basketball at 11pm would drive me insane. that's not a quiet sport.

He might also try animal control in that area. If all else fails he will have to go to court.Answer #2: Did D get the dog  microchipped? It is notoriously hard to get the police to return a stolen pet. If the dog was some sort of expensive bread with paperwork D may be able to sue Cindy for the cost of a replacement (or best case scenario scare Cindy into giving the dog back).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than that, if D can somehow get possession of the dog back, the police would likely not return the dog to Cindy.

For myself, if some kid was arrested for misdemeanor possession and had no criminal history or other aggravating factors, I'd be pretty inclined to not recommend jail time.  I would probably entertain the idea of some probation time and maybe community service.  \n\nHUGE DISCLAIMER: that is just applicable to me and my jurisdiction.  I assume this is a city of Columbia case, and I can't speak at all for their prosecutor's position on marijuana possession.  Each jurisdiction and prosecutor have their own quirks.  That is why you should contact a defense attorney in Columbia. They are going to know how to deal with the prosecutor and what a typical punishment is.  \n\nKeep in mind that anything within the maximum sentence could happen- unlikely, but still possible.  This is serious enough that you'll need to get your parents involved.  Someone else down the thread recommended going to court and just being honest.  Please don't do this.  At that point you are just putting yourself at the mercy of the court.  In some extreme cases, you'll get a sympathetic prosecutor and judge, but I would never advise anyone to take that risk without some knowledge of how that jurisdiction generally operates."}

Is there anything beneficial that would result in an outcome to this scenario other than being given a break and workplace ostracization? \n","answer":" You need to ask for your break or take it. There is clearly a policy in place that allows you to take it. You need to be proactive. It's not their fault if they told you to take a break and you didn't. "}

{"question":"My girlfriend just got back home from buying a kitten off of her friends coworker. Apparently coworker has cat alergies and her and her boyfriend agreed they wanted to get rid of the cat.

What happens if she refuses to give it back? She's worried about them taking legal action but I figured it's a sale, she paid, and there's conversation between them beforehand where they talk about making the deal. We're in Orlando, Florida.\n","answer":" Does she have a receipt? Are there texts from the former owner saying something to the effect of having changed her mind?Answer #2: I dont think this is so much a legal issue as it is a \"dont be a jerk\" issue.  She should be the better person and give the kitten back.  As its been said, she only had the cat for an hour, versus the bond the coworker obviously made.  If it means that much to the coworker to have the kitten, just be kind and do it.  Sure, its annoying and yes its inconvenient, but there are other kittens.  Plenty of shelter cats would love a person to own."}
{"question":"So I'm a summer intern at Columbus, OH and I came from Turkey for just this summer ( with J1 visa ). I found this place on craigslist and we signed a lease.

My wife was brought to the United States illegally when she was two years old, and we were beginning the process of trying to get her a green card when we hit a brick wall.  \n\nEvidently you cannot even apply for one if you came to the country illegally, and the Immigration Services office is telling us that she is going to have to return to Mexico and apply for a Visa there.

{"question":"I have been recently thinking about moving to Pennsylvania with my fiancé l,9year old son, and 3 month old baby. My 9 year old son is not my fiancé real son but he cares for him like his own. I currently live in Florida and 9 year old son occasionally  visits his father. When I say occasionally I mean once every blue moon. I have already brought up that I want to move but he wasn’t having it and was like “yeah I don’t think that is going to work and that I can’t do it.” I need some serious advice on what to do because I want to leave Florida by next year.\n","answer":" Well sorry to disappoint you but this likely won't happen as quick and as simple as you want it to happen.\n\nHere's the problem. You currently probably have a court order regarding visitation and it's highly unlikely if it would say that you are allowed to move outside of the jurisdiction that it was established in without your son's father's permission.\n\nIf you don't have an court order or if you move even without a court order that doesn't say anything then he would have some time to take you to court and the court would pretty much force the return of your son to Florida. \n\nSo right now it's time to talk to a family law attorney in your state to petition the courts to set up a parrenting plan allowing you to move to Pennsylvania with your son (and you would have to show that it's in your son's best interest to move to Pennsylvania). If the courts say that he can't be taken out of the jurisdiction then that move won't happen (or you would have to leave your son behind)."}

{"question":"I live in California and my friends bf has been arrested and has a bail of $25,000 what are his options since he doesn’t have the money. Can he pay in small payments? What does a bail bondsman do? Does he need a lawyer? Also what are a minors options to not be at home. What does it take to get emancipated?\n","answer":" Jesus, one thing at a time.  \n\n\nBail is an amount of money used by courts to guarantee a person will show up for a court date.  Most of the time you hire a bail bondsman, and they will charge you 10% the cost of your bond to bail you out.  However if you have the full amount you can make your own bail.  However it sounds like you don’t, you’ll just have to call and see what bail bondsmen are willing to do for payments, some might want a down payment, some might not, some might not want your business at all.  \n\n\nSo basically you’re looking at $2500, maybe they’ll let you make payments, maybe not.  However, your friend doesn’t have to make bail and can stay in jail if you don’t have the funds."}

{"question":"After signing up for a driving school , the instructor announced that they would be holding onto our phones during the class. We were not informed of this before signing up for the class.

We are later dismissed in groups, and we can grab our phone from the box on our way out of the building.

Anything wrong with me just selling these ladies some Sigmas that I cut out of special cloth and serged for them? \n\nIs it legal to sell a Greek organization letters since it's \"just letters?\" so long as I sell them individual letters and not any particular combination (even if they pick out a certain 2-3 letters)? \n\n*Edited a little to condense. \n","answer":" You can't put them on a product to sell, so just customizing some letters for her is perfectly fine.

She dated a lieutenant on the force.\n\nDon't persist in this sort of conspiracy theory talk because it's a non-starter.  If the hospital (doctor) felt that she wasn't an immediate danger to herself or others, then they had to let her go.  The police won't sit around your house waiting for her to maybe show up.  If she comes over and is causing a problem, then you can call the police.  If you think that she is a danger to herself or others, then you can try to get her committed for a psych evaluation.

{"question":"I recently bought my dream car (Dodge viper ACR) and for those of you who aren't car people, it has an 8.4l V10. Today, the president of my HOA says I have to sell my car because of an archaic law in the HOA that states that vehicles with engines having more than 6 cylinders are not allowed. \n\nApparently, years ago the HOA had trouble with \"street racing\" and thus the law was put into place.

Answer #6: I had to go to jury duty yesterday. 5 people out of the 50 that were scheduled didn't show. If you still live in the same county that you got summoned in just call and explain. If you did nothing I think you would be safe too. That is why they bring in 50 and only select 13. Answer #7: Do not ignore this.

Is there a statute somewhere that states the maximum depth I can dig or the maximum volume of sand I can move before I'm performing construction and not just playing in the sand?\n","answer":" This has got to be the best question asked on this subreddit, ever. \n\nI'm both highly amused and in desperate need of an answer. Answer #2: Let's say you didn't use a bobcat, but an army of kids instead. Because I'm sure a line would be drawn somewhere before a bobcat.Answer #3: It definitely depends upon the location, but I don’t think in most places digging requires a permit. Even the “Call before you dig” thing isn’t a requirement, just a really, really good idea. As soon as you put in a “structure” you’d start to need a permit. \n\nThere’s also “sand dune” and bird\/turtle habitat considerations which might make digging (of any sort) illegal. \n\nEvery year, I hear of at least 1 person who ends up injured or dead because they were digging a hole and it collapsed on them, so the practical limit is knee-height. Answer #4: In panama city beach metal shovels are outlawed and holes can’t be deeper than 2 feet. It’s one of the laws the implemented after the 2015 spring break thing there. \n\nhttps:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/simpleview\/image\/upload\/v1\/clients\/panamacitybeach\/PCBPD_RackCard_v1_1_9319acf1-9d57-4e18-9cff-3efb04335767.pdfAnswer #5: Is it your beach, or a public beach?  \nIn the tidelands?  \nAbove the ordinary high water mark?  \nAbove the Extreme high water mark?\n\nIn my state, most beaches have prohibitions against motor vehicles, so the bobcat would be out. Some beaches are considered state highways, so you could legally drive the bobcat onto the beach, but digging COULD be considered illegal, since you are fucking with a highway.\n\nI think we need a professional in sand-law.Answer #6: My beach prohibits motorized vehicles, so you'd have to ditch the bobcat\/bulldozer. That's true of most beaches in my state (Florida). \n\nI'm not having much luck figuring out when you'd have to stop manually digging\/landscaping, though."}
{"question":"Exactly as the title says, professor caught best friend and I cheating on the exam. Basically, we made a code and were tapping and writing numbers on each other’s thighs. We didn’t think she would notice (obviously) but she did and we immediately failed the exam and she told us both to come in and talk to the head of department. I told her that we didn’t cheat and we were just touching each other’s legs. Also, I switched exams (they had both A &amp; B) to have the same exam as my friend, sitting next to me. \n\nHELP? What do you think will happen? Will I be able to get my actual grade for the exam or will I be stuck with a zero? \n","answer":" He didn't catch I. He caught me. He caught my best friend and me cheating on an exam.\n\nYou're likely to get zero on the exam. Be happy you weren't kicked out of the course. \n\nWhat's your legal question?Answer #2: Probably fail the exam, and, worst-case scenario, face expulsion, or at the least, some kind of disciplinary action.\n\nThis isn't a legal issue.  You're at the mercy of your school.\n\nNon-legal, life advice: you're pissing money away by cheating; even worse if it's your parents' money.  If you don't want an education, drop out and save yourself or your parents that money.  If you do want an education, learn the shit and do it yourself.Answer #3: You cheated. You were caught. This happened in a university, you have no legal remedy. The university has a vested interest in having and enforcing academic integrity policies, and in the course of doing this you were legitimately caught cheating on an exam. \n\nYou could easily be expelled. You can do nothing but beg.Answer #4: If you're lucky, you'll just fail the class.\n\nIf you're not, you'll get expelled. \n\nMost school have policies on how to handle cheating, detailed in student handbooks or similar resources. I advise you to familiarize yourself with your school's cheating policy."}

{"question":"Hello everyone.  My parents currently live in GA, and I tend to cover their HOA fees, as they're having a tough time covering more than the mortgage + util.  \n\nI recently found out that the HOA fees went up $50 a month, for 6 months, for a \"special assessment fee.\"  I inquired what this was for, and I was told that a homeowner had brought against them and the developer a lawsuit for a pond, and to cover the lawyer fees, the homeowners have to cough up $300 extra.\n\nIs this legal?  I don't even have the by-laws on me, so I have no idea if they're allowed to do this.  It seems sketchy to me.\n","answer":" Yup.  This is what happens when an HOA ends up in litigation -- the members pay for it.  $300 is nothing.  They should be happy it's not thousands.Answer #2: Legal and typical.  \"Special Assessments\" are for things that the HOA can not easily predict and budget for, such as legal fees, lawsuit payouts, unforeseen repairs to community structures (more typical in condos I think), and so on.  A lawsuit payouts is something that you should be seriously worried if they start budgeting for."}

{"question":"Sorry if this doesn't fit well in this sub, but I figured it's worth a shot. I just heard on the news that Swift plans to rerecord her last 6 albums so she can have control over them. Would that not fall under any form of copyright laws protecting the original recordings? I'm not really a big Swift fan, however that headline really caught my ear for the legal reason.\n","answer":" You might be interested in the US Copyright Office's circular on musical copyrights, [here](https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/circs\/circ56a.pdf).\n\nIn short, there are generally two different rights at play with music. First, you have the copyright over the composition -- the lyrics and sheet music, for instance. Then you have the copyright over the recording -- the actual master tapes of a particular performance of the composition.\n\nIn this case, presumably the record company owns the copyright to the recordings, but the artist (or at least someone other than the record company) owns the copyright to the compositions. If that's right, then the artist is free to record another performance of the same songs, which might end with her owning the copyright to those new performances.\n\nAll of that is likely spelled out in contracts between the parties (the artist, the composer, the record company, the recording studio, etc.), but given my understanding of entertainment law, it's probably not **clearly** spelled out, so there may well be fights between the parties both in public and in the courtroom.Answer #2: Depends whether she owns the copyright on her compositions, or signed it away to a publisher.\n\nThe copyright on the \"phonorecord\" (original recordings) is irrelevant.Answer #3: Yes, if not she wouldn’t be so sure about doing it.\n\nShe wrote every single one of those songs, which means she owns the copyright. She also said according to her old contract, she’ll be able to re record her old albums starting this November."}

For christ's sake they use old hamburger containers from Walmart for holding the parts we use every day. \n\nBasically, there are presses at my work that take an aluminum or copper tube and flatten one end of it, punch holes in it, and then send it on its way to be washed. It the flattening process, a large amount of oil is needed (we still haven't been told why) and when it gets washed off, the water and oil goes into a basin in the floor. When about 100 gallons of water and oil is collected, it gets pumped into the municipal wastewater  lines and sent out. \n\n\nI'd be extremely surprised if the ground around the building isn't completely contaminated, but when I bring it up, management shuts me down. \n","answer":" If any of that water goes to ocean, lake or river, call Dept.

{"question":"My girlfriend has told me that her employers are going to give her and her coworkers a test to see if they know the job well enough (she works in food service). They say if she or any others don't get 95% or more on this test they will take them out of the tip pool (they pool all the tips together and redistribute them) so any tips she would have gotten would go to others. \n\nDoes this sound legal (we are in California)?

{"question":"My dad owns a property where one of the tenant (2nd Floor) decided to put up a HUGE above ground pool.

I know in the contact we said we will pay for the water, but filling up a 6,000 gallon pool and paying for it is kinda absurd... \n\nThanks in advance - goldmakesmehappy\n","answer":" There are most likely going to be a lot of code problems here and even though the lease doesnt say anything about pools. Doesnt mean they can just build one. For one, with your dad he is now most likely going to have to update his insurance policy to include this new pool. Not to mention the cost to reseed or resode the lawn once it is removed. I would give them a notice to cure (remove the pool). If they do not then evict them and use their security deposit for any costs to remove the pool. There may be nothing about pools in the lease, but the tenant cannot modify a property like this at all.Answer #2: This is a major change to the property, and presents a lot of code and insurance issues. You can certainly demand removal.\n\nIn your lease, do you have any verbiage about billing them for excesses or overages in utility costs?Answer #3: It would be a wise idea for your father to be extremely specific about draining that pool as well.  If not done properly it can damage the home, the yard and possibly adjacent properties.Answer #4: You might be able to ask them to remove it if they don't meet the municipality fence requirements for a pool. You would have to look into that. If you have damages arising from the pool you can sue them or try to go to small claims if it is under the limit. Pool pops and damages the lawn, the building, etc. \n\nIf your lease says you pay for water, you pay for water.\n\nStamford appears to have an online process for applying for a pool, so you can look through the city government for help."}

{"question":"Edit: I probably should have updated shortly after I posted, but I can fully admit that I'm acting like an entitled cow about this. I'm not going to pursue anything and I'm grateful for people being blunt and honest with me.\n\nThank you guys, I appreciate it\n","answer":" If the mere existance of a NICU was enough to cause emotional distress, then they wouldn't exist in the first place. You have no damages, and deserve no compensation other than the unnecessary bills. The fact that the patient was a newborn doesn't mean the misdiagnosis is more damaging. Misdiagnosis is extremely common and not malpractice.Answer #2: You have no damages.  They paid for the expenses of the second hospital. And they escalated in order to make sure your done was treated in a hospital that was better equipped to do the procedure.\n\nYou could pursue it. I honestly doubt you'd be successful.Answer #3: Medical malpractice is extremely fact specific and you need to talk to a lawyer who handles malpractice. That being said, it seems like they absolutely are offering compensation. They are offering to pay all costs associated with the other hospital. It doesn't seem like you have damages here that the other hospital isn't covering. Talk to a med malpractice lawyer to know for sure. "}
{"question":"So i found a webm on 4chan of a video, tryed searching for it if it was on YT already and didnt find anything, i uploaded it to my youtube and monetized it. It got viral within 1 week and got over a million views.\n\nThen i got some people commenting on it that it was fake and stolen and linking to the original (not sure if that one is the original but it was uploaded like 3 months prior). \n\nSo should i just delete the video now? Or what do i do? Do i return the money that i get from youtube somehow? Essentialy i just dont want to face some lawsuit over this.\n","answer":" You do not hold the copyright to the video so by you uploading a copy of it yourself and making money off it you have left yourself open to alot of issues.\n\nIt's also against Youtubes conditions of use which could end up getting your account banned.\n\nReturn the money (If possible?).

{"question":"Father had paid child support for a few years ( maybe 2 ) then moved to another state and stopped paying for the next 16 years. He has two children with my mother, my brother and I. That is why the amount owed is so high. He moved back to Arizona a few years back (The state where all of us live)  Is there anything legally my mother can do about this? We also don't want thousands of dollars in legal fees. He also is a bit of a maniac and I'm worried for my mothers safety if  any legal action was taken against him. Any advice? Again we are in the state of AZ.\n","answer":" You can start by contacting https:\/\/des.az.gov\/services\/child-and-family\/arizona-child-support-services Arizona child support services. If the order for child support was made in the state, then presumably they have a record of it and I am willing to bet would very much like to talk to him.Answer #2: The same thing happened with my dad. He owed my mom 80k in back-pay. We are now 24,22 &amp; 19 and the State took my dad to court when he finally got a real job and now garnish his paycheck. Just know your dad will not get away with this. It will bite him in the ass some day. I would follow the advice you were given, try to alert the right state institution and hope for the best. Him moving out of state did not prevent him from having to pay. They will find him.Answer #3: Ianal but have dealt with child support for my daughter.\n\nThe backpay doesn't go away.  Your mom needs to contact the child support agency and push for action to be taken.  They will follow up!  \n\nDepending on state law he could:\nHave wages garnished if he's working and\/or collect tax returns if he files.\nDriver's license revoked \nJail\n\nUsually when I have had to contact them about next measures if he isn't going to pay it isn't too long before payments resume.

{"question":"So my other post is on here but I'll cut to the chase now. My ex has a RO against me and I found a video on my google drive that was connected to my old phone of her sexually assaulting and raping me in my sleep. I called the police and they are having an officer call me back. She took the footage on my phone while i was asleep. I can't get in trouble for having this footage can I? Should I not report? Please help. The officer should be calling me any minute.  \n","answer":" You're not going to get in trouble. The video was recorded with your personal property and stored on your Google drive. Answer #2: No, you won't get in trouble for having that recording and reporting it. I also read your other post and my other piece of advice is to not miss another court date without warning,  because it really doesn't look good for you. Actually, try not to miss one in general, but if you're once again struck ill on the day of your hearing, its probably smart to go to the doctor and get a note from a professional.

{"question":"So my daughter snuck out of the house the other night and was picked up my an 18 year old male whom we have not allowed to date. It was not a \"we forbid you\" situation. We just simply did not know. She says he asked to come by and she said no. Eventually he convinced her, picked her up and took her to a nearby parking lot. She says they were there for about 30 minutes. She says all they did was talk but I choose to take that with a grain of salt. My question is, do I have any legal recourse? Kidnapping, enticing a minor, custodial interference....anything? And could I potentially get a restraining order? \n","answer":" Your recourse is limited; the closest charge I can recall is Enticing a Minor, which is a class B misdemeanor in Texas. It is doubtful any type of felony was committed (such as kidnapping). And assuming sexual activity between the two of them occured, this would likely not be statutory rape. Although the age of consent in Texas is 17, there's a three year \"Romeo and Juliet\" exception that your daughter and her friend fall within.\n\nWhether or not he can be charged, and the chances of a restraining order surviving the initial hearing, are questions that can be answered by filing a report with your local police department.Answer #2: You can speak to the police, and they may look into it further, and charge him with statutory rape. It would be near impossible to get a restraining order, it's your job to ensure your daughter doesn't leave the house. No kidnapping, custodial interference, etc. Really all you have is a claim for potential statutory rape.  "}

{"question":"My rental agency forgot to put the end lease date in our lease at signing and needs us to re-sign acknowledging the date of the lease termination.

It languished for several months, and eventually the money got returned to me.

There were circumstances back then that made this super illegal (I was 17) that are no longer applicable to me. At that time, I didn't do anything about the situation because 1) I didn't know what to do and 2) I never saw the video but I'm sure it exists\/existed because I saw the \"hidden\" camera set up and thought \"That's a strange way to store a camera.\" Anyway, I've been trying to get back into the dating pool but it's been kind of difficult because I'm scared this will happen again.

You can be clear and honest with the person that you do not consent to be filmed, before you have any sexual contact with them. I mean, if you really wanted, you could get it in writing. Going further, you could always avoid sexual activities until you absolutely trust a person. But I digress and this is getting beyond legal advice. There's not much more you can do from a legal standpoint to avoid this.Answer #2: Not a lawyer but...\n\nI would call the cops. Probably the RI cops since that's where this happened. I'm going to assume you're not the first person he's done this to. If you don't report him, there will probably be more victims to come. It doesn't matter that you're not 17 anymore, he's still committing a serious crime just by possessing that video.

{"question":"Are there limits?\n\nWe're assuming the person being attacked is a celebrity and has reason to lose a lot of money in a civil court.\n","answer":" Let's say I punch you. You can punch back to the extent it is reasonable to defend yourself. At a certain point of you punching back, I may cease to be a threat. If you keep punching after that point, you are no longer defending yourself and are liable for the damage you cause. Of course, it will almost always be factually murky, regarding when you should have stopped punching. "}
{"question":"I myself am not from the USA, but the corporation in question is from America. It´s HQ is in Washington (the state). I have acquired a lawyer in my home country and i´m sure he wouldn't want me to disclose any information about the case here. **I´m just curious about how copyright infringement laws in america work and the procedure for a case like this ?**\n","answer":" This is a copyright infringement.  You can sue them for the amount of profit they made from the infringement and for the amount of money you lost.  If you registered the copyright with the US Copyright Office (such as at copyright.gov) within the proper window, then you can sue them for statutory damages, so you don't have to prove they made any profits off the infringement, nor that you lost any.\n\nYou would sue them in US federal court for copyright infringement.  You need an attorney in the US for a US lawsuit.\n\n"}

{"question":"So there is this guy that gave me chlamydia and didn’t even care that he did. He called me stupid and all sorts of names when I called him out.\n\nEveryone told me to report him to my university health center for spreading STDS and not even caring. \n\nJust my fear is that he will release my nudes. I sent them to him on Snapchat and he later on saved them to camera roll. I asked him why and he said to show him to a friend to join in a threesome  (he wanted to double team with me). He then said the videos got deleted but I do not believe him \n\nI fear that once I complain to school health center, he is going to release my nudes somewhere saying my full name even tho it’s unidentifiable that it’s me \n\nIssue is Snapchat convos gets erased so there is no proof that he has my videos. So Idk if the police would even do anything if there is lack of evidence\n","answer":" The police cannot do anything about something you are afraid might happen but for which you have nothing but a feeling about. If you had anything, a threat to release them, literally anything, you might be able to get a protective order. As it is you have nothing but your feeling.  VA does have a revenge porn law so if he does actually spread them with the intent to “coerce, harass, or intimidate” you, then it would be criminal and you can report that."}
{"question":"Last night I was in a small college town called Athens. I was in a group with about five people in a circle. A cop rolled up and said he smelled marijuana. He searched everyone and didn't find anything. He searched the ground and found a bag of weed. He charged all of us with possession but I didn't even have any on me. I was just there when it was all taken place\n\nHe said I could go plead guilty and go through a diversion program and get let off pretty easy. But I don't want to plead guilty because I'm not. \n\nI need to know a few things:\n1) can he charge us all with possession without finding it on all of us?\n\n2) if he can , should I just plead guilty and pay the fine and do the diversion program to get it off my record.\n\n3) OR should\/can I fight it if I had NOTHING on me but still got charged for a bag on the ground that wasn't mine? \n","answer":" 1) Yes\n\n2) No one can advise you about this without knowing the particulars of your case. You should speak with a lawyer. A drug conviction (which might include a guilty plea) could have very serious consequences such as you losing your ability to apply for or receive student loans or scholarships. \n\n3) See #2Answer #2: Others have mentioned constructive possession but haven't defined it for you, so you may still be confused. The idea is that if you had the ability to exercise dominion and control over the drugs, then the court will \"construe\" that as possession. This is \"constructive\" possession. And it's a common method to charge possession crimes when there isn't actual possession.\n\nBut a lawyer is the best option for you. You may have a case, but we can't judge that for you. Answer #3: Since you didn't provide a location, I'm going to assume you're referring to the one in GA that hosts UGA.\n\n2 - Don't listen to police for legal advice: they don't necessarily have your best interests in mind. What he said may be true, but you should really talk to a lawyer. \n\nAlso, as \/u\/iamequipoised noted: student loans can be affected by a drug conviction. See the FAFSA site, [here](https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/eligibility\/criminal-convictions#drug-convictions). Short version, you're not totally screwed, but you still don't want that to be on your record."}

He said he wanted to sue them for screwing him up, and now he's gone I want to as well. I don't feel justified and these pricks basically killed him by not hitting the right place with the radiation.\n\nI am a minor, so what would my stance be? Would I even have a chance of suing them? I can try and provide medical evidence and reports from our family doctor and the hospital he was in when he died.\n","answer":" this is beyond the scope of this sub, you need to have your mom, or your dad's next of kin that's an adult speak with a malpractice attorneyAnswer #2: To successfully sue, you would have to prove that the doctors were negligent with your father's care. \n\nHow do you know they were irradiating the wrong area? Was that disclosed to your father? Or are you assuming because the tumor got larger? For a tumor to grow that much, it was likely a very aggressive cancer. Were they doing other treatments?\n\nYou could find med malpractice lawyers and see if your mom would follow up with them?"}
{"question":"I originally paid 306 for PT classes in November, however I didn't end up using them. At first I was fine with just transferring them over to my father but they didn't allow that, so one of the guys sat me down and told me to write and sign a cancellation notice, which I did. \n\nHowever after checking my cc bank statements I have noticed recurring payments of 196 since January ( I cancelled on December.) \nWhat should I do?

That'll ensure you don't get a ticket for  entering a licensed premise underaged.Answer #2: If there is a law there about being in a bar underage, then yes.\n\nIf he thinks you are possibly underage *and* has reason to suspect you ~~are intoxicated~~ have been drinking, then yes.\n\nIf he has reason to believe that you broke some other law, then yes."}

I thanked him and we parted way. A few hours later the property owner contacted my friend and said that he looked into the anvils value and had changed his mind.

{"question":"if the defense lawyer bring that information to court, will the defense lawyer be subject to disciplinary actions?\n","answer":" It depends on the state... Generally, an attorney cannot disclose client communications (even confessions)... \n\nIn some states, there are exceptions to this rule, with the big one being if there is the potential to obviate future serious injury (or death).  (Some states also allow disclosure of future crimes.)\n\nYou haven't said that was the case here... so, to answer your question... generally, I would expect the attorney would be subject to disciplinary action and or sanction, and may end up with a civil action against him for malpractice.\n\nNOTE however, that an attorney also cannot knowingly allow his client to lie at court... so if you confess, and during testimony are asked if you \"did it\"... and you lie... the attorney would be placed in a very difficult position.  If this happens, I believe the attorney has a duty to request to withdraw from representing you.  While I don't believe he can specifically say why, it is very likely that the Court will come to understand that the attorney believes you are lying on the stand."}
{"question":"The only people who are supposed to have access to this garage are tenants\/residents, since you either need a remote that opens the garage gate (which is given only to residents who pay for parking), or you need to enter through the building (which requires a key). \n\nI've already filed a police report, and am in the process of making a claim with my renter's insurance. The value of the objects taken is easily over $1,000. However, it seems the property is taking no responsibility for the security of the garage, and did not even seem at all interested in documenting this event.

I'm wondering if since it costs a dollar everytime you run it and I'm in an income based apartment if there's anything I can do to make my landlord replace it. It's only a dollar everytime but over time that's gonna end up being around an extra 100 bucks a year just for laundry and since I'm in an income based apartment that seems pretty crazy. I briefly mentioned it to her a while back and she just said that it sucks but thats how it is. Thinking that maybe I could bring up that just my building alone should be able to afford a new dryer with all the extra we've been paying and I bet the other buildings are the same.\n","answer":" Unless your lease specifies that you only need to run your clothes through once to dry, you're unlikely to get anywhere. They could raise the cost to $2 per cycle if they get a new one (aiming cost per cycle is not mentioned in the lease). \n\nPut fewer clothes in maybe? You can always hang things up to dry in your place, and it may cut the cost. Answer #2: Does your lease promise you laundry?"}

My lawyer will of course give me her own advice but I'd love to hear of any experiences you've had with this. Anything that's worked well for your clients and pitfalls to avoid. \n\nThank you!\n","answer":" Dress in whatever makes you feel strongest. I’d suggest a pant suit or dressy pants and a classy, comfortable sweater.\n\nI would recommend not taking your Ativan. You want to be as mentally sharp as possible, especially when his attorney is questioning you. \n\nGood luck and I admire you for doing this.Answer #2: I recently had to testify at a hearing. Two things were helpful:\n\nOur lawyer sent me questions ahead of time and I wrote down my answers. In the moment, it was helpful to think about what I had written to maintain composure.\n\nWait a few seconds before answering the others sides’ questions to give your lawyer time to object, and time for you to gather yourself before answering. No need to rushAnswer #3: I went through this and I would say take a deep breathe and don’t let them rush you. Speak slowly and take your time. I would also have someone you trust to come sit in the court room for reassurance.  I also had a bucket on the stand just in case because when they wanted details I started to gag and needed to throw up.   It’s ok to cry and you are doing the right thing.

If I were to keep my containers of these in the trunk would it be considered an open container if pulled over? I read that any seal being broken counts as an open container but I could not find out if that was excluding if it was in the trunk\n","answer":" Generally speaking, you can transport alcohol in the trunk of a vehicle legally. Any opened container needs to be closed and put in a compartment in the vehicle the driver could not access while driving.

{"question":"A friend of mine who has pets is having a very difficult time finding a place to live that will allow her two dogs.

They're no longer pets if they're service animals.\n\nCan anyone tell me precisely what is wrong with this? I feel that it's wrong but I can't express why; I don't want to see her actually try to do this and getting any trouble.\n","answer":" Well service animals must be trained to do a specific task to assist with a disability.  ESAs must be “prescribed” by a doctor who is treating you for a disability (typically depression).  And both are subject to being reasonable, so you cannot just say I get multiple animals.  Yes, that’s terrible advice that is likely to get her evicted.Answer #2: Yes let's lie and take advantage of laws designed to protect the needs of disabled people."}

Tell your friend to stand by to have her life spun out of control by forces which very few people here can begin to understand.  His career is over, btw.  Once the accusation goes out, even if he transfers, the MC is small enough that reputations never truly disappear.  \n\n\nBtw, if you have any other friends who believe they're being raped, every military base in the continental U.S. has no less than three different places they can go to consult, for free, their options.

But before you consider going the legal route, it's possible that this is something they would consider changing if you just asked. Sometimes schools just use general block lists they download from somewhere without really giving the issue too much thought.Answer #2: Well then shouldn't they change it to block all religious websites, if they can block certain ones or call them a disruption or distracting, then why wouldn't they all be a problem? aren't they just promoting their so-called \"traditional religions\" over the others? \nthis is clearly a way of skirting around the fact that the school systems aren't \"allowed\" to promote religion in the classroom, but they get around it through subliminal acts like this. this is censorship of information and free thought, plain and simple.

Answer #2: BIG OL QUESTION HERE: if you are admitted into an inpatient center for said reason, do you really have zero gun rights?Answer #3: ~~So which state is this?~~ Nevermind, I missed that you said California. I worked as a director’s designee—someone empowered by the county mental health authority to put individuals on hold—and there are multiple steps involved in committing someone. Generally speaking a crisis responder—someone like me, an EMT trained in mental health, or a cop—puts an individual on a hold which enables that individual to be transported to an ER. An ER doc will then need to confirm that the hold is both valid and still necessary. This hold will last up to 72 hours. This can be extended if the individual requires further stabilization. If the person isn’t stable at the end of that period they may be transported to a state mental health facility. Before that happens the individual is again assessed by another mental health clinician (doc or similar) and a court gets involved. Different states will have somewhat difference processes but, in general, you can’t get committed without a number of people, specifically trained docs and a court, confirming that you are a danger to yourself or others. \n\nEdit: [Relevant legislation](https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&amp;sectionNum=5150)\n\nSo, the process I described is more or less how California handles involuntary treatment.

{"question":"So, long story short, I got myself ordained online through the Universal Life Church in order to officiate my brother's wedding (this was in 2012).  He got served with divorce papers last week, even though they had a plan in place to settle things via a mediator.  And she's basically gone nuts, trying to milk him dry.  After hearing everything she's trying to get out of him, I told him he should try to get a lawyer to challenge the validity of the marriage given that I'm not really a minister.  (I have also seen some articles online about how some of the marriages that were performed by \"ordained\" ministers from ULC have been challenged in courts and found to be invalid.)

{"question":"I'm interested in knowing some of the specifics for spousal obligation for student loans. I racked up substantial debt in undergrad and grad school to the tune of around 300k. I married my spouse right before grad school started. \n\nWe both decided to have children a few years ago, and that I would be the caretaker. I live in the state of Maryland, and will move to Ohio in a few years. From what I understand these states do not have shared debt laws, meaning my debts are mine and mine alone. Does the state where the loans were accrued matter or just the state of residency?\n\nSo, if I make no more income for the rest of my life, can I just not repay the loans? I know I have to keep my assets low, but how separate do a married couple's finances have to be so that one is not liable for the debt of the other? If a couple has separate banking and files taxes separately, are they protected? Or is that even necessary? Thanks!\n","answer":" Why did you borrow 300k not to have any income the rest of your life?  If these are private loans they can come after your life insurance some day when you die. You will also have absolutely abysmal credit which can harm you in ways you may not realize. Do you think this is setting a good example for your kids? What happens if your spouse dies or is hurt and can't work? Let's say your spouse dies and you get life insurance proceeds. The second it hits your bank account it can be levied. This is a very irresponsible plan for a number of reasons."}

Before we continue, you must affirm that you are not recording this call.\" At that point I realized they knew they were doing something dodgy.Answer #3: Sure. Businesses can refuse service for any non-discriminatory reason.Answer #4: I have personally told more than one person they weren't allowed to clearly take pictures of the set up and merchandise at a store I used to manage. It was a high end niche shop, so people would come to steal ideas and vendors.Answer #5: There are plenty of places, especially in design or art stores, that have signs of no pictures allowed.

{"question":"First time posting here and on my phone so I apologize ahead of time. We live in Kansas City Missouri if that helps\n\nMy brother has been working for a bakery for awhile now, and often works over 40hrs and gets OT. Recently they told him that he essentially has two jobs now working for two different \"companies\", same place, same things he's been doing, but now he's been informed he will receive two paychecks. This will mean no more OT for him, which obviously is a problem. Can they just tell him his job is now split? What can he do (other than obviously getting a less shady job)\n","answer":" Yeah, that doesn't fly.  Federal labor law says that \"employment by one employer is not completely disassociated from employment by the other employer(s), all of the employee's work for all of the joint employers during the workweek is considered as one employment for purposes of the Act.\"  So you can't split hours between two closely related companies to avoid paying OT.\n\nBasically, they're trying to run-around labor law, and it's illegal.  Contact your local department of labor and they should help you with this issue.Answer #2: They have actually said it will reduce\/eliminate OT??

He is now threatening to sue me under squatter's rights so he can stay longer.

I also have 3 other roomates. He's asking me for a 30 days notice note. Can he sue me?\n","answer":" \"Squatters' rights\" isn't a legal theory, and he won't get anywhere with that, but he _is_ your tenant, you _are_ his landlord, and you do have to give him 30 days' written notice to end his tenancy, not 27 days' verbal notice.\n\n\"Squatters' rights\" is a half-understood, poorly-remembered mish-mash of ideas, mixed up with the idea that tenants must be evicted in particular ways (which is true) and that an open and hostile occupant of a property can come to own that property (true in _very limited ways_, but the time frames involved are on the scale of years to decades, and it's irrelevant to your situation).Answer #2: He's asking for 30 days notice to move?\n\nThat's pretty reasonable, and is in fact what the law allows for evicting someone on a month to month verbal lease. \nHe has tenancy even if he's not paying rent."}

{"question":"(CA) I signed a lease for a studio apartment in November 2017, lasting for one year. The terms of the lease stipulate that dogs and cats are allowed for an extra price of 50\/month per animal. A week or so ago I adopted an adult golden retriever, and informed my landlord. She said great, you can pay me $600 next time you pay rent. I told her that since I just now got a dog, I should only have to pay for March-November 2018, not the previous months where I didn’t have a dog. She responded by saying that if I didn’t pay the full 600, I would be evicted. Is she in her right to do this, and should I just pay the full amount? Or am I correct in assuming I should only have to pay for the months I’ve had and will have a pet? Thanks in advance. \nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" If it specifies per month, it would be $50 from the month you got the dog. If it specifies just a flat $600 then your next rent you must pay an extra $600. If it specified $600 over the course of the lease, you would pay $600 divided by the remaining months per month extra.\n\nYou would almost certainly win in court if it is the former wording.

{"question":"I am trying to create a mobile app to sell college textbooks. Students will go to my app and choose school, choose specific class, and the app will show amazon affiliate link to buy a textbook that is required for that specific book. My legal question is, does the syllabus that professors provide to their students a public information, or is it copyrighted? Basically can the college\/university sue me since I am basically competing with their book stores? Do they have any legal grounds to do so?\n","answer":" You've got no legal issue, but I'm not sure what your app does that Chegg, Amazon, or school websites or local college bookstores don't already do. \n\nI mean, why would someone trust that your website is accurately giving them the books for their class? How would you collect all that information in a timely manner? Answer #2: It's legal to sell textbooks. Lots of places do. The syllabus is copyrighted (except possibly in the case of public universities), but copyright only prohibits you from copying it. It does not prohibit you from reading it and using the information in it. I.e., it is illegal for you to download the syllabus and host it on your own server. It is not illegal to have a listing on your website that says Professor X requires textbook Y, even if you gleaned this information from the syllabus."}
{"question":"So I went to court today for my unlawful detainer eviction and the landlord’s lawyer lied.\n\nThey said that I was screaming at my girlfriend “I’ll kill you bitch!” and that i went around to my neighbors threatening them.

{"question":"So I recently took up a night shift job a little over a month ago. During the process of filling out the paperwork for it, right towards the end they made me sign a paper saying that if I quit before 90 days I would be charged 300 dollars for the \"training.\" The training consisted of watching a 4 hour video from the 80's that was clearly outdated. I found that this job really isn't for me and spring quarter for college is coming up and I need to leave this job before I can go to school. My question is, if I quit the job after cashing my last paycheck and letting them know that I won't be showing up to work that day will they lawyer up and come after me? \n\nEdit: Just realized that due to how scheduling is, taking the money and running isn't even possible. Either way they can screw me out of 300 bucks.\nTopic:\nLabor Law\n","answer":" We can't say what they will or won't do.  However, clauses like this are very, very common, and will likely hold up if they do come after you."}
{"question":"I live in CA, USA. I have had a trust fund since birth set up to pay for my siblings and mine medical bills, school bills etc. Up until now they have had no problems. Recently, the person appointed to manage the fund i.e. cuts the checks, has had a condition where they have been unable to perform any of the managing duties. My family agrees the trust management has been unofficially taken over by the trust manager's daughter, whom has potentially been signing checks in the name of her parent. Since this change, the trust has failed to pay for some valid, necessary expenses (dental bills, tuition, medical) . They don't dispute that they should pay it, they just don't respond or continually say 'its coming.' They're pretty behind. I'm not sure if there is money to pay it in the trust or not. I have also been unable to obtain a copy of the charter, which my family has been trying to get for over a year.\n\nWhere do I start?\nTopic:\nWills Trusts and Estates\n","answer":" &gt;Where do I start?\n\nAn attorney of some sort sounds warranted here. Or some sort of fiduciary expert with knowledge of trustfund management.Answer #2: You need a copy of the trust. Usually there is a provision for a successor trustee in the event that the trustee is unable to serve. Answer #3: Allowing the daughter to operate in this capacity is untenable.  You need to figure out if the trust designates a successor trustee.  This is especially important since you mention writing checks in the trustee's name.  If you mean the daughter is forging their signature, this is fraud.Answer #4: you should be concerned that the daughter is looting the fundAnswer #5: Financial advisor here! First, as a beneficiary you are entitled to a copy of the trust agreement (the document that explains everything about the trust), which will include a section about primary trustees and contingent (secondary) trustees that should take over due to the primary's incapacity. It is unlikely (not impossible) that the trustee's daughter would take over those responsibilities, although there could be a provision for handing those responsibilities over to a qualified replacement. A few questions:\n\n1. Where is the trust held? When you get checks for expenses, what bank's name is on them?\n\n2. Can you give us a brief outline of the trust's formation? Ex: \"Upon my grandfather's death, an irrevocable trust was set up to pay for his grandchildren's education and medical expenses.\"\n\n3. What is the relationship between the grantor (creator of the trust) and the trustee (manager who pays it out).\n\n4. In what way is the successor trustee qualified to manage the trust? Are the father and daughter in business together as financial advisors\/lawyers\/etc. or is this just a friend of the family?"}

{"question":"Last year I purchased a residence in North Dakota. One of the features in the real estate listing was a 14x20 shop. I found out this year that the shop is not actually on the property I purchased, but is in fact just over the property line on a parcel owned by another individual who has no connection to this issue.\n\nDo I have any recourse to file against the previous owner to either pay to have the shop moved to the property I actually purchased from her (it's a permanent structure that will be a challenge to move), or to pay for the purchase of the parcel the shed is on?\n\nThank you for your time and any advice you can give.\n","answer":" Unfortunately, no. The listing is an advertisement asking for an offer. You (or the seller) likely provided a formal offer to purchase to the other which identified the property. The other party signed it, and then after a period of time, you proceeded with the closing. The offer to purchase likely had a legal description of the property or a tax parcel identification number. A title company probably provided you (the buyer) with a title insurance policy that had a full legal description of the property subject to the sale. The title insurance assures you that you are indeed getting good title, but only for the property described in the legal description.\n\nThe problem is likely that the legal descriptions of the property in the offer and the title insurance policy did not include the area where the structure resides. It would be very difficult to argue that the deal actually included the area where the shed resides due to the listing.\n\n(I am a real estate attorney in Wisconsin, but you should seek local counsel if you want legal advice.)"}
{"question":"Can they do anything?

A retired officer has no more pull than a regular citzenAnswer #2: A retired police officer has as much authority as a retired president, which is to say none.Answer #3: That retired officer is allowed under federal law to carry a concealed weapon in other states.\n\nBut he has no authority or arrest power at all beyond what you do.Answer #4: If this retired police officer is attempting to demand something &amp; claims he can arrest you just call the actual cops next time. The cops should be able to sort it out.Answer #5: You mention demands? I am no lawyer, but that seems like something on the less moral side of things, and might even be illegal depending on circumstancesAnswer #6: &gt;If I disagree his demands\n\nWhat demands?Answer #7: The only powers a retired California Police Officer has in Nevada, or California, are a federal carve-out for concealed-carry gun laws that cover most situations (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Law_Enforcement_Officers_Safety_Act) \n\nThe only reciprocity they have is also for gun-laws -- allowing them to do concealed carry in partner states where the LEOSA doesn't have a carve-out for that type of property.\n\nThere is a simple solution to fix this through: I would call your LOCAL police department's non-emergency line and tell them that a RETIRED Police Officer from California is claiming to have the power of an active Nevada Police Officer and what you should do if he starts giving \"lawful orders\".  My guess is that they will tell you to call 911 and report someone impersonating a police officer."}
{"question":"A person has a past wet and reckless conviction. Say this person goes out to have 3-4 drinks, ends up driving home and gets pulled over for suspicious driving. If BAC were to be borderline high, would it be smart in this persons case to refuse an immediate breathalyzer test and wait to get a test at the station so that BAC may drop below legal limit?\n","answer":" They can ascertain pretty easily what your BAC was at the time you were stopped. It's not like it's hard to calculate how quickly alcohol is removed from your system.\n\nYour question could also be rephrased as \"A person has a history of making poor decisions. If this continues, what are the odds that they're suddenly going to start making smart ones?\"\n\nA previous wet reckless is this person getting lucky. Continuing to push the boundaries means the book is going to get thrown at them the next time this winds up in front of a judge.Answer #2: If this person has had a previous dui, this person should not be drinking that much if they may need to drive home.\n\nThere is no good reason to roll the dice here. If you already have a DUI and are planning on maybe drinking and driving enough to get another you should consider whether you need treatment for alcoholism.\n\nOnly have 1-2 drinks if you may need to drive. The best legal advice is not to drink enough you would be potentially comitting a crime if you might need to drive home."}

{"question":"I am a creative\/graphic designer and I created my own little publication. The local entertainment tabloid (the kind many cities have outside restaurants\/coffee shops) did a article about my creation. It wasn't a review, it was just a little feature on it. \n\nOn the surface level the article reads fairly banal, but -between the lines- I am very cleverly put into a poor light. The article makes me sound like a rube frankly, but without overtly saying anything negative. \n\nI asked this tabloid to remove the article from their website because it comes up when my name is googled and they refuse. \nIs there anything I can do?\n","answer":" &gt;Is there anything I can do?\n\nNo, and to be honest that you would think you can do anything suggests you are slightly a rube when it comes to the publication business."}
{"question":"First time posting here, please let me know if I need to change anything.  \n\nHas anyone here dealt with a Nintendo charger that fried itself in the socket? My son was plugging it in and it popped the breaker and burned his hand, and my wife and I were wondering if we may have a case that we could bring against Nintendo if his hand gets worse. \nTopic:\nPersonal Injury\n","answer":" You're jumping pretty far ahead.\n\nFirst, make sure your son is okay. Get him checked out by a doctor. Keep receipts, but otherwise focus on making sure his burn isn't significant. (If it's healing fine on its own, then you can skip this, but pay attention to how it will affect the next steps.)\n\nThen, contact Nintendo's customer service and explain the situation. They'll almost certainly replace the charger if it's still under warranty, and they may offer to compensate you for your son's injury. If that covers your bills, you're done. If necessary, don't be afraid to escalate to a supervisor or to the company's upper management.\n\nFinally, if that doesn't produce results, you can contemplate a lawsuit. A lawyer specializing in product liability or personal injury is a good idea if your claim is over the small claims limit. u\/jaderust gave you a good rundown on the supporting information you'll likely need, as well, but your lawyer can advise you further.\n\nYou may want to get the outlet inspected by an electrician anyways, but expect to pay that out of your own pocket unless they find some solid indication that the outlet is damaged and that the damage is due to the charger."}

According to the HR person I spoke to, it's their policy.\n","answer":" They have zero obligation to tell you what they said."}

I plan to follow up with him tomorrow morning but I figured I would ask about this here.\n\nHow can a dog-friendly building ban the tenants from letting their dogs pee in the grass?  Do they expect us to drive somewhere?  \n","answer":" Yes, that is legal. A pet building doesn't need to allow the pets who inhabit the building to urinate\/defecate on the property.

You are aware of the dispute over property lines prior to sale, and purchasing without resolution can signal acceptance of the problem."}
{"question":"My friend (26F) was groomed by a male teacher from the age 13-17 (he was 27 at the time it started). He made her share nudes, so he had at some point child pornography in his hands, but he never raped her. The teachers at her school and his wife called her a home wrecker so she never dared to go to court with it at such a young age because she blamed herself. Now she’s scared he’s stilling grooming young girls as he still works at the same school and never actually did apologies for his behaviour. \n\nCan she take this to court, or at least tip of the police about a pedophile?\n","answer":" Do you know if he's still a teacher? You should definitely report him. Police should understand especially in 2019 that a report like this can be acceptably made 15 years later. Especially with the recent scandals where reports took over 30 years to be made( Jimmy Savile, Rolph Harris)Answer #2: Anyone can report a suspected crime to the police, who can forward it on to prosecutors. Based on statute of limitations, strength of evidence (testimony is evidence), and probably other factors I'm not thinking of, the prosecutors may choose to charge him with a crime.Answer #3: In addition to reporting this to police, consider reporting this to the State's Department of Education.  Every state has a board or office that issues licenses to teachers, and they can revoke those licenses for unbecoming conduct."}
{"question":"I am posting on behalf of a friend.\n\nFriend works as a dental assistant and recently had a capped needle break through the side of the cap as she picked it up and it entered her skin. The dentist bent the needle before putting the cap on for some reason. She immediately brought it to attention to the dentists who run the practice. She asked what protocol was because she was obviously concerned. They said they “don’t know” because this “hasn’t happened in years” and brushed it off. Friend tried to confront them again to see if the patient that used the needle in the first place should be tested for bloodborne pathogens and the dentists accused friend of saying the patient is hiding something. Friend had to seek blood tests on her own without help from employer but is still concerned. Is there any legal recourse here? Surely what they’re doing could be considered malpractice. \n\nPennsylvania\nTopic:\nMedicine and Malpractice\n","answer":" With a needle stick injury you should go to the ER as post exposure prophylaxis may be appropriate. It’s unlikely you could require the patient to get a blood test. It would count as a workplace injury not malpractice as your friend isn’t a patient but rather an employee.\n\n\nAs an aside it is bad practice to recap needles as this is when you are most likely to stick yourself, unless you have the type where the cap comes on and off from the side."}

I've never heard of this company so I did some digging and they seem legitimate. They don't seem large, though and I really am not sure what to do. Any ideas? They also sent me a legal document regarding rights but I'm not sure I understand the implications of it. Could use some help. \n\nI am in Eastern Kansas, United States. If  that matters.\n","answer":" Reviewing your contract or telling you what you \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" do is too close to forming an attorney\/client relationship for anyone to really advise you on it. Really, your best option is to go to an attorney with expeience in licensing and digital media. But who does that for a $100 transaction? Absolutely nobody. Maybe there is a more specialized non-legal sub where you can find out about other peoples experience doing this.\n\nThat said, I have a hobby business that generates a lot of similar offers with this piddley contracts with similar terms. The royalty sometimes comes through, sometimes does not. Still I have never looked back and been like \"fuck, I should have just sold it outright.\" You aren't monetizing it anyway, so as long as you aren't giving away your rights to future works or anything like that whats the harm. If it were me, I would probably license it and let them do the work, hope for a little mailbox money but if it never came through or amounted to anything I wouldn't be too upset. "}
{"question":"Hi there! My dad has been a landscaper for 25+ years.  He is getting sued for the first time for $5000 by a client that claims he is responsible for his new dogs urgent care fees. The puppy ate seeds (palm tree little orange seeds) and the owner claims it was my dads fault for not picking up all of the seeds. My dad had recently talked with the client about how he doesn’t work on palm trees but the client still requested it. Unfortunately his dog found some left over palm tree seeds and ate one, leading to his urgent care. The fees ended up being $5000 and he’s suing my dad. What help can my dad get? Does this person have a legit case? Some people need to be more responsible for their expensive puppies. That dog could of ate a grass, tree bark, seeds, dirt and the person would still blame it on my dad being his fault for not keeping his yard perfect for his puppy. \n","answer":" Your dad should consider reporting this to his business insurance.\n\nOtherwise, since the client has filed suit your dad should stop talking to the client and defend himself in court against the claim.Answer #2: The advice you're getting here is great - your dad needs to cut contact and lawyer up if he's getting sued. \n\nOne thing to also consider: If the palm tree is the one I think it is - [like this one](https:\/\/ucanr.edu\/blogs\/blogcore\/postdetail.cfm?postnum=13259) - the orange fruit are actually dates and are edible when ripe (even to people!) Dates are not toxic to dogs. Even if the client's puppy ate a seed, urgent care was likely an overreaction unless the dog was choking or showing some other harmful symptoms. \n\nSo apart from challenging liability, I would also heavily scrutinize the client's damages and the alleged \"harm\" their dog sustained. Answer #3: Because of the claim amount, under $10k - this was likely filed in small claims court. Lawyers are not allowed in small claims, but they can assist you in preparing a response and formulating a strategy. They cannot appear for you. You'll be hard pressed to find an attorney willing to spend time even talking to you for this amount. I recommend trying to find some help at an area law school - they usually have students serve as small claim facilitators. \n\nRegardless he shouldn't have much to fear about this case. Anyone who has palm trees and dogs knows this is a risk. The seeds grow year round, and even if you trim them, there's no guarantee that some won't fall into the yard. "}

{"question":"Location: Wisconsin \n\nFriend worked at a zoo. \n\nThere was literally a short blurb on the employment application that said, \"No cell phone pictures or video's of animals unless approved by owners.\"  \n\nThe pictures she took are of dead animals or animals in a severe state of neglect.  She wants to turn the photos in to the humane society but is scared.  \n\nShe has already lost her job due to reporting the neglect so that isn't the issue.   \n\nWhat legal implications is she facing if she releases the photos using a fake profile?\n\n\n\n\n","answer":" I think this isn't a great idea.  She should report the neglect to appropriate government agencies only, and be very careful what she says in public about the zoo's treatment of the animals there.  If she says false or misleading things she could be sued for libel.\n\nI wouldn't worry about the issue of what was said in the employment application, since she's already been fired."}

What could the father do\n\nChallenge the paternity in court. The court will order a certified DNA test.

{"question":"So my cousin has flat out said he will not pay me $3000 that is owed to me (2 months worth of wages working at his store) and that there is nothing I can do about it. It really feels like there is no way to get that money from him and I am not sure what to do. There is no evidence that I worked for him, either. He just never took my employee information down when we were working for him. Other than a few people who know this (our circle of friends), it feels like there is no way to prove he does actually owe me money and I feel powerless against it. Hoping to get some advice here. This is in the state of Wyoming.\n\n\n","answer":" Your cousin is in a significantly less advantageous position than you. You should not feel powerless. File an unpaid wages claim and watch as you get paid and your cousin ends up being discovered and paying a great deal more than 3000 in back-taxes, penalties, fines, and court costs to keep his store open. Don't forget that you also will need to pay taxes though. If you go legit, you still need to be accountable for all of the income you made under the table. Your cousin is not only screwing over you and the other employees, he is screwing over taxpayers. He needs to make things right, and you should not feel guilty for shining the light on him. It might be wise to have a lawyer help you navigate all of this, but you could potentially handle this all without a lawyer.Answer #2: What state do you live in?Answer #3: Wyoming is a one party consent state.

Some things to know are that he is a citizen of Cuba (where he currently resides) and of Spain. He has passports for both countries. Also, it is a gay relationship (I'm a guy too... not sure if that affects any legal issues).\n\nI'd like to know what to expect. How difficult will it be to keep him here? What kind of costs are we looking at? What do we need to do and how do we start this process? And if there is anything else helpful.\n\n(Edit) I should also note that he is currently in the US visiting family in Miami. I live in Texas so it's a bit of distance. Would it be beneficial to meet up with him to marry or at least meet in person? Would that speed the process up any?\n\nI appreciate everyones time!\nThanks!\n","answer":" Gay marriage to a Cuban?

{"question":"I dont know if this is the right place to post this but I just turned 15 and this afternoon my mum insisted i turn over my phone, computer, wallet and all my passwords to her. She said she wants to link my bank account to hers so she can have control of it, but I know she'll take my money esp. when i move out (she says i have to be out within 6 months of graduation, I graduate in oct 2020). And she wants all passwords not just bank etc. I don't know what else she wants to access. I said no and she yelled at me. She has since gone to work but she says there will be consequences if I dont have everything on the kitchen table with all my passwords written down on a bit of paper before she gets home.

She has never actually hit me or anything but she threatens to sometimes and she takes and destroys my stuff.\n","answer":" No. Your bank details are your bank details and no one is allowed to have possession of them except for you. Unless that account was opened by her for you, then no. She can scream and bitch and moan all she wants, but no. What I will recommend right off the bat is to contact your bank and request an immediate hold on all paper bank mailers to your house for your account. Have them delivered elsewhere. If she's as angry as you say she is, who's to say that she wouldn't go through your mail? Just because you live under her roof, does not mean that she is allowed to demand full access to your banking information. Answer #2: Sketchy AF. Don't give her any details. Hide your debit card.

{"question":"I've moved in this apartment 2 months ago with two cats. I had to pay a $200 non-refundable pet deposit, and a $100 refundable pet deposit. In addition, I'm paying an extra $35 per cat, per month. My therapist is about to register one of my cats as an Emotional Support Animal. From my understanding, landlords are required to waive these fees upon move-in and application, but I've already paid these and these cats were not ESA's at the time.\n\nCan I ask my landlord for the deposits back, and can my pet rents be refunded and waived for the rest of the lease? Therapist is only having one of the cats registered -- would it be trickier if one of the cats is not an ESA? (I didn't think of that, and it might not be too much trouble to register the other one as well).\n\nMost of my knowledge comes from here, especially section 12: https:\/\/www.animallaw.info\/article\/faqs-emotional-support-animals#s2\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" Assuming you already signed a lease and agreed to pay the pet deposit and monthly pet rent, no. Because that is a legal contract you agreed to, and landlords are tracking down and getting stricter with ESA animals. And truly, when it comes to ESA, my understanding is that only one is “allotted”. You shouldn’t need more than one animal to alleviate your “emotional support needs”. Answer #2: Your landlord must make the accommodation *after* you request it, and you paid that deposit and pet rent before you made the request.   \n\nAsking for a refund of the deposits or already-paid pet rent is an absolute non-starter.  There's nothing that suggests that a landlord must make a retroactive accommodation or refund pet rent that was paid according to the terms of your lease.\n\nYour therapist doesn't \"register\" your pets as ESAs;  if she thinks she does, she might not understand the law about psychiatric disability and service animals.   She needs to provide written information to your landlord that you have a psychiatric disability, and that your cats provide treatment for that disability.   If she's using one of those websites that purports to provide official documentation, she's wasting your money.\n\nYour landlord is going to be exceptionally skeptical.   I think they would be justified in refusing the waive the pet rent for a second animal if you somehow provide documentation that only one of your animals provides assistance for your psychiatric disability.\n\nGet your paperwork very clearly sorted before you make this request.   I absolutely would not attempt to ask the landlord to waive your pet rent and then provide documentation that's specific to just one of the cats, rather than focusing on your disability and the accommodations required to treat it with animal companionship."}

{"question":"My vehicle was involved in an a 3 car collision on Thursday. It was rear-ended by a 17 year old girl who had no insurance and had gotten (purchased or was gifted) the vehicle from a family member just the day prior (according to what she said).\n\nThis sent my vehicle into the car in front of it. The damage hasn't been assessed yet, but I'm sure the vehicle is totaled.\n\nWhen the insurance company was called I was informed that I only had liability insurance and that they wouldn't cover any of the damage.\n\nWhat can I do? About anything? I was told that it wasn't possible to only have liability on a car i was making payments on, so how did that happen? Is that just my fault or did someone else somewhere screw up?\n\nThe airbag didn't deploy when my car hit the one in front of it for what that's worth.\n\nI called a lawyer and they will likely be getting back to me on Monday, but I just want some advice on what to expect and what my options are.\n","answer":" Most lenders require you to carry full coverage on vehicles you're still making payments on.   That doesn't mean it's \"impossible\" for you to intentionally buy liability-only, it just means you're violating the terms of your loan and taking on a large risk.\n\nSome lenders, if they discover that you do not have full coverage, will \"force place\" comprehensive and collision coverage on your car and add it to your payments.   They will inform you of this.  It is very expensive.\n\nIt doesn't sound like that's the case with your insurance, but you'll want to talk to them again to be sure.   Get whatever paper records you have that show the \"declarations page\" or insurance card that describes the limits and coverages of your policy.\n\nThe airbag function is immaterial, especially if you weren't injured.   Airbags are designed to trigger in serious front-end collisions, and being rear-ended is the dynamic opposite of that, and airbags typically don't go off in those type of collisions.\n\nIt sounds like your recourse might be to sue the teenage driver and\/or her parents.    If the car had been purchased or gifted from a family member the previous day, it's very possible that person's insurance still covers it because the title paperwork hasn't been applied for yet."}

{"question":"It’s been almost 30 hours since my mom has gone missing. She took my grandpas trucks (which was very low on gas) and had $10. She’s very mentally unstable. We have already called all of the hospitals in the area.. especially the one 1 mile from her house which she is a regular at. We have checked all the surrounding jails rosters and no luck :\/ also logged into her Facebook and found nothing. She doesn’t have a cell phone. We have checked with her only friend. \n\n\nI’m getting really worried now and was wondering what the process is of filing a police report for a stolen truck? Would they arrest her and bring her right to jail and then we would have to pay to get the truck out of impound? How easy is it to drop charges once they find the truck? I feel like police looking for the truck is going to be out last resort and need to move fast.... \n\nForgive me if this isn’t the best subreddit and please direct me to the correct one. Need any advice.\n","answer":" If you report this as a stolen truck, there's a good chance she'll be convicted of theft if she's found alive. Furthermore, you'll prime the police to be expecting a criminal, not a woman in distress. If you're not prepared for that, don't ring that bell - you can't un-ring it, as dropping charges is a choice the prosecutor makes, not a choice you make.\n\nInstead, be honest with the police about your concerns. Thirty hours should be long enough to allow a plain old missing persons report, especially given her history of psychiatric disturbances and the circumstances of her disappearance. You can include that she took the truck without permission if you want, but by framing it this way, it's a lot more likely the police will be looking for someone who needs rescue, not someone who needs arresting."}

{"question":"I'm having a battle with my roommates right now. I moved into a new apartment, we do not have a lease, and they have always shoveled the snow. I told them legally, the landlord has to. They claim that only applies to the sidewalks, but our driveway, steps, basically everything else on the property is our responsibility. The MA gov websites seems pretty clear on the matter in my opinion, but they aren't agreeing. They don't want to push the landlord because they fear a rent increase. \n\nEDIT: I live in a single family house. \n","answer":" I was going to say it depends on your lease, but you don't have one. In that case I have no idea. At my old apartment the stairs down was the tenant's responsibility and the landlord took care of everything else. At the apartment before that I was responsible for everything except the parking spaces. At my current place I'm responsible for none of it.\n\nI'd say just shovel the driveway.

{"question":"Just wondering if not hiring someone based on their reason for being fired from their last job, when made public, could be reason to not hire that same person with any company that deals with the public.\n","answer":" Yes, \"we don't like your publicly available history\/PR\" is a perfectly valid reason not to hire someone."}
{"question":"Throw away for personal reasons- will try to make this short as well\n\nAfter class I was walking out with someone having a conversation. I saw a [fan that I thought had fallen over](http:\/\/imgur.com\/tmrieV5), it was a hot day so I assumed it was out for the kindness of the students\nWhile lifting it, I immediately fell into a manhole. \nEnded up skinning my legs and arms pretty bad\nI now get a blue screen error on my laptop whenever I open it to a certain degree or press on the screen to hard(touch screen functionality).\n\nWent to the doctors that night to check if I needed stitches. Did not fortunately.\n\nDon't care about the small copay from my doctor visit, but my laptop is another story. It still functions, but more like a desktop now. \n\nThe next day all manholes they were working inside had caution tape around them. \n\nIs this worth pursuing for damages on my laptop?  Should I hire someone to help me with this?\n\nI can answer any questions in a few hours. Thanks guys\n\n\n\n\n\n","answer":" So you already know from the other posts on here that you shouldn't have done what you did - not that it's that big of a deal, you were trying to be helpful. That being said, youre not 100% at fault. While the manhole was blocked and you removed the blockage, that is in no way a reasonable or safe way to secure a hazard. \n\nI wouldn't sue, but I'd contact the school *in person* and explain what happened and your damages, specifically your laptop. (Start with your Dean of Students office and ask who would be best to talk to about this.) Ask the school what theyre going to do better to block access to hazards on campus and to replace your laptop. Worst thing they can do is say no about your laptop.  Don't acknowledge your fault but don't assert blame either.  Any reasonable administrator or counsel for the school would see that paying you a couple thousand for a laptop is the easiest of fixes to potential future headaches from you. Plus, forgetting you personally, this is a safety issue that needs to be addressed. Answer #2: I don't see anyone you could sue over this.  There was an obvious hazard.  It was property that didn't belong to you, and you attempted to move it without permission from anyone.  This was 100% within your control.  And I honestly can't figure out how you managed to fall *into* a manhole while removing it's cover.  Answer #3: Thanks everyone for taking the time to comment. Sounds like I shouldn't have moved the fan! Oops!"}

{"question":"Hello first time here! I live in California. I had a job as a housekeeper but have recently quit. It was my first ever job and Had been there around 9 months. I handed in my letter of resignation the following day after I told my boss I quit. I quit Friday, handed to letter Saturday. To be honest he was actually the real reason I quit.

I wasn't a bad employee, in fact, I always finished my work on time and did extra (work that I should have probably got more pay on).\n\nAnyways, I asked my coworker to inquire my boss on when I would receive my final paycheck. He was told \"She'll get it when I'm finished with it.\"  \n\nHow long can he withhold my paycheck? Can he do this?

These cars are parked on driveways, not the public street.  Since when can a HOA start enforcing laws that the local counties are handling?  Is that legal?\n\nFYI my tags are not expired.

{"question":"here's my example: yesterday I was driving through an unfamiliar town and my phones GPS wasn't operating without a signal so I asked a couple of young boys (looked about 12 or so) for directions to my business appointment. They seemed willing and helpful and gave me the directions. HOWEVER when I followed them I ended up 10 miles out of the way in the opposite direction. I eventually did get to my appointment however my client was very upset about my tardiness and he refused to see me. It appears I lost out on this business opportunity.

I am considering going back to the town to hunt them down so I can find out who their parents are. Would I be able to sue them?\n","answer":" No, you can't successfully sue them.  And if you tried to, there's a very strong argument that you would be bringing a frivolous suit and you would be responsible for paying the other side's attorneys' fees.  No one is responsible for you knowing your directions in the absence of a GPS other than you.  Honestly, you should have known better than to rely on young children for directions.

{"question":"I rented a house and the lease says I am responsible for the mowing of the yard. I am not capable of doing it myself but wasn't worried about it because I figured I could just hire someone.\n\nSure enough I moved in and found a kid next door who was mowing a lawn, asked him if he wanted to make some extra money mowing mine, he said he'd do it for twenty bucks a week every Saturday. We've been happy ever since (since July).\n\nMy landlord was recently over to repair something while he was mowing and told me I am not allowed to pay someone else to do the mowing because it's a liability.  He said I either have to do it myself personally, or he will do it for $70 a week. He said $70 because he lives 45 minutes away so he has to account for his driving time and gas.  But obviously $70 is way more than $20 as you can see.\n\nIf the lease doesn't explicitly say I can't hire someone to do it instead of doing it myself, can he actually stop me? \n","answer":" I can't imagine the landlord has the power to say no.  You are leasing the property, you get to use the property as you want.  Just like the landlord can't tell you that you can't have guests over (if that's not in the lease) he can't tell you to not let someone mow your lawn.  It's different with things like plumbing and carpentry generally, but here the lease specifically gives you the power to mow the lawn.  And you can mow that lawn in any way you want, that is not forbidden by your lease.\n\nAdmittedly, it's possible that I'm wrong here, because I've literally never heard of anything like this before.  I have no idea on what grounds the landlord could refuse to let you do have the neighborhood kid mow the lawn, but don't use this advice as a hill to die on.  However, the fact that I've never even heard of anything like this leads me to believe you can tell your landlord to bugger off here.Answer #2: Interesting.  \n\nYour landlord thinks that if the kid hurts himself on the property, the landlord (or his homeowner's insurance) could have to pay the bills. He's probably right.\n\nI'd recommend hiring a commercial lawn service company. They have worker's comp insurance and business insurance, and if you give your landlord proof, he should be happy.\n\nYour rental insurance may cover the liability, you'd have to check with them. (You have rental insurance, correct????)   You'll have a harder time convincing your landlord, though. A commercial service would be an easier sell.\n\nGood luck."}

You first need to file a claim with their insurance and go that route because trying to sue a huge corporation like that isn't going to be cheap or easy. It isn't automatically their fault that you slipped and fell in their parking lot, you would need to prove that they were negligent in failing to keep their parking lot safe (ie did not plow or salt it at all) Just because it was icy doesn't mean they are at fault, as it is not reasonable to expect them to be able to rid the lot of 100% of all ice at every minute of the day."}

I have documented all the attempts to get the device back to the client.\n","answer":" I am not a lawyer, or Canadian, but since no one else has weighed in:\n\nIn most venues, a shopkeeper or service provider has a lien on property in their possession for the services and\/or storage they have placed on it.  This usually related to auto tow yards and mechanics (garage keepers as they are commonly called, and my dealings as an adjuster for insurance claims is how I am familiar with the possessory liens on impounded and repaired cars) but the principle applies to smaller chattel as well.\n\nCheck out here:  http:\/\/www.servicealberta.gov.ab.ca\/553.cfm#types  specifically under the section titled Possessory Liens Act.   This appears to clarify you do have a lien on their chattel (funny, I used that word earlier before I read it on this page).  So the short answer is yes, you would be able to eventually recoup the cost of your services based on the lien you places on the property.\n\nThe thing I don't know is what AB requires for you to properly notify (or attempt to notify) the owner of your intent to liquidate the asset as recovery against your lien, what time frame is required, and if\/how you may need to notify their apparent Personal Property Registry of this sale.   Hopefully someone else can weigh in, or that office can clarify if you contact them.   I hope this gets you started on the proper track, or someone else can give you more actionable advice."}

{"question":"A few months ago, I slipped in the shower and cracked our bathtub. The landlord brought in a 3rd party contractor to see if they could repair it, but the crack is too large.

You panic and reflexively shoot a nurse trying to perform a routine blood draw.Answer #2: If you shoot someone, you can almost always be prosecuted.  Whether it will go to trial, and whether you'll be found guilty, depends on whether a \"reasonable person\" would think that the needle represented a threat of death or serious harm.\n\nThe first \"reasonable person\" is the prosecutor, and the next is any member of the jury.

The fact that you are broke now doesn't mean that you will be broke in 6 months or 3 years.Answer #2: She is suing to get paid the money you owe her.  Not out of some odd vengeance. \n\nSuing helps ensure she gets paid. And extends her claim enforceability essential forever as long as she renews the judgment every seven years. And allows her to execute against your assets should you refuse to pay voluntarily. "}
{"question":"I'm working in a cafe in California with a tip jar. The tips are divided evenly among the employees based on hours worked for each shift. As it stands the supervisors share tips evenly with the rest of the staff and the owner takes all of the change from the tip jar home. Between the owner and the supervisor they are taking approximately $50\/day from the tip pool.     \n     \nI'm not sure how the law views tip jars. If it were pooled tips then the supervisors would never be allowed to participate, even if they were directly serving the tables; but I don't know if the law views the jar on the counter as a tip pool. The vast majority of the tips we receive come from credit cards, not from the jar.    \n      \nWhat is the legal recourse to take if I choose? What are the penalties for management that takes tips? How should I go about documenting anything? \n","answer":" The law views a tip jar as containing tips.  \n\nYou could make an unpaid wage complaint about your employer withholding tips you feel you are entitled to.  You would be entitled to your unpaid wages, plus possibly some additional penalties, if you prevail in that.\n\nIt could be hard for you to establish exactly how much the owner and supervisor are keeping.  They could be forced to turn over any documentation about it, though.  \n"}

{"question":"My mom is an insane stalker and she has a friend where I live in my hometown who is a Texas ranger. She always has threatened me she had a friend here who spied on me since I left home 7 years ago. \n\nI know she has had my friends plates ran before which is illegal enough but now apparently he has been patrolling by my house and running the plates every two he sees a new car here?

Another couple she has been stalking and harassing ( I know that's a whole other story) --knew the name of the Texas ranger and I know him.\n\nI'm pretty pissed and wanted to call immediately and talk to his supervisor or something but Im a little nervous of him retaliating? My mom's pretty psycho and I don't want to pick a fight with a crazy person but this pisses me off.\n","answer":" Sure, call their supervisor. I can find out a ton of information from any plate of any car I see on the road, so nothing illegal is going on here. Answer #2: Definitely proving not only that the ranger is the one driving by your home and running plates and feeding this info back to your mother seems high. If he is doing it, he is likely violating the ethics and policies of his job, however, I'm not sure it's necessarily illegal. \n\nYou'd be better off focusing on this real problem here - dear old mommy. Apply for that restraining order. Change your phone number and lock down or delete your social media. You may even want to consider moving, for your own peace of mind and sanity. \n\nGood luck OP. "}

{"question":"I used to have billpay set up to pay rent. We recently moved and no longer pay our old landlord, so we cancelled the automatic billpay. Noticed today that somehow another \"rent\" check went out and was cashed by our old landlord, who by the way, is not very responsive or responsible.\n\nI called Ally and they said that because of a new system switch, many auto billpays that have been cancelled have been accidentally reactivated, including ours. They refuse to credit our account and said the best they can do is to start a dispute and will try to get in touch with the payee. Meanwhile they suggested that the best way to resolve is for us to ask our old landlord for the money back.\n\nSo long story short, Ally admits their mistake, they took funds out of our account and sent it to a third party, and now they expect us to track it down.

That's pretty bad that they sent out a payment after you cancelled it.Answer #2: IANAL, but I am a bank regulator.\n\nAlly is primarily regulated by the FDIC.  I would suggest contacting the FDIC Consumer Response Center.  Additionally, you can look to file a complaint with the CFPB, they might not be able to help directly, but should be able to point you in the right direction.Answer #3: The bank should refund you and pursue the landlord on their own dime.

{"question":"I've been working at my current job for close to a year now so I decided to inquire about signing up for a 401(k). I've known that my employer's policy requires employment for 12 months, so that's why I've waited. But now I'm being told that only full-time employees who work 40 hours\/week are eligible to sign up. I work 8 am - 5 pm, 3 days per week. That is 24 hours\/week, around 1200 hours\/year.

{"question":"If I were attacked by another individual while swimming at the beach in FL, could I drown the individual in self defense? Would the stand your ground law be applicable here?\n\nThank you\n","answer":" Drowning is deadly force. It is extremely doubtful that drowning someone at the beach is going to qualify as legitimate self defense let alone be covered under any stand your ground laws. There are just ever so many better ways to stop someone from attacking you than by holding them underwater until they die and the police\/courts will recognize this.Answer #2: Deliberately drowning a person would be hard to justify as \"self-defense\".\n\nSomething like shoving a person away, they trip, hit their head, and accidentally drown could almost certainly be successfully argued to be self-defense.  But actively drowning a person ... well, it's not like on TV.  It's not \"head enters water, 10 seconds later they're dead\".  It's several minutes of fighting the person to keep their head under water enough so that they can't breathe (while they're holding their breath), then once they do inhale water to keep them there longer while they actually drown (up to a minute for an adult), and the whole time they're fighting you trying to, well, not die.\n\nIt's not *impossible* that this could be ruled self-defense, but taking five minutes (or more depending on how hard they fight you) to kill a person is much *harder* to defend than something like \"He was coming at me so I shot him\"."}
{"question":"I just had one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a cop. I was driving down a highway in Arkansas at a speed I won't specify. A cop passed me and pulled me over. Okay.

I then told him \"I'm unemployed, thanks\" as he's about to leave.

I have two tickets that say different speeds detected on radar. Can I contact the prosecutor or judge about this?\n","answer":" It's not double Jeopardy. You aren't being prosecuted twice.\n\nIt sounds like he was trying to cut you slack by issuing a citation for a lower speed than he clocked you at.\n\nIs the speed on the ticket (not the voided one) correct? If so, then you are out of luck.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is at the officer's discretion to write you a ticket, angering the officer by talking back is likely to encourage a more severe penalty."}

Answer #2: If I may ask, If you can legally conceal carry why do you sometimes open carry?Answer #3: They could attempt to terminate your lease.

{"question":"[NYC] I’m about to sign my first lease. The application said $2,000\/month. Now the lease says it’s $2,900\/month with a clause noting it’s $2,000\/month so long as you pay within the first 10 days of the month. So essentially a $900 late fee. I plan on paying rent on time so it shouldn’t pose an issue except that it seems weird to me. The apartment is not rent controlled and online it seems the landlord can charge any late fee they want, so this presentation seems weird. I wanted to know if I was missing something. Thanks!\nTopic:\nLandlord Tenant Housing\n","answer":" That’s not a $900 late fee. It’s a $900 discount for paying on time. That difference is important. If you sign you’ve agreed to rent at $2,900 so it would be challenging to argue you shouldn’t pay that. \n\nJust because it’s a scheme doesn’t mean it’s illegal. If you don’t like those terms don’t agree to them. Answer #2: Nothing illegal about that, it's just a stiff penalty for you to ensure your rent is in on time. Answer #3: The landlord is trying to get around any potential late fee rules by giving a discount for timely rent. The only issue is the possible bait and switch with applicant and lease, I don’t know if that applicable though cause applications may not be binding nor have any reason why the rent needs to be listed. Answer #4: Check to see if the apartment is rent controlled\/stabilized. This almost sounds like a scheme by the landlord to report a higher rent than they're actually charging. Shady landlords do this because once they reach the magic threshold set by the Dept. of Buildings, they can take the apartment off the rent control list and charge market rates."}

Hence the nature of a gift -- you give it without expectation of giving it back. What counts here is whether this went to you and your wife, or your wife. You would be well-served by consulting with a divorce attorney to be sure. "}
{"question":"Tried to make an eye catching title for a kinda bland question. \n\nI know under most laws, including the US, it's illegal to hit someone with... well anything... especially a car. I was watching  r\/Roadcam where someone hit a bike thief and this was brought up. I was wondering... is there a difference between hitting someone with a car, and pulling completely out in front of them where they have no room to stop? If so, where does the line of someone hurting themselves vs being assaulted more or less lie. I understand there's a lot of maybe in law, but I good reference would be nice.\n","answer":" I think if someone did assault themselves they wouldn't face any criminal charges but you would be looking a compulsory stay at a psychiatric facility assuming you survived. Answer #2: If you pull your car out in front of someone and they hit you, then you can be said to have assaulted them even if they are in the striking vehicle.  The standard in my state for felony assault is something like \"knowingly cause or attempt to cause serious injury to the other person.\"\n\nThat could easily fit that set of circumstances.\n\n"}
{"question":"Reddit, I have made a terrible mistake. I started out a relationship two years ago with someone who has turned out to be a nightmare. I tried to help her while we were dating by signing a common law marriage form that was notarized and allowed her to get on my insurance. Since then, we have bought a car together and other large purchases. When I finally said I have had enough, she has contacted a lawyer (this would have been her 3rd marriage).....I know, I know, I know... Turns out that she has been saving texts from arguments and many other things. I have never been married, nor engaged and she is 12 years my senior. I do not know where to even begin, but if there is anyone out there that can help, please do! This common law marriage did not seem that it could hold water and I wanted to make sure I am not digging myself deeper by not taking action or any other actions I take. I am taking deep breaths but truly panicking.\n","answer":" Your common law marriage is valid. There's no time requirement in Alabama like other states. "}

{"question":"I am a supervisor at my work, in British Columbia, Canada. When I was promoted to this position I was told that we could not leave the site for our breaks, we had to always be available for duty. I was told by another supervisor that she had asked about getting payment for breaks, as is required by law, but was essentially told if she brought it up again she would lose her position.\n\nI've been a supervisor for 2 years now, and a change in upper management, as well as some new supervisors being hired, has brought this issue up again. They decided they would start to pay for our meal breaks.\n\nMy question is, can I get them to retroactively pay for our breaks? 2 years of unpaid half hour breaks, not to mention countless times that, had they paid for our meal breaks, would have put me into overtime, it's a significant sum. Apparently they told one of the other supervisors that they would not pay retroactively.\n","answer":" You can get help through the Ministry of Labour to find out if you were entitled to paid breaks all along, and to receive back pay if you were and if you cannot resolve this with management yourself: https:\/\/www.labour.gov.bc.ca\/esb\/\n\nKeep in mind, they will not investigate a complaint unless you can give them some evidence that self-help was tried: e.g. you and your coworkers wrote management a letter bringing up the fact that you should have been paid for your breaks.  a written statement from your co-worker who asked and was told her job was in danger might be sufficient here.\n\nSo step 1 is to call them and find out what your rights are.\n\nStep 2 is to notify the employer of your rights, or provide evidence this was already tried.\n\nStep 3 is to make a complaint."}

If a court finds that any provision of this Lease is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited.\"\n","answer":" It means pretty much what it says -- if the lease includes an unenforceable provision, only that provision is unenforceable.   The rest of the lease is still valid.\n\nExample:  The lease says you can't wear purple clothes in your house.  The landlord finds out you wear purple clothes and tries to have you evicted.

To that end, the law allows four primary means of service: personal service, meaning that the Summons and Complaint are personally handed to the person being sued; service upon some third person at the defendant's residence, if the third person is over age 14 and resides there; service at the defendant's place of employment, to a person who appears to be in charge or responsible for receiving papers; and, finally, service by mail, with two copies: one regular first-class mail, and one certified, with a return receipt.\" A lawyer can confirm.  However,  notification is another matter.  "}
{"question":"The petty cash would amount to only 100 dollars every few months. It would be deposited into my account and I would collect it in order to buy small office supplies.\n\nI asked if the petty cash could instead be deposited into the office expense account (which we have and regularly use) but was told that the responsibility was considered too small to be handled by management.\n","answer":" Could you have them put it on a prepaid card of some kind if you aren't comfortable with the bank deposit?Answer #2: No, I wouldn't agree to this. The company can easily spend $20 to buy a drawer safe like [this one](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Key-Lock-Security-Box-Safe\/dp\/B003R5086Q\/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=undefined&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kds-1), put in the $100 and top it off every few months, and give you the key. Then all you need to do is include the receipt and keep a spreadsheet of what you spent the money on.Answer #3: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n&lt;breath&gt;\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nNo.  They should give you a prepaid credit card, perhaps.  Keep your receipts.Answer #4: Absolutely not. For one thing, if you ever get audited the IRS will see cash inflow from your employer to you which looks like you're getting paid an extra $100\/month you aren't reporting as income, lets avoid that. \n\nYour company needs to keep company funds in its own account to avoid any problems. Answer #5: I would be very worried that they might turn around and blame you for missing money.  They could also claim no office supplies were bought, and try to take it back, or any number of potentially awful things.\n\nOffer them a compromise.  Create a petty cash checking account in the company's name, and give you access to that account.  That way it's very easy to see that it has only ever been spent on office supplies, and has never e.g. had cash withdrawals from an ATM, or been swiped at a liquor store.  That should satisfy their desire to have you deal with the money instead of them, and stave off any potential accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nIf they refuse that, I'd worry that they might be setting you up to be fired.  They might not be, but I'd still worry."}

{"question":"My grandfather purchased 2 plots about 25 years ago at a very large local cemetery. We recently decided to sell the plots. We went to the cemetery to verify the location and take pictures of the area and were told that one of the plots had been double sold by accident, and that someone was already buried in the out plot. The cemetery told us that they would just give us another plot to replace that one. \nI've never had any dealings with this type of thing and and currently researching how to handle it. I spoke to the State of Florida Funeral and Cemetery Services and they advised me to hear the cemetery out and see what they are willing to do. I plan on doing this but would also like to know before hand what options I may have for repercussion. \nWe paid $2000 for each plot, they double sold one of them. New plots in the same area are worth $4300 each. Ideally, I would like them to buy back both lots at $8600 and be done with it.  \n\nAny insight is appreciated. \n","answer":" As long as the plot they are offering is equal quality to the one you purchased, you won't really be able to take any legal action.\n\nThey are under no obligation to buy back your plots. If they did (NOT likely), it would be at the same price they were purchased for.Answer #2: The sale of a cemetery lot is not a real property transaction. Rather, it confers a right of burial.\n\nBecause of this, it's a breach of contract action. Your damages are $2000.00 (or maybe $4000.00, if the argument that the value of the lots is only as a pair flies).\n\nSo what you're negotiating for is a pair of replacement plots if you still want them, or $4000.00 and you surrender the remaining plot, or $2000.00 and you sell the remaining plot privately if the plots are currently going for more than $2000.00.Answer #3: &gt; New plots in the same area are worth $4300 each. Ideally, I would like them to buy back both lots at $8600 and be done with it.\n\n That's not going to happen."}

{"question":"New Mexico, USA \n\nMy girlfriend and I moved into a condo in July, and signed a lease which included our pets: a cat and a dog (a labrador retriever).

We have not spoken to the condo's owner or the HOA directly. The rental agents are saying we can vacate without lease-breaking fines or get rid of the dog.

We are unable to make this tight window with three small children and no help. We've even paid the dues and they still send the threats. What can we do?\n","answer":" It depends where you are, but the HOA covenants should have showed up in your title work when you bought the house. If they didn't, either you're not really in the HOA (don't owe dues) or your title insurance company has some explaining to do. Try and get an explanation from your title company\/closing officer - they should have some more insight before you spend any money with an attorney, but that is probably where this should go. \nAnd - also depending on where you are - the HOA can't \"DO\" much - they'll put a lien on your property, but typically they are not allowed to actually foreclose on that lien (evict you, etc.). But you'll have to ask someone familiar with the laws in your area. Answer #2: Depending on the situation this might be something title insurance can cover (at least for the past due fees). \n\nYou need to find out for sure whether or not you are governed by the HOA. Where you go for that info will depend on the location, but generally you can find restrictive covenants at the county recorders office.Answer #3: &gt; We've even paid the dues and they still send the threats. \n\nWhat do you mean?  You've paid the past-due bill(or whatever)?  What is the issue, then?Answer #4: This makes no sense - the people who sold you this house were legally required to disclose this information to you.

{"question":"Tommorrow I have a flight from Spain to Miami, and then I will grab another flight from Miami to Honduras. Today I got the notification to do the online check in. After writing all my info, the website told me I couldn't do the check in because my passport expires in less than 6 months. Is this an issue I can resolve by going to the airport, or is it more serious than that?\n","answer":" You will have to clear immigration in Miami, even for a short transit period. The US requires that your passport be valid for 6 months beyond “the initial period of contemplated stay” in the US. It looks like you are missing that 6 months by just a few days.\n\nHowever, the US has treaties with a number of countries so that passports from those countries are are exempt from the 6-month’s requirement. If you hold a passport from [one of the countries on this list](https:\/\/fam.state.gov\/fam\/09FAM\/09FAM040309.html#M403_9_3_B_2) you will not have a problem. Honduras, unfortunately, is not on the list.Answer #2: You are traveling on a Honduran passport? \n\n[Here's more on the six-month rule.](https:\/\/www.fastportpassport.com\/blog\/six-month-validity-passport-rule\/)\n\nThe computer system probably just flags any expiration date shy of six months in case you are going to a country that imposes this rule. It is a requirement of the Honduran government, but if you are a Honduran citizen with a Honduran passport you should be fine."}

{"question":"I was stopped at a checkpoint, possibly because I was not wearing a seat belt, and once the officer looked at me he decided I was under the influence. The exact exchange between the officer and myself is not clear in my mind. To make matters more interesting the officer was wearing a body camera. I am pretty sure I outright refused the field sobriety test and maybe the breathalyzer too as that test was never done. No blood work was done either. \n\nI am wondering if I should plea guilty since I'll likely look drunk on the camera or if I should plea not guilty since they did not take any blood alcohol test or if I will get the DUI regardless because I refused the tests.   \n\nAlso, I got charged for failure to obey police and obstruction but do not know what I said or did to get these charges and do not know how to approach them at all. \n\nEDIT: This happened in WV. It turns out to be a drugs DUI and not alcohol. \n","answer":" That you don't remember the incident does not work in your favor. Find a local DUI defense attorney and listen to them.Answer #2: If you don't know what you were doing, and can't even remember your interaction with the officer, it's very, very unlikely you would prevail at trial.  Your own testimony makes it obvious that you were impaired.\n\nIf you want to go this route, get an attorney. Answer #3: The observations of the officer during the interaction can be used as evidence to convict you of DWI.\n\nIf you were drunk enough that you don't remember what happened, then your chances of being found not guilty seem pretty slim to me.\n\nGet a lawyer and ideally you'll get a favorable plea bargain.Answer #4: You didn't post location. In many states, refusing the breathalyzer will get your license suspended automatically. Then you still have to deal with whatever they have against you for the DUI."}

{"question":"My wife was a child actress back in her teens.  Her family\/parents are abusive and manipulative and throughout the course of her growing up she was told it was against the law for her to see how much money she made.

It basically means any type of technology developed at the company becomes the IP of that company.Answer #2: I am not a lawyer but a software engineer who has seen these things before. Legally they do tend to be enforceable and I've seen people get in trouble by thinking these can't be enforced. That said, in my experience most companies have a less strict form of this that they will use if someone raises a stink. Your husband should refuse to sign this and ask for an amended version that limits it to inventions made on company time with company owned equipment.

We didnt even get arrested, and were told that it would NOT go down exactly how my insurance says it has. \n","answer":" There are two different parties here, the state and the insurance company.\n\nThe state charged you with an open container violation and trespassing. Assuming that you paid the fine for it, that's what it will remain, and it's now over with.\n\nMeanwhile your insurance company sees a report that you, underage, were driving with an open container. They are choosing to treat this like a DUI for the purposes of insurance risk calculations (which makes a lot of sense, if you think about it, since an open container in a car with an underage driver is one sip from turning into a dui).  You can appeal the ruling or find another insurance provider. In the meantime, pull a copy of your driving record from the state to make sure it is accurate."}

Send them a copy of the agreement she signed. Sorry about your dog, good luck.Answer #2: If it is worth going back to court for your puppeh, get a lawyer and file contempt of court.  She violated your agreement; it's pretty clear cut.Answer #3: So she doesn't reside where she works? But you can hire a private investigator to track her down."}
{"question":"So my girlfriend and I are in the process of looking for new employment, and she is worried that the university she attended will not confirm to potential employers she is a graduate. She successfully completed all coursework, but is still paying on what she owes the school. It isn't a federal loan, but funds actually owed directly to the school.

{"question":"If I was an air traffic controller, and I passed the initial pre employment drug screening and was hired.

And if I do, how likely would try employer be to persue action considering I’m a good worker?\n","answer":" Yes you can be fired for testing positive for marijuana if that is the policy of your workplace.Answer #2: Yes you can be fired. There are thousands of positions in recreational states that still will fire you for usage. Especially in your field. Stop smoking and keep the good job.Answer #3: In the U.S. I'm pretty sure air traffic controllers are all employed by the FAA (or at least the vast, vast, vast, majority).  They're federal employees.  There's all kinds of medical tests and [health conditions you can't have and medications you can't be on while working in that job](https:\/\/www.faa.gov\/other_visit\/aviation_industry\/designees_delegations\/designee_types\/ame\/amcs\/media\/3930.3B%20AME%20Summary%20Sheet.pdf).

It will be impossible to make ends meet with the loss of income.   \nCan I go ahead and ask for a reduction now or do I have to wait?   \nAlso, I can't afford a lawyer so I'm going to have to do this myself.\n","answer":" Contact the child support enforcement agency helpline for your state. You will need to go back to court and file a motion. I would start saving for a lawyer if she can’t be civil w you. \n\nAnd 40 miles is not that far; just don’t move.  Answer #2: I would speak to a family law attorney first. Courts do not always modify child support payments if a person gives up a source of income voluntarily. You have a good reason for it, perhaps, but don't move without running this by someone who is experienced in your local family courts."}
{"question":"I've had 4 Amazon packages delivered to the neighbors below me. The package is always opened when he returns it too. There were a couple of times where he came upstairs and hand delivered the package to me with my room mate standing behind me . I want to do something besides cursing him out when he walks his dog. Is there anything I can do legally without confrontation ? \n","answer":" \"Hey, stop doing that.\" \n\nOr contact the post office to make a complaint.\n\nWhy is he getting your packages? Can you leave a note telling them a better way to deliver your packages?Answer #2: I would be more irritated at the delivery service for constantly misdelivering the packages. \n\nHonestly, in this day and age, consider yourself lucky that he’s bringing them to you at all. If you get angry at the neighbor you may never get any mis delivered packages from them again. I know it sucks but take it up with usps, amazon curriers, ups or fed ex. Answer #3: Maybe he orders a lot on Amazon and is doing it by mistake? Ask him politely to double check the name and address before opening them. \n\nYou could also contact the PO and complain. Answer #4: Not legal advice but amazon advice. Go to customer chat and let them know your package was delivered to the wrong place. \n\nTheir logistic software is crap and we walked through which building and floor mine was in the apt complex so now they have a lot of notes on my account to improve. The person on chat and I were both on google maps and used all sorts of landmarks to make it as easy as possible for them to find. Answer #5: Realistically speaking I think you should consider whether or not it's malicious. When I get a package I don't check the name on it, I go \"Oh cool! A package!\" and rip it open. Is he just noticing that it's not the item he was expecting once it's open?"}

He intends to just keep the down payment and call it good. Is this legal? If so what should we keep in mind?

If you are making payments on the loan, whatever your dad does with the money is his business. So if he wants to give you the money to repair the car it's ok. If you default on the loan then then the car can be repossessed. "}
{"question":"I am tasked with finding legal representation for a friend who found himself in a big mess overnight. The friend is accused of a serious crime, with up to life in prison for the particular offense. I have found a lawyer (online), that has visited said friend multiple times. The criminal defense attorney is willing to take on my friend as a client, with a $20,000 retainer. His hourly is $600+, with $200+ hourlies for associates\/investigators\/etc. \n\n\nAre these reasonable numbers? Anything I should look out for? Where can I find a third party attorney to look over this matter before signing?\n\n\nAdditionally, what are common ways to finance retainer fees? Credit card? Loans? House mortgage?\n","answer":" If you're having to finance even the retainer fee, you can't afford this lawyer. Answer #2: He's going to run out of money.  Let's be blunt - the guy will be bankrupt as a consequence of this case.  That said, federal cases have staggeringly high conviction and plea rates, so his life is very likely over regardless of the financial hit. \n\n$600 is a lot, but if he's in a niche area of the law, it may not be unreasonable.  It is not uncommon for people to sell their homes, max their credit cards, beg from family, etc. to fund these levels of cases.

{"question":"I have a younger brother that still lives with my parents.

He’s been smoking weed since he was 14 years old (18 now).  \n\nHe’s always cost my parents their security deposits. Yesterday we all had the last straw, he went on a violent rampage that ended in him getting physical with me and my dad. He sells weed, and occasionally I see some pills around. \n\n\nAlso, he’s been arrested twice as a juvenile, but was not charged either time.

We live in an upper middle class suburb, but he managed to find friends involved with gun violence and who knows what else. \n","answer":" &gt; Is there a way to alert the police without implicating my parents or me?\n\nNo.  You can make your report, and offer your testimony that the drugs belong to your brother and not to you, but the cops don't have to believe you and you can't prevent being charged for it.  \n\nHaving said that, if your brother is running with a rough crowd, he may very well be under police attention already.

{"question":"I watched a video the other day where a person described being covered in gore after an act of violence. At the time, they were a minor.   \nEvidence was combed from their hair, collected off of their skin, and even their clothes were confiscated, in a thorough (from the persons point of view) process that took several hours.  \nWhen this minor's parents were finally informed and had arrived, the child (who had been through something horrific and traumatizing) was sharply chastised for trying to seek comfort- A hug from their mother.\n\nAt what point does the argument for preserving whatever evidence might have still been left override that child's autonomy or that mothers desire to intervene and say 'no, my child needs to be comforted right now'?  \nFrom a strictly-legal standpoint, not a moral one, were these police doing what they were supposed to do in preserving evidence, or was this demand something else?\n","answer":" &gt;From a strictly-legal standpoint, not a moral one, were these police doing what they were supposed to do in preserving evidence, or was this demand something else?\n\nIt depends on if they were actually done collecting evidence from the child. Every little bit of physical evidence tells a story. Blood splatter, trace, DNA, hair, dirt in the grooves of the shoe, spit in a bite, it's all important to collect it prior to the victim getting cross contaminated. \n\nBlood splatter, for example, can change if some of it transfers off. Defense is going to argue that it's not a reliable indicator indicator because blood got smeared. Or the parent is a suspect\/not a suspect, because a hair\/skin cells were found in the blood, giving the defence attorney reasonable doubt. \n\nJust basically any kind of potential contamination is a huge problem that could get the killer off the hook. \n\nAs far as it being legal, yes. The police can detain you long enough to get a warrent to collect what is obviously evidence of a violent felony, and collect it. Even if it's a minor and the parents don't consent. \n\nIt's tricker when it's sexual assault. Courts general won't force a sexual assault kit collection on a minor, just like a adult."}

You then will need to fill out an affidavit setting forth certain facts about the judgment debtor (last known address, etc) together with certain facts about the judgment (that it hasn't been paid and hasn't been appealed).  Here is a link to the website for Dade County (Miami) that gives better details:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.miami-dadeclerk.com\/courts_civil_foreign_judgment.asp\n\nNot a Florida lawyer (and definitely not your lawyer) but my understanding is that Florida's homestead exemption protects a person's residence from being sold to pay judgment debts.  So it is worthwhile to think about what other assets the debtor might have that you could get to.  Did you sue a company for your judgment? If so, and that company has nothing, you can't go after the owner's other companies without filing a lawsuit showing grounds to do so (hint: this is a high burden to carry and you would definitely need competent legal advice to do so, from an attorney licensed in Florida).  \n\nTL;DR: Don't throw good money after bad."}

Only if you're reported could you face actual charges.\n\nIf you are reported to the police and the police come to speak with you DO NOT speak with them without an attorney present. You have to tell them that specifically, that you will not speak to them without an attorney and then stop talking to them until the attorney comes. Don't answer any question without your attorney there, not even to confirm what the school reported you for.Answer #2: It [looks like](https:\/\/law.justia.com\/codes\/new-mexico\/2006\/nmrc\/jd_30-31-23-cab3.html) possession of a schedule IV controlled substance like Xanax is normally a misdomeanor and is “punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500) or more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by imprisonment for a definite term less than one year, or both”. \n\nHowever, since it took place in a “Drug free school zone”, it’s a Class D felony, with an 18 month sentence. \n\nThis isn’t something you can try and keep from your parents.

They told us we could pay 10 percent of the bond but is it really worth paying it? she is also pregnant. Anybody has a idea of what could happen if found guilty? (most definitely she is)  does she have any hopes at all? should we bother getting a Attorney? all this looks and sounds so expensive and we not ready for it. Any direction would be greatly appreciated.  she is 19 years old.\n","answer":" I would not pay bond. Let her sit in jail - at least you know she'll be eating, have some pre-natal medical care, and (hopefully) won't have access to alcohol and drugs.\n\nIf you (family) can afford it, a criminal defense lawyer wouldn't be a bad idea. The other option is for her to get a public defender. (I'm assuming she has no money.)\n\n"}

{"question":"A sixteen yr old is accusing two over 21 relatives of molestation.  They both deny it.  They are devasted because they are both married and the father of the girl is threating to call the police if they do not leave town.

The girl is known to sleep around with different older boys cuts herself and keeps saying no one loves her among other things.  I want to help but do not know how.  This is happening in California.  \n","answer":" They should NOT talk about ANYTHING related, semi-related, or ~~unrelated~~ (oops went too far, but you get my point) to this situation to ANYONE without their lawyer present.  And especially not to the police.  Even (ESPECIALLY!) if they threaten arrest, promise to \"make it go away\", or some similar common tactic.Answer #2: &gt;The girl is known to sleep around with different older boys cuts herself and keeps saying no one loves her among other things.\n\nThese are all signs of abuse, FYI.Answer #3: If the police contact them at all they do not say a damn thing without their lawyer present.  \"Having a chat to clear things up\" really means \"Lets see how much I can get out of you to use against you in court\".\n\nAs for the girl, she may actually have been or is being molested by someone else and the accusations against the two are a way of acting out.  Her actions as you describe them scream 'cry for help', and it would seem to be a good idea to look into them.

{"question":"When I turned 18. My parents took me downtown to a city building and told me to sign some paperwork. I had no idea what I was doing. I didn't question it (yeah I'm stupid). Years later. We got into a huge argument and I was kicked out. My sister eventually told me that the house is actually in my name, and that bills are coming in my name. I have no paperwork of ownership. Can I legally just take the house? One bill was unpaid and went into collections. I didn't know about it either. Can I also sue for the amount?\n\nEdit: I live in California.\n","answer":" Go down to city hall, pull the property records, and find out if it's actually true. Then proceed from there. If you do own the property, then you're liable for the taxes and may be liable for the public utilities if the current occupants default on them. If you don't, don't sweat any of this.\n\nIf you discover that you do own the property, you should speak to a real estate lawyer before doing anything. It may be possible to unwind the transfer (though I'd personally guess that it's unlikely), or you may have some enforceable right to remain on the property, or you may even be the sole owner, in which case you may be able to evict your parents or sell the property and keep some or all of the proceeds.\n\nYou should also pull your credit report, and ensure they haven't opened other accounts in your name."}

I'm referring to off-site, paid, non-work related events that involve \"fun\", no work talk. \n\nI have always had panic disorder and agoraphobia, and I was very open about it when applying. Every time a work event comes up, my supervisor seems to be uncomfortable or upset. I'm really, really worried that my disability will get me fired.

Possession of less than one ounce is now treated as an infraction in California.  So you are not entitled to a public defender.\n\nIf its your first appearance, ask if there is a diversion program that could lead to dismissal, like drug court or some other program.  If not, decide what you want to do.  If you want your best chance at a dismissal or reduced charge, you need to find an attorney, so plead not guilty and go find the money for one.

I am almost 30 but I have only seen him four times :(\nTopic:\nCustody Divorce and Family\n","answer":" It sounds like he doesn't want to petition on your behalf. \n\nIf he submitted false information on his initial petition (like claiming not to have any children, when he knew he had them), that could be considered \" Concealment of Material Fact or Willful Misrepresentation\" to immigration officials, which is one of the few ways a naturalized citizen could [have their citizenship revoked](https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/uscode\/text\/8\/1451). That's fairly unlikely though. It sounds more like he's using that as an excuse not to even try. \n\nHowever, even if he did petition for you, adult children of US citizens are not \"Immediate Relatives\" given first priority of admission to get a green card. It would take several years to process your application (anywhere from 7-19 years, depending on which country you're from. If you're married, it would take even longer, but your spouse and kids could come too).  And there are additional requirement needed to prove he is actually your father, especially if your parents were never married.  "}

{"question":"I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I couldn't think of a better one. If there's a better sub for this question, please let me know and I'll move it over there.\n\nI am looking for a federal equivalent of California Welfare and Institutions Code 5150 which provides that police officers, health care providers and others have the capacity to involuntarily hold a patient for 72 hours (or 14 or 30 days, per WIC 5250 &amp; 5270) if they are deemed to be a danger to themselves (or to others). I know that individual states have specific versions of this main theme, but I was wondering if there was a federal equivalent that would allow me to use one citation instead of 50. I was considering [42 USC 1997](https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/crt\/civil-rights-institutionalized-persons), but it seems to be talking more about the rights of institutionalized people, rather than that people can be institutionalized for X, Y, Z. \n","answer":" This is a state matter, so you would, generally, need to cite the correct statute for that state.  \n\nI don't know that there is a federal statute.

{"question":"This sucks.  I hate addiction and breakups.  I got a DUI in 2010 in CA then one last month in AZ and then last night I flipped my truck on The busy 101.  I don't want to go to prison.  All my family lives back in the southeast.  Should I just pick up and leave?  Would I still be able to have a Valid Tennessee license?  I'm 28 feels like I just ruined my life and as I sit her sobbing part of me wishes I didn't put my seat belt on last night.\n","answer":" No, you should find an AA meeting, then a lawyer.Answer #2: What state? By your use of \"101\" I'm going to assume CA - in which case according to [this website](https:\/\/www.avvo.com\/legal-guides\/ugc\/what-makes-a-dui-a-felony-in-california) your third DUI isn't a felony. However your fourth will be. \n\nIf you think your family would provide support - once you finish your criminal matters you can and should seek that out.  Three DUI's is more than a warning - you are bottoming out. \n\nDon't sit there sobbing.  I guarantee you that there is an AA meeting starting in the next few hours somewhere near you.  Get there. It may not be the right program for you long term, but it might help now. \n\nGood luck - worse people than you have beaten alcohol addiction so you can too.  Answer #3: You are incredibly lucky to be in CA, most states would autofelony a third DUI. \n\n\n\n\nOnce you inevitably get an interlock device and finish the amount of time they prescribe (which will require staying in Cali for monthly inspections) and probation (likely also requires staying in Cali) move to a place with solid transit and never ever own a car again.

{"question":"Is it reasonable to expect that internet should have same laws as real world?\n\nThis is sometimes expressed. But I've been perceiving that the internet communication simply does not follow the same psychology as real world. Thus I find that the idea of internet being governed by same laws does not fully hold.\n\nIt may hold in cases such as causing a libel by e.g. publishing photo manipulations. But when it comes to e.g. \"troll content\", then this is where I find that the internet culture simply deviates from how people behave in the real world.\n","answer":" The internet is part of the real world. Defamation laws apply to the internet.Answer #2: You seem to be overlooking the fact that the internet is not a physical location. People are held to the laws in the jurisdiction where they stand or act. You can't create an internetland system of jurisprudence, simply because nobody in fact lives in the internet.  \n\nAnything beyond that is a question for philosophers, not so much attorneys."}

I received a letter from the RMV telling me that my default date was June 29th and I no longer had the option to contest it and they racked on $85 late fee. This means my letter sat for 6 days before being processed. Plus it was post marked for the 22nd. I should have sent it registered, I know. The DA cannot help me. What can I do?\n","answer":" Yeah you would have something to go off of had you sent this certified. It will be very hard to pursue this given that you don't have verifiable proof on your end.

{"question":"I'm currently working a job where they had us \"sign\" a document which said we would be working 4 ten hour days without overtime. Is this a legal thing to do?

I'm not too concerned with my own pay or anything, because I'm working for fun, but I feel like my coworkers are getting screwed over by this, and they get paid little enough as it is.\n","answer":" Your employer can set up a standard work schedule of four 10 hour days instead of five 8 hour days. That doesn't mean you've signed away overtime; you still have to be paid overtime if you work more than 10 hours in a day or more than 40 hours in a week.\n\n&gt;Not only that, I work at least 10 hour days, once a week. My last paycheck(Bimonthly) says I worked only 16 hours, which is complete and utter bullshit.\n\nIf they refuse to pay you for all the hours you work, you can file a wage complaint with the labor commissioner.Answer #2: Entering into an alternative arrangement like 4\/40 or 9\/80 or is legal in CA.  Employees have to agree to it.  A lot of employees love such arrangements -- they get extra days off.\n\nIf your paycheck is wrong and your company refuses to correct it, you can contact [DLSE](http:\/\/www.dir.ca.gov\/dlse\/howtofilewageclaim.htm) and file a complaint.

{"question":"Yesterday I left my ex fiancé. Not going into why. This morning I went into my bank account to change the password (I was changing everything). My checking account was cleared and my saving held just enough to keep it open. I called the bank to put a hold on my account but the employee said that it was too late to get the money back. I have a personal checking and savings and a joint checking with the ex. In my transactions I could see my money was moved from my personal to the joint and from there to the ex's personal savings. Is this considered fraud and identity left or petty theft because I honestly didn't have much in there.\n\n\nI live in the USA.\n","answer":" Is not fraud, its larceny.  And a possible violation of the computer crimes act 1986.   \n\nIf you were the only one on your personal account and he was not a designated signer.  Then he stole the money. Even if you had given him the password in the past(but not a signature card) he still stole the money. He accessed your account with out authorization and transferred the money with malicious intent. \n\nYou need to file a police report and then rephrase to the bank what he did.  Do not use the standard teller they are pretty much useless in this matter,  call and get bank security and fraud department on the phone.  \n\nAlso get an attorney to have his accounts seized(maybe) and go after him civilly until this is resolved or he is arrested. If you wish to pursue this you may get more back than just what he took.\n\n Answer #2: To clarify...\n\nThe money was moved from a checking\/savings (that was just in your name)- and moved to a joint checking\/savings account (in both names).  It was then moved to an account under just their name.\n\n\nIf this is correct (and the original account was solely in your name) then that was identity theft.

Are there consequences for me if I don’t appear?  My neighbor also received a letter to appear as a witness, as he was outside and took me in. Does he HAVE TO appear?  What are the likely consequences for her?  No prior record and she has a public defender. Thank you all. \n","answer":" You are a victim of DV and making excuses for your abuser, like victims do. Plenty of people have severe mental from childhood trauma and don’t break anyone’s arm or throw a glass object at anyone’s face. \n\nI suggest you get some services from an agency which helps victims of domestic violence and put this violent criminal in your rear view mirror. Maybe experiencing some criminal consequences will be her impetus to get some mental health treatment . Or maybe not.  Fuck her. Answer #2: Have you been subpoenaed or just asked? The difference is important, if you have just been asked then you can tell the DA you respectfully decline, at which point you will likely be issued a subpoena which you must comply with. If you have been subpoenaed you must show up and truthfully testify. You can always call the DA and tell them your wishes. They may or may not listen to you."}

{"question":"So today in class we had a vocabulary word which was \"aperture\". My teacher then took his dslr (digital camera) and took a picture of every student to \"show us how an aperture worked\". He also asked a student who he knows does not like him very much if she \"wanted to post for the camera\". Is there anything I can do against him legally since it is very disturbing that he has a picture of me and most of my classmates on his personal camera. During the year he has also made several different alarming gestures towards several of my classmates saying, \"If you dint understand that come after school for some private tutoring\" after a joke he made. Thanks for any help you can give me.\n","answer":" The laws change depending on the state you live in. Generally, ***publishing*** photos taken in a public school for monetary gain other than journalism, would require a signed model release from each person that is identifiable in the photo. \n\nIf the photos your teacher took are not going to be published, then your school district likely has restrictions in place requiring parental consent for photographing a minor on school grounds. Your legal guardian(s) probably signed a media release at the beginning of the school year, deciding if photos taken of you can be used by the school. \n\nSo, before asking \"Is there anything I can do against him legally,\" talk to your administrators and find out the photo and image guidelines that they have implemented. I would also explain this situation to them. The actions your teacher took are creepy and unprofessional. \n\nLegal action may not be the best solution to your problem in this case......"}

I let them know it was a tip and was not stealing but I'm still afraid they will think that I was taking money and file charges. Do I have anything to worry about legally?\n","answer":" No. Tips being the casino's money and not yours is a policy, not a law. Answer #2: What's your job at the casino and where it is located? Can no one there accept tips or just people in certain jobs?\n\nI've worked as a lawyer for casinos I've never heard of this, except rules prohibiting managers from accepting tips. Putting it in with the house money, then putting it in your pocket, then putting it back with the house money, was not very smooth and you shouldn't do that again."}
{"question":"I live in an apartment complex in Raleigh, NC where the units are maintained by the property manager. Just moved in back at the start of August. I noticed an issue with the bathroom toilet a few weeks in where when you flush, the water will continue to run long after and eventually stop after a while. Didnt think much of it for a while until I was finally fed up with the noise it made and reported it to maintenance. Lo and behold, I get a $300 water\/sewer bill for use of 32,000 gallons in 28 days.\n\nI've already paid the bill as I didn't want to be delinquent, and I reported the condition to the property manager to make sure something else wasn't wrong. Maintenance team found nothing else, so it had to have been to extending flushing issue I had the first few weeks.\n\nMy question is: do I have any hope of getting the property manager to help with this water bill cost, as the maintenance issue wasn't really my fault? Or am I just boned?\n","answer":" Unlikely, as you noticed a problem and failed to report it in a timely manner. Answer #2: That's a hundred and twenty thousand litres, for everyone else.\n\nUsing a no-calculator value of 13 litres per flush, I make that OVER NINE THOUSAND flushes in a short month. That's not an \"extended flushing issue\" so much as \"a toilet pissing nearly four tons of water a day down the line\". I'd love to live in a place where that'd only cost me $300.\n\nI'd think that kind of defect in a fixture is definitely the sort of thing management should be compensating you for.\n\nAnswer #3: You can call the utility company and they can reduce the bill in cases like this. Ask for a leak adjustment. Get a receipt from the plumber when they come to show that a problem was fixed. That is pretty cheap for that amount of water though.

This may be state specific, but I know where I've lived before it's totally illegal to offer a rent-to-own on a house that you don't own outright (to prevent exactly this scenario). \n\nCould criminal charges be brought against the landlord if this rent-to-own was illegal to begin with? Would a criminal charge of some kind be helpful to a tenant pursuing damages in this situation? This is very sad to me- rent-to-owns are cool in theory, but are so often used as a way to take advantage of people who cannot secure a traditional mortgage and have dreams of home ownership. So sorry for your friend. Answer #2: The tenant's remedy is to sue the landlord on the contract."}

{"question":"They're clearly over the weight limit by a large margin and the leasing office is definitely aware of the animals. We want to move anyway, is this enough to break the lease? \n","answer":" I don't think another lessor violating a pet weight limit would be enough grounds for you to break your lease, that doesn't really affect you, especially if the landlord okay'd it.\n\nThe barking could be an issue, but if they just moved in, you'll need to make complaints to the landlord, and have a paper trail. You can't just say the dogs were barking one night and expect to be let out of your lease.\n\nStart documenting the dog barking, make complaints, and try to figure out with your roommates if they can stop it. If you really want to move, you should just pony up and pay the termination fee, because it seems like your grasping at straws to get out of your lease agreement without penalty.Answer #2: To specify, it's not technically student housing, it's a private apartment complex. We have a tiny dog that we really aren't comfortable having around these dogs. When I asked about terminating our lease yesterday they told us that we would have to sublease our rooms, and they would prioritise renting out every other room in the  complex before renting ours if we left. It's a separate lease for each bedroom so we have 0 control over who moves in, they literally gave us 2 hours notice before he moved in (their policies say they give multiple days notice, workers in the office wanted their commission and he needed to move in that day though.) I can't imagine each room in this 4br is allocated 2 pets either. Our leases each have around $3,000 left on them (359 a month), would it even be feasible for them to sue over that amount, when they definitely won't be vacant for the remaining 8 months anyway? "}

It looks like 30 days notice is necessary in your location, and on the 31st day you can go to court and file an eviction. You cannot change locks or remove his things in the mean time.Answer #3: Since nobody else has mentioned: It is very common in this kind of situation to offer a cash for keys deal where you pay them to move out. Usually the payment is 1 or 2 months rent. This is the fastest and least painful solution for you and might even be the cheapest considering your other option might be hotels."}

{"question":"So, a few months ago I got a letter from Comcast saying I was illegally downloading Dallas Buyer's Club (I was) and that if I wanted to contact an attorney about it that I should. I did, and the attorney told me write them and deal with it (not for free, clearly). Got a letter today, and Comcast is allowing me (HA!) to settle for 3.9k in damages. WTF!?

You are facing serious charges and I'd suggest you get a lawyer to help you in court. You may think these charges are trivial, but imagine an unlicensed driver running their car into a ditch, they'd still be charged the same.Answer #2: I am not a lawyer, but it looks like TN recognizes out of state learner's permits.

{"question":"Edit: Thanks everybody -- the pastor came through! He found the license we gave him in June. He promised to hand-deliver it to the Clerk. \n\nI'm replacing the bulk of the post with this edit, so the tl;dr of the post is that our marriage license was never filed by our officiant, which seemed to mean we'd need to get a new marriage license and hence our \"legal\" wedding date wouldn't match our \"real\" wedding date, which bothered us for a number of reasons. However, after I posted, our officiant found the original marriage license, and this means my wife and I will have our wedding \"count\" after all.\n","answer":" What are these \"papers\"? Can they just not be reproduced? You got them from the courthouse right? \n\n&gt; Getting a new marriage would mean that we would be married after the conception of our child rather than before \n\nNo it wouldn't. You made your public and faith commitment before conception.  The child is not a bastard.  Besides the classic definition of that term is when the child is born to unwed parents not conceived.Answer #2: Your issue is that your marriage license wasn't recorded. \nIt looks like your pastor is guilty of a misdemeanor for not returning the license. https:\/\/theamm.org\/marriage-laws\/alabama\/\n\nRecording the license doesn't seem an element to a marriage in Alabama, but you might have to petition a court to fix the record. \nAnswer #3: I'm not to sure about the rest of it, but I feel it is important to point out your legal wedding date only matters on legal documents. Everywhere else using your church wedding date is perfectly okay. A couple I know has the reversed situation. For personal reasons they were legally married about 6 months before their actually wedding ceremony.

Yes, if the police decide to investigate this, it is likely that they will contact your parents. Because when you do stupid things like convince strangers that you're sexually abusing children as a joke, they're not going to belive you when you say, \"nevermind, just kidding, I'm just an idiot teenager,\" after they've contacted police.  And if you've made yourself look credible as someone who is breaking the laws or actually broken laws in this endeavor, law enforcement may have to investigate, and because you are a child, that would involve contact with your parents."}

{"question":"To make a long story short, the state of NJ appointed an administrator\/attorney for my grandmother's estate when she passed in Feb of 2015. The attorney submitted the Final Accounting to the court on Jan 26, 2017.

That paperwork submitted with the Final Accounting indicated each of the 3 beneficiaries were to receive $141k from the estate.  It's now 3 months later, and I JUST received the Refund and Release Bond, which I signed, notarized and returned to the attorney overnight (I was charged for this out of my portion of the distribution).

{"question":"I was reading \/r\/IDontWorkHereLady and one of the stories ended with the police asking a guy if he wanted to press charges against a random woman that attacked him in a store. \n\nBut that got me thinking... if a crime was committed and that person was arrested and the DA is prosecuting him\/her, why would the arresting officer ask someone involved in the crime if \\*they\\* want to \\*press charges\\* ?? Is it just a figure of speech? Are they asking for cooperation in the investigation\/trial?\n\nBTW, I live in USA but I think this phrase may also be used in Europe, Canada, etc. \n\nI've never been asked that by the police. Once though in high school my neighbor called the police on me \\(its a long story  but I can explain in the comments if you're interested\\) and they asked him that question, or so I was told, and he apparently said no. Hard to even say if a crime was committed in the first place though.\n","answer":" It means: \"If we go to the time and trouble and spend scarce resources prosecuting, will you assist?  Will you make yourself available for interviews, and meetings, and show up to testify, without causing us additional headaches?  If we ask you to get an examination of some kind done, will you do it?  Will you turn over any documents or electronic devices we need for examination?  In short, are you willing to put in the time and effort necessary to see a prosecution through?\"Answer #2: It's a fairly common courtesy for the cops to ask whether the victim is interested in seeing charges pressed before they escalate to the DA's office. If nothing else, it saves the DA time dealing with victims and witnesses who don't want to cooperate. They might not go with the victim's decision, but they _can_."}

{"question":"Okay so in my health class we are currently having an anti-drug lesson where we do assignments based on videos and small pamphlets. Me not agreeing with the choice to teach students anti-drug propaganda, and should teach safe use instead of prohibition decided to look into it more. Well the pamphlets and videos are a direct funding of the church of Scientology, wanting students to know the real truth about drugs and for church and state to not be integrated, especially one like Scientology so controversial.

{"question":"I know a lot of exotic animals are illegal to own without a license in CA, does anyone know if ducks fall into this category?\n","answer":" Yes, ducks are legal.\n\nAt least I hope so, considering I have one at home.\n\nThey aren't viewed any differently than chickens, as far as I understand.Answer #2: We got ours from a person selling them out of the bed of their pickup, in the parking lot of a tire shop.\n\nI suspect that's not normal.Answer #3: Ducks in general are legal to keep as pets, but some metro areas may prohibit them under local zoning restrictions on agriculture.  For example, you can't keep fowl in Beverly Hills.  Answer #4: Probably depends on the breed. I am sure there exists some endangered ones somewhere that would be bsnned.Answer #5: IANAL, but I’m an ACO in CA. Ducks are considered Fowl, and will be under your cities fowl restrictions. You need to look up the code for your city and first see if you’re allowed to own fowl. If you are there are likely distance requirements and numbers requirements associated with them."}

{"question":"Hi I posted a few weeks ago about a church that cut down my trees. I got a surveyor out and there are 2 trees on my property. 3 or 4 of the other stumps are either touching the line or a few inches over the line onto my property. Does anyone know if I can claim the ones that are touching or strattling the property line? I'm going to try to get an arborist to appraise them but I don't know if they should do all of them or just the ones on my side. \n\nAlso the surveyor found that part of the fence that the church built encroaches my property by about 5 feet. Lol.\n","answer":" That seems like it's likely to be over the small claims limit. I would recommend talking to a real estate attorney and having them draft a letter to the church explaining what has happened that's wrong and what you want to have it fixed.

Don't know what TX says, but \"boundary tree\" is the phrase you're probably looking for.Answer #3: Have you tried contacting the Texas State Bar to get a referral for a lawyer who would specialize in this?Answer #4: Absolutely defer to a proper tree law expert, but you should only expect anything to come of the trees whose centers were on your side of the line.

(For instance they are not going to be able to take her to court and get a court order that she has to pay.)  \n\nBut they can deny her service as long as they aren't denying based on a protected class (race, gender, etc...)\n\nUsually they will do this if the address has unpaid bills to stop people from getting service at the address and when it gets canceled for non-payment trying to put it into another person's name.\n\nI would call back again and ask to speak with a retention agent.

{"question":"Vermont \n\nHi all, thank you in advance for your help. \n\nLong story short. A woman and I are about to determine custody of a 1.5 year old in Vermont. It is a complicated situation, but the bottom line is that I would like Zero custody or visitation rights. I would like her to have sole custody. I think this is sincerely best for the child and the adults in this situation. I understand that I will owe child support and that is perfectly ok. \n\nInitially she was on-board with the idea of me giving up parental rights, but she has change her tune lately and wants me to have some form of joint custody and seeing the child on the weekends. Can a judge force me to have custody?  Can a judge force me to have a relationship with this child?\n\nI sincerely appreciate your help. I was waiting on a call back from a lawyer, but they must have gotten tied up. :(\n","answer":" No, a judge can't force you to have a relationship with the child. Answer #2: Not having custody (now more commonly called parenting time) is not the same thing as giving up parental rights.  \n\nNot having any parenting time is relatively easy.  Just tell the judge you don't want any.  Terminating your rights is quite difficult unless there is a stepparent ready to adopt.\n\nRetaining parental rights means, for example, that if the mother is in an accident and temporarily unconscious, you would be legally responsible for the child.  You will also remain responsible for child support."}

The police do not and have not considered me a suspect or person of interest. The mother keeps posting all over Facebook\/Twitter\/etc. that I'm responsible for \"taking her baby away\". I've asked the sites to take those posts down but they refuse.\n\nWhat can I do?\n","answer":" If you're absolutely positive you didn't abduct a child, have an attorney write a cease and desist. \n \nIf you did abduct a child, I would consult with a criminal defense attorney. Answer #2: I don't think anyone has yet treated your situation with the gravity it deserves. This IS libel. Period. Nobody has said that to you yet and it does need to be said. You are a private citizen, you did not abduct a child and the accusation that you have done so is harmful to your reputation. You can file suit against her and would most likely win. I feel awful that her child was abducted, but her actions are inexcusable and also evil. Sure, nobody might be taking her seriously, but would a future employer (for example) feel the same way? Answer #3: Usually for defamation actions, one of the elements you have to show is that it caused damages, such as you losing business because your reputation was hurt.\n\nHowever, in Florida (and most jurisdictions), there is defamation per se.  Certain types of statements don't require you to show damages to get relief from the court.  One of the classic defamation per say types is accusations of criminal conduct.Answer #4: Fl lawyer here.

Self-help Forms can be found here. \n\nWww.Flcourts.orgAnswer #5: If this woman is mentally ill and blames you for her daughter's disappearance, you may have reason to fear for the safety of your children.

I told him I couldn't afford that and would not be renewing. He told me that if I don't sign the renewal at the increased rate by tonight, Oct. 27th, he will be terminating my lease Dec. 1st, meaning I need to move out by Nov. 31st.

The country my pee is in,  the country I peed from , or both?\n\n\\(Public urination is a misdemeanor in both CZ Republic and Germany\\)\n\nAlso, similar to this, if you were to yell insults at  someone across an international border,  or even shoot someone across a border, does it work the same way, or is  it different \\(I swear, just curious\\).\n","answer":" You could be prosecuted for public urination in both countries.\n\nFun fact: the concept of “double jeopardy” doesn’t apply when dealing with separate sovereigns.\n\nNote: I haven’t read the urination laws of either country. Just using the chance to point out that a single act can be prosecuted more than once if the act is considered a crime by separate sovereigns and those sovereigns both consider themselves to have jurisdiction.\n\nIn the US, states are considered separate sovereigns relative to the federal government, and its fairly common for a single act to be prosecuted at a state and a federal level. Since they are separate sovereigns, this isn’t “double jeopardy”."}

It'd be different in other scenarios (e.g. regarding following employee manuals, safety guidelines, etc) but in this case, no nothing really illegal about it especially if it's in a joking manner.Answer #2: Perfectly legal.

{"question":"In mid-November, I (Wisconsin resident) drove through the Illinois tollway on the way to the airport.  I decided to pay the fees online after getting home from my trip, within the 7-day grace period they give.  I went on to the website and had some trouble navigating it, so I called the number they gave to ask for help.  While on the phone with them, I answered their questions and they informed me I had no tolls to pay.  I was pretty surprised and insisted I had some, but they told me there were none.\n\nA few days ago, I received a letter informing me that I had three unpaid tolls, and they were charging me a $20 late fee for each one, a total of $60.  I called them up to explain I tried to pay them on time, and was told there weren't any.  The person I was speaking to said that the person I called originally shouldn't have said that, but I'm still liable for the fees.  Is there anything I can do, or would it be worth talking to a lawyer?\nTopic:\nTraffic and Parking\n","answer":" My personal, non lawyer advice is to keep escalating it because it's a support issue.  It's unfortunate if you didn't retain any proof from the original conversation (I prefer to deal with support in emails or online chat whenever possible for this reason).  At least document the time and who you're speaking to.  Make it a point to request it added to case notes if that's something they keep.\n\nI can't see it being worth a lawyer over $60.  At the least, you could attempt to negotiate with a supervisor to pay only the amount you would originally owe and waive the late fees.  But squeaky wheel &gt; grease etc."}

{"question":"I've spent some time searching and can only find the generic response of \"contact your lawyer\". The testator was sick at the time and in a serious state of confusion at the time of making amendments to his will. \n\nThe testator does not remember where he was during the time of changing his will. The family members that were present will not release any of these details to another family member, WHO IS ON THE WILL. The testator and the family member that is on the will, both need to obtain a copy of this will. \n\nDo they need to call the county court?

If we have any more trouble with this situation, I won't hesitate to ask. I really appreciate everything.\n","answer":" If the testator doesn't have his will, and doesn't know where it is, and is still competent to sign a will, the simplest suggestion is for him to write a new will which will supersede and revoke any prior will that still may be in existence somewhere. Answer #2: Although it's not uncommon to file a Will with the court clerk, it's not super common either. You could try doing records searches at the courthouses near where you think the will was drafted, but I'd guess that's pretty unlikely to result in anything. \n\nA better option would be to draft a new will (assuming the Testator is still competent). Depending on the complexity of the asset management plan, you can generally have something prepared for a few hundred dollars. Although I definitely recommend having an attorney draft the will (trust me, they're much much more complex than you think they are), if there's a time crunch or if you simply cannot afford to pay an attorney, the Testator can draft a [Holographic Will (wikipedia cite. lol.)](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Holographic_will).\n\nIf you choose to go the holographic route, be very sure to read that entire article very closely, especially the sections on the various laws relating to holographic wills in different US states (you might also consider updating with your state so that I can check the state law)."}

Right after, my neighbor started beating my dog in the eye saying how worthless etc he was and that I was not getting away as my\nDog gave him a gash \/ broke his glasses. Can I have the police arrested him?\n\nTexas\n","answer":" Call the police. Sue your neighbor for the vet bills.Answer #2: NAL, but beating the dog after the threat was over (punitively) isn't self-defense, it's animal cruelty. If you have a K9 officer in your area, try calling them out to file a report, regular cops are hit or miss when it comes to animal cruelty matters. You're probably still on the hook for this person's medical bills and expenses though.Answer #3: I'd say you are liable for his medical bills and glasses.\n\nHe is liable for any vet bills for you dog.\n\nThe police would come and take a report, they would very likely not just go and arrest your neighbor based on your version of events.Answer #4: Call police, sue neighbor for vet bills (may be able to do this in small claims court depending on amount of bills). You will likely be liable for his glasses and medical bills as well. IANALAnswer #5: As unintentional as it sounds, you opening your door and allowing your dog to run out caused injury to another person.  That is the same as leaving a back gate open.  You’ll be responsible for any injuries caused as a result of your animal not being under control.   You can try to have him charged, but I don’t think the police are going to do much, because he’ll say he was fearful and jacked with adrenaline, and was confused after taking a hit to the head while falling down the stairs.  Your best bet to recover vet bills is small claims, but again, you’re going to be paying for his glasses and any medical treatment for his injuries."}

If progressive says I'm 10-20% at fault, do i accept that payment and sue them for the rest, or should I not accept anything and sue the driver?  All  inputs appreciated. - Portland Oregon\n","answer":" You cannot accept settlement from their insurance and then sue the driver for more as their insurance will require you to sign a release of liability prohibiting you from doing so. So you have to choose between the two. Either take whatever settlement they offer or decline it and sue the driver. Other option is to go thru your own insurance if you carry collision on your car.

If they want to fire you, make them actually do it. Answer #2: IANAL, but I believe that if you've worked there for at least a year and average like 25 hours a week you qualify for FMLA whether they call you full-time or not, assuming they're a big enough company, etc.Answer #3: As others have said, you don't qualify for FMLA. But, don't quit, get fired, and file a complaint with your labor investigating agency. There's always the possibility they find something else and it sounds like your employer likes to straddle the line on legality. It's worth a shot unless you want a recommendation. \n\nIn general, document everything. Have them write you a letter confirming they won't approve your time off.

Now they are refusing to make any payments on the debt. \n\nThe company is in a lot of debt (way more than just this card, and more debt than income).

Do I have a leg to stand on? I feel like my only chance is something relating to how they are paying off the debt, but I'm unsure. What action can I take? \n","answer":" Pay off the card yourself because it is in your name and delaying that will affect your credit.\n\nSue the company for the amount your owed.  If you get a judgement, then you can take action to collect (like acquiring their assets until the amount is paid).\n\nThat company's financial situation is not your responsibility.

You also have to meet certain statutory exemptions under the FLSA (state law may also apply, but idk about MO). If you don't qualify as exempt, your boss has to pay you an overtime premium rate (there is more than way to accomplish this though). For example, if you make at least $455 per week and perform primarily managerial duties, you might be exempt (there are also a number of things your employer has to do to keep that exemption, for example, there are restrictions on the ability to dock your pay). I'm not your lawyer, but if you're concerned, you might start by calling the Department of Labor Wage &amp; Hour Division. You could ask your boss about it, but that might cause more conflict than you want to deal with. TL;DR it's kind of a complicated question and you might want to talk to the DOL or an attorney. "}

{"question":"We’re a small BBQ restaurant in Shoreline WA getting ready to open end of the month. Today we were having our main piece of equipment delivered- $20k smoker. Took 2 months to build, this was the unit that would get us open.\n\nThen the freight delivery driver dropped it 4 feet off of the lift gate, onto its back. We watched it happen.\n\nDriver was trying to unload the 1005 pound unit by himself.\n\nSo, we obviously refused delivery. Called UPS and the manufacturer, told them what happened. Took pictures.\n\nHere’s the thing - these units take 2 months to build. We picked this because it’s one of two smokers on the market that fit our kitchen.\n\nNow, UPS is taking it back, Southern Pride has to start over, and we can’t open our business until it gets replaced.\nCan we go after UPS for loss of earnings?

{"question":"Today at work we had a emotional support animal come in, my nurse manager refused to comply since the paperwork was from an online psychologist. I'm in Virginia and it seems to be the unwritten law that the pay for papers ESA don't count. Any truth in that?\n","answer":" Comply with what?  Is this a housing issue?  Did someone bring an animal to work?  Was this a patient at a hospital?  Need more context.Answer #2: Was this a hospital and was this dog trying to visit somebody? The hospital doesn't have to allow that for any ESA.Answer #3: Online papers are 100% fake, there is no registry, no certification. Also, ESA’s have no right to be in public spaces, but these online registry’s advertise full access for whatever cost for a fake paper. The scam is hurting businesses and taking advantage of people who do not want to get in trouble for violating the ADA so they just allow it. Worked in a restaurant and had so many people bringing in ESA’s, putting them on tables, chairs, etc and would get completely irate when you’d ask them to take their pet outside and argue about how they’re pets were allowed anywhere because the website they paid said so. ESA’s require a prescription from their therapist. Service dogs are not required to have any identification or papers, but you can legally ask if it is a Service dog- and what tasks it is trained to preform. Answer #4: Where do you work?

{"question":"In our lease, it says that no animals are allowed, however there was a verbal agreement between us and him where we were allowed to have my girlfriends parents dogs over for a weekend every now and then. The other day we had them out to use the restroom, when he text my girlfriend that we needed to find a new place to live, because dogs weren't allowed and that we needed to cut our grass. Needless to say we were surprised. Now, we have seen other people with dogs around here, and most of our neighbors grass is just as tall as ours is.  If I'm not mistaken though, doesn't he have to give us a formal written eviction notice obtained from a court? Not just that, but we have already paid rent for this month, so doesn't he at least have to give us through this rent period to get out? I'm a little confused as to what my rights are at this moment, and if it helps,  I live in arkansas. I appreciate any and all help you guys can give. \n","answer":" Let's not go to war just yet.  Perhaps what landlord was saying was that he is no longer willing to accommodate the dogs, and is not giving you formal notice to quit, but rather is taking the more reasonable approach of letting you know it's time to start looking for somewhere new to live.  Perhaps he anticipates you will find a place where the lease allows dogs, and give him appropriate notice to end your tenancy.  \n\nIf you have a lease, you're entitled to stay until the end of the lease, but may be required to remove the dogs and to cut the grass (if lawn care is your responsibility under the lease).  If you're in a month-to-month tenancy, landlord can give you notice to quit with appropriate notice at any time.  Such notice likely needs to be in writing.Answer #2: That doesn't cut it for written notice if he's kicking you out for breaking your lease.   But if your lease says no dogs then you can be kicked out for having a dog.Answer #3: &gt;however there was a verbal agreement between us and him where we were allowed to have my girlfriends parents dogs over for a weekend every now and then\n\nIn future, get any amendments to the lease such as this written in as a clause, otherwise you're just opening yourself up to this kind of thing happening.Answer #4: Do you have a written lease?

This whole situation has been very chaotic and shitty, and I want to know whether I am entitled to getting my stuff back or if I really have to pay her back for everything. \n","answer":" Your best bet is to find somewhere else to live ASAP. While it's technically true that she can't just kick you out suddenly (she's supposed to give you 15 days notice), the law isn't going to be much help if she does it anyway.

Should she collect evidence or leave it to the card company? \n\nLocated in Texas.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, his mom is going to pay the debts. Not sure if this changes any advice.\n\nThis may be a post for \/r\/personalfinance\n","answer":" Police report for fraud, fraud alert on credit file, dispute credit entries with police report.\n\nThat's if she doesn't want to pay it.\n\nAlternately, pay them all off and seek relationship counseling.\n\nImportant point: a boyfriend who takes out four credit cards in your name is not a good boyfriend and does not represent a \"loss\" when one kicks him to the curb.Answer #2: She has two options only. She can start the fraud process by filing a police report, or she can accept the debt she owes to the credit card companies and sue him on her own if she wants to. There is no option which gets the debt out of her name without involving the police and likely criminal charges.  "}

{"question":"This question arguably contains spoilers for *Dial M For Murder*\n\nWhen Grace Kelly's character is on death row, Ray Milland is urged to confess to conspiring to murder her to clear her name. But what I don't understand is why anyone would ever think he would agree to the scheme, because he'd just be put in her place instead. But in the movie, he's told he'd probably only get a couple years if they bought his story, as opposed to death row for her. So, why is it that successfully killing someone is punished more harshly than failing at it?\n","answer":" Well for one thing, you don't want an attempted murderer to be in this position: \"I'm already going to get the death penalty for the attempt, might as well finish the job.\"Answer #2: Every crime has two necessary elements, a mental element (the mens rea) which is essentially the intent to commit the crime and then the physical act of committing the crime (the actus reus). Murder and attempted murder have the same mens rea but different actus reus, this it is appropriate they have different sentences. If the were to have same sentence it would have the effect of making attempted murder a sort of thought crime which is not something a fair and just criminal justice system should have.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that in most jurisdictions the penalty for attempted murder is very high."}

{"question":"Hey guys. Was just handed a summons by two cops at my place. It's against me and my ex-girlfriend, who lives 5 states away. We recently broke up and fought, but nothing I thought would result in this. I don't believe I did anything illegal. Reading this three paged document, it says I can request to be permitted to testify or to give my deposition by telephone, which I'd ideally prefer to do. I know nearly nothing about law, so I guess I'm just confused what this is all about and what my ex wants.

{"question":"Hello,\n\nMy wife works in a Methadone clinic (Ontario, Canada) in which she handles administrative aspects of the clinic.  She is an administrative worker and doesn't hold a nursing licence.  She was informed today the nurse who handles methadone dosage is leaving early leaving her alone in the clinic (this alone scares the crap out of me) it has been implied that she should handle the this.  I recommended that she just close the clinic.  My questions are:\n\n1. Legally what issues could she face if she tries to dose patients?  I don't think that she will do this but I think it's important to know.\n\n2. Would she be protected from repercussions if she closed the clinic? \n\n3. Finally is there anyone that should be contacted regarding this?\n\nThanks for your help \n","answer":" The word \"implied\" is tricky here - she could be imagining she was ordered to dispense, or it could be an actual order but veiled.\n\nIf she did dispense a controlled a controlled substance without the proper authorization, she could be facing criminal charges. \n\nShe should not close the clinic on her own unless she does have the authority to do that, because otherwise just that is worthy of discipline. Instead, tell those in charge that without someone licensed to dispense, closing would be the best course of action.  If they want to order her to dispense, they need to make that explicit and she should also explicitly refuse.\n\nThere could repercussions for this, e.g. she is fired or disciplined. But firing someone for refusing to commit a serious criminal offense is just begging to be sued for wrongful dismissal. The courts don't take kindly on that.\n\nIf she is ordered to dispense methadone, she can complain to whoever regulates your clinic: the college of physicians if a doctor is in charge, the college of pharmacists if a pharmacist is, Health Canada, and your local health regionAnswer #2: There are a bunch of situations in the law where the penalties fall firmly on the individuals.  For instance, if your boss orders you to serve more alcohol to drunk people or to underage people, and you do so, the penalty falls on you, not the boss.\n\nDo not break the law, even if that is inconvenient for co-workers or anyone else.\n\nIf I were her, I would find a way to refer patients to the next-closest clinic."}

I called police,  they stated it was a civil matter.    Is there any legal way I can get rid of him??     Should I start the process of eviction on him?     At this point im going to try and find another place to live.  But until then I dont feel comfortable in my own home.   I pay all the utilities.  \n\nThanks in advance\n","answer":" Are you renting the entire house, or just the main living area? What does your lease say?\n\nSince you're a month to month tenant, the landlord could just terminate your tenancy and make you move out, just FYI."}
{"question":"My parents, while I was away at college, used my information to get a CenturyLink account. The account is now in collections for over $450, and it happened in May of 2015. I was in a dorm, 3 hours away, I've never had an account with them myself. So, what can I do to not pay this debt and not have it on my credit report?\n","answer":" Make a report with the police and tell century linkAnswer #2: OP have you pulled your credit report yet? You should check it to see if there are any other emtries you do not recognize and then freeze your account. Set the challenge questions to things your parents cannot guess.\n\nYou need to decide whether you file a police report and get out of the debt or accept it as your own. There are no middle grounds."}
{"question":"Colleague of mine in Colorado is having PC problems and called a remote technician to come to his home. Tech said it'll be $125 to diagnose whatever is causing his computer to not start up. My friend is having second thoughts, but tech said they require 24 hours notice to cancel an appointment, despite the fact that them showing up in the morning will be less than 24 hours from when my friend called.\n\nHe's having second thoughts since what he thinks is the problem will cost about $200 to replace a part anyway, but he feels he stuck and can't cancel the appointment. Reviews online say this company is pretty liberal about taking people to collections for non-payment. But if he refuses to let the guy in the door in the first place, does he have any recourse?\n\nEverything is verbal so far, he hasn't signed any agreement that I'm aware of.\n","answer":" &gt; Can you refuse entry to a repair person you've called to avoid paying?\r\n\nNope. The late cancellation charge is not for the service; it's to compensate the business for loss of the opportunity to fill that hole in its schedule and generate revenue. That doesn't change by closing the door.Answer #2: If your colleague fails to let the repair person in, or isn't home, then the company has the right to charge the fee.  \n\nAnswer #3: He doesn't have to let the person in his home but that won't stop them from charging him or sending him to collections if he doesn't pay."}
{"question":"I don't want to, but after spending thousands on personals the past few years, I am so alone. I don't know how, why, or what it is, but no women are interested in me. I would pay someone to just hold me a few minutes and tell me life is going to be okay....\n\nIs that prostitution in the US or is that legal? How much should I offer?\n","answer":" If you pay a woman to be with you, you know the interest is not genuine. It won't make you happy. You need to be happy with yourself before anyone will be interested in you. Unless you find one of those women who like damaged men to fix. For general companionship, get a dog.\n\nFind a group that interests you. Meet people who enjoy the same interests. Things blossom from there. Even horribly unattractive people find dates; there really is someone for everyone. \n\nThat said, prostitution is sexual. Companionship is not. \"Companion\" is actually a service provided by medicaid for disabled people to go into the community, its paying someone to basically be your friend- not illegal. Anyway, go on craigslist. Professional cuddling is a thing now. They charge like $15 an hour or something to cuddle you. Or even better, a therapist."}
{"question":"While I was changing my last name after I got married, I asked to have my middle name completely removed (no given middle name or maiden name as middle name, just FirstName LastName). The clerk kept asking me if I was sure and I said \"yes.\" My card came in the mail today with my given middle name on it. I called the SS office to ask about having it removed and was told I need a court order saying it is removed, and since I was given a middle name at birth, I must always have a middle name. Is this correct? Why can I change my middle and last names due to marriage and not remove it?\n","answer":" Yes that is correct. You have to have a court order to drop it. "}
{"question":"Disclaimer: Not doing this, have no plans of doing this, but I'm very much of the opinion it wouldn't be technically illegal. My SO thinks it would mean the baby has underage possession, but that's illegal for the baby (technically) not for me.

{"question":"Hi, I'm posting this for my friend. Basically the situation is this: we're part of a group of people who were looking for housing. We finally found a four bedroom house, and intend to sign the lease in the next week. However, my friend's parents (who pay part of his rent) are opposed to the idea of all four people on one lease because they think they'll be liable for the full amount in the case that everyone backs out. My question is this: what are the options in case people do back out? What protections are there for people who share a lease? \n","answer":" &gt;What protections are there for people who share a lease?\n\nNot really any protections.  In most situations when you all sign a lease together you are jointly and severally liable for all charges.  So the fear of one co-tenant or guarantor of a co-tenant that they might end up on the hook for everything is well founded.  \n\nA tenant injured by his co-tenants can often sue his co-tenants for damages.  But is in most situations individually liable to the landlord for anything up to all charges incurred under the lease and would have to pay the landlord and then recover from his co-tenants (if possible) separately.

I ended up taking about $150 from the till at my store bit replaced it 3 days later but they ended up seeing me take it on cameras. How do I go about this situation?\n","answer":" You speak to a criminal defence attorney, and to nobody else. You may be facing theft charges and a criminal record.Answer #2: Returning money doesn't undo the original theft. If the police want to talk to you, don't say anything without a lawyer. If you just get fired and they don't involve the police, consider yourself lucky."}

Clearly, I can speak orally, but can I distribute fliers, tape posters to walls, chalk messages on the sidewalk, etc?\n","answer":" You can't deface public property under the guise of free speech. Chalk, tape, things that cost money to clean or remove, are a grey area.

I did not file for the insurance since it would have charged the drunk driver in voilation of his parole and seperate him from his kid.

{"question":"We live in the Atlanta, GA area, and my wife's Doctor is refusing to give her a copy of her medical records. When she was leaving her appointment today he refused to give them to her, and said he'd only be sending them to her new doctor. When I went up their with signed and notorized documents where she requested he release them to me, he told me he would call the cops if I didn't leave his office immediately. Is this legal?\n","answer":" Except under certain circumstances, a person cannot be refused a copy of their records. They can charge a reasonable fee for copying. If they are unwilling to do so, your recourse is to file a complaint with HHS: http:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/hipaa\/filing-a-complaint\/index.html\n\nOf note, they don't have to do it RIGHT THIS SECOND! They have 30 days to provide a copy. Answer #2: Be advised that if the doctor is a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health physician there may be more specific rules for releasing those records which can include \"not at all.\"Answer #3: When you go to the new doctor, sign the release form for the old doctor to release the record to the new doctor. I would also put in a written request to the previous doctor's records department requesting a copy for yourselves. \n\nThe old doctor can't give you the original record (they have to keep your record -whether paper or digital- on file for x amount of years before they can dispose of it), and that's why it takes them a little while to get you a copy... they have to copy or print each page (omitting their personal notes). Larger files will take more time... there will also (most likely) be a copying fee."}

What should I do?\nIf the police are on their way, how long do I have before they knock on my door with a warrant for seizure?\n","answer":" Stop posting nude pictures of yourself online.

I was so angry I call d and reversed the charge. I am going to contest by mail as I was out of state. Anything to worry about or something I should be aware of?\n","answer":" If you cannot reverse the charge back, you should get a lawyer ASAP to handle the inevitable warrant.\n\nExpect said lawyer to not take a credit card.Answer #2: Congratulations! You may well be the stupidest poster ever in the history of this subreddit.  That's really saying something. Your prize includes, but is not limited to a one-way return trip to jail.Answer #3: So, to recap:\n\n1. You paid your bail by credit card. Directly to the county? To a bondsman?\n\n2. You were released on that bond.\n\n3. You reversed the charges.\n\nIf you paid the state, your bail is conditional on the state holding your bond. By failing to pay your bond, you have effectively refused bail. A warrant will be issued for your arrest once the payment is actually reversed, and you may be ineligible for bail once you're re-arrested.\n\nIf you paid a bondsman, then your bail bond is still intact, but the bondsman is going to sue you (and win) for the amount you owe for their services.\n\nCall your credit card issuer and explain that you made a mistake, and that you recognize the charge after all and don't want it reversed.Answer #4: You won't win. And you may very well be charged with fraud. You will drop the whole thing if you have one single molecule of sense in you."}

This could get dangerous and result in injuries (I've been stabbed before minding my own business there) and possible false accusations from homeless people to police. Any for sure precautions I should take?\nTopic:\nPersonal Injury\n","answer":" Crisis. That's how you spell that word. \n\nAre you positive you're a journalist? To call Portland chinatown \"really ghetto\" is obviously just horribly insensitive (and suggests you've never been there.. lol) and not the type of description that suggests any level of professionalism on your part. \n\nI don't think you should do this based on the way you talk about the project.

{"question":"Are they allowed to do this? They put them in the actual shared office space and in the breakroom. They admitted to using the footage in the past to see who was going out the back door.

{"question":"So this is my second day training at work as a night auditor, and the guy who was on shift before me who we will call John is very concerned about the audio recording feature of the new cameras. So concerned that he posted a petition to remove or stop the audio recording feature saying it was against the law and adding several law citations. NH statue 570 concerning wiretapping. We work in New Hampshire for reference. They never had us sign anything regarding this, let alone the guests aren't informed that we record audio. \n\nSo, during his shift, John was talked to by both the manager and the owner telling him to tear up the petition. John, rather, during his shift had put towels over the cameras. At the end of his shift he had me count both cash boxes and check the contents of his car as a witness that he wasn't stealing.  He is convinced he will be fired tomorrow.  I don't want to lose this job but at the same time I want what is right for John. \n","answer":" None of you have an expectation of privacy in a public space, so no wiretapping (also known as eavesdropping) has occurred. They may film with audio in their own place of business. \n\nJohn is so fired tomorrow. At least he went out with a towel-covering-the-camera bang. Answer #2: Totally legal on your companies part, but seriously a towel isnt going to muffle the audio recording much if they are a newer model cameras. He's a dumbass."}

{"question":"I am in the US and located in the state of Texas. Current drinking laws make it illegal to consume or posses alcohol to anyone under the age of 21 unless the minor was in visible site of a parent, spouse, or guardian. A Minor in Possession charge is issued to the minor for walking home intoxicated. Can the minor fight the case by stating there were legal ways for him to be intoxicated? (Such as he got drunk with his parents and he walked home). If so, is he required in court to show proof he was with his parents when he was drinking (such as a testimony from either parent), or is the fact that there was a legal way for him to be drinking enough to get off of the charge?\nI am asking for pure curiosity.

{"question":"So I was reading about the case where a girl (then 17) allegedly \"convinced\" her then boyfriend to commit suicide. The girl is now 21 and this got me to thinking: if she was underage when the crime was committed but she is now clearly of legal age, how is she tried? As a minor? As an adult? I know that we sometimes hear of minors being charged as adults but I assume that their trials are over and done with before they turn 18.

No one has ever told me that was a problem until now. I'm living with friends and cannot get a job without an ID as well. No one can legally hire me. Help! Any advice appreciated!\n","answer":" Is your full last name listed on your birth certificate? There's a great website called [VitalChek](https:\/\/www.vitalchek.com\/) that is a widely-used online resource for getting copies of your birth certificate. I think there may be a few cases where your certificate may not be found but that would only be if you went to some shanty-town hospital with shady records. All birth certificates, provided you know your birthday, full certified name, and maybe some questions about your personal history, are certified documents that will be accepted by your state gov't.\n\nEdit: [Here](http:\/\/www.state.nj.us\/mvc\/pdf\/Licenses\/ident_ver_posterpint.pdf) is a PDF from your state website. There are six forms of ID you can use to obtain a state ID. If you want to do a name change that must take place, I believe, with your vital records office. If they want an ID that isn't your birth certificate or parents certificates, then you'll probably just have to pay extra to get a state ID with one of those records, then go back to the vital records office where you were born to change the certificate. (Name changes may be a long process, and not always guaranteed to be accepted.)\n\nRe-eddit: [Here](http:\/\/www.state.nj.us\/mvc\/Licenses\/DocumentSelector\/doc_address.htm) is a little app that the state of NJ made.

{"question":"I was talking to a friend last night, who related to me something he had heard before. Basically, the premise was that the justification for a police officer to take a person into custody was different on a public street than in the person's home.\n\nSo the idea was that, if the police come to your door and, in the course of the conversation or questioning, ask you to step outside without actually arresting you, you should decline to leave your home, as this will make it harder for them to make the case for arresting or detaining you.\n\n(For purposes of jurisdiction, let's say this is in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.)\n\nIs there any truth to this, or is this one of those silly, urban legend, \"Cops Hate Him!\"-type stories?\n","answer":" If you do decide to do it, just make sure to close the door behind you.Answer #2: &gt; Basically, the premise was that the justification for a police officer to take a person into custody was different on a public street than in the person's home.\n\nHe heard wrong.

{"question":"Me and my five siblings while minors were physically and emotionally abused, possibly exploited for tax credits, used for manual labor, and received a very poor home-school education. Now that we've left the house, we have no support from our parents, a myriad of mental issues, and extreme trouble trying to adapt to our situation outside the home.\n\nI've recently learned that our parents intend to sell the home that we spent a large portion of our childhood building. And I have no expectation that we will see a dime of the proceeds.\n\n I honestly don't know what I could sue my parents for, or if it would even be possible, but I see my siblings suffering and I'd like to force my parents to at least pay for them to go to college and cover their medical needs.\n","answer":" &gt;And I have no expectation that we will see a dime of the proceeds.\n\nThat's great, since reality will line up perfectly with those expectations.Answer #2: I'm sorry for your situation.

You are 100% responsible for the loans regardless of if he succeeds, fails, or gets hit by a truck.\n\nThe ONLY way out of this right now is for him to get loans in his name and give you the money to pay yours off.Answer #2: You can have him sign a [promisory note](https:\/\/www.lawdepot.com\/contracts\/promissory-note-form\/#.Vfn7vc6LTS8) which lays out the terms of his repayment to you.\n\nBut if he doesn't pay, the only recourse you would have would be to pay the amount yourself and then sue him to recover what you paid."}

{"question":"Hey everyone,\n\nLocation: Madison, WI\n\nMy roommate and I have been having a disagreement (that keeps escalating because he doesn't understand compromise) on chore responsibilities and now he is saying that if I don't do exactly what he wants he is going to remove my bedroom door. \n\nI contacted the non-emergency police for advice and they recommend filing a civil suit if he does that because it would be a violation of my rights as a tenet. I've tried talking to our landlord but am not making progress because he is my roommate's father.\n\nMy question I supposes is that if I come home one day and he's gone off the deep-end and removes my door or worse, what is the best course of action for taking him to court, and what am I entitled to?\n\nThanks everyone, I will update this post with more information as needed.\n","answer":" You'd likely have a cause of action against the landlord, not against your roommate. Your landlord would, in turn, have a cause of action against your roommate for damaging the property and interfering with his contractual relationship with you.\n\nThe process runs roughly like this:\n\n1. Notify your landlord in writing that the door has been removed, and that you expect it to be reinstalled on a reasonable timeframe. For something this straightforwards, three to seven days is more than enough. Put a sheet up over the door as a temporary fix, so that you have some privacy.\n\n2. If your landlord doesn't respond, or refuses to repair the problem, talk to an attorney about your next steps. It's likely you'd have to give notice that you consider the lease breached, and vacate, but that you'd be able to recover your costs from your landlord afterwards in small claims.Answer #2: If you have any valuables (computer, smartphone, tablet...) now might be a good time to store them somewhere safely off-site. Failing that you should take pictures of serial#s and of them in good working order for when they go \"missing\""}

{"question":"We live in Los Angeles CA. My 16yo old daughter got caught at school performing oral sex on a boy. He is 18. She's a Jr. and he is a Sr. After speaking with my daughter I found out he's been her boyfriend for 4 months. She's wasn't forced or intimated into doing it. It was consensual. I decided on not pressing charges. The school called the police anyway because he's technically an adult. I do not feel a young man should have to be put on a sex offender registry for a mistake made at 18. He was arrested and charged with \"Oral copulation with a person under 18.\" A Det. called me today and asked that my daughter come into the station to give her statement. My question is, are we legally obligated to give a statement even if we do not want to press charges. Can a case be made against her if we refuse?

Sorry.  You don't get to choose whether or not the school reports this to the police (they are required by law to do so) and you wont get to choose if this moves forward.  All you\/your daughter can choose is whether or not to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nYour daughter is under no obligation to speak to the police.  She does not have to come into the station, and she does not have to answer any questions.  \n\n*Usually* there is no case without the cooperation of the victim.  However, sometimes there is.

I am 22 years old, and she will result to threats of self harm and sometimes physical aggression\/violence when I've gone to look at apartments or when she thinks I have. The only things preventing me from just signing a lease and leaving for good are that my savings is a joint account with her (and she's threatened to call the bank and say I stole \"her money\" if I transfer it out to my checking) and that the car I drive and pay for is in her name (and she's not above calling the police to say I stole it). If I was under 18, I'm sure there would be some sort of advocacy group\/legal help because it would be considered child abuse. Is there anything I can do being over 18, when she refuses to sign over the car and her rights to my bank account?\n","answer":" Some of that money in the account presumably belongs to you, and since it's a joint account, you can take it and open a new account solely in your name and put it in there.\n\nYou're above the age of majority so you can go wherever you want, whenever, without anyone's permission and despite any threats that are being made if you do so.\n\nThe car is not yours and must stay with your mother.\n\nHow, precisely, you manage to move out and go on with your life is going to depend on all the details and nuances of your exact situation and really isn't part of the legal side of your question."}

{"question":"For a little more context, my boyfriend is currently trying to get joint custody with his children, but as of this point neither parent has been awarded ant kind of legal custody of them. They currently live with his ex but stay at his place a few times a week. I've been trying to convince him to get them vaccinated. (My mom was also an anti-vaxxer and that choice made my sister get incredibly sick, I don't want the same thing happening to his kids.) Would it be legal for my bf to make an appointment for a vaccination without getting into legal trouble?\n","answer":" He probably has the right to get them vaccinated if there is no current custody order in effect.  Normally, I would caution against taking such a unilateral move while the case is pending, as the judge often won't look kindly on one parent blatantly going against the other's wishes.  However, this is an exception to that rule.  Vaccinating your children is different from taking them to a church or enrolling them in a school the other parent wouldn't agree with.  I'd be shocked if this made your BF look poorly in his ongoing case, but he really needs to speak to his lawyer about it. They know the nuance of the local courts better than any of us. \n\nIf the lawyer doesn't give an answer he likes, feel free to seek other opinions from local attorneys.Answer #2: Depending on their age Ontario in 2016 all school age children must be vaccinated except in certain situations. You should be able to Google this. So with this information getting them started on their scheduled vaccinations eould be a good idea.Answer #3: Take them to the paediatrician, if they recommend vaccinating (which they will), get it in writing, vaccinate and keep the records.\n\nIf this becomes an issue during custody, show the judge the letter with the doctors recommendation, that should be enough.Answer #4: Isn't this something he can petition the court to allow?

{"question":"What can a person do when HR dept tells employee to just “talk to your boss about it.”  He will not help. This excessive work load has been going on work for five years and my health is suffering. I have vacation time-a lot,  but am told “Not now.”  So it’s difficult to find another job. I work with paperwork deadlines and the company will not hire additional workforce for this position.  I like my work but not so much as to be overbearing. \n","answer":" You've pretty much described all of our jobs.

{"question":"They are trying to fine me $500 for this and so I postponed my court date so I could explore other options. \n\nAlso, my friend got insurance that same day but the timestamps show it was after the fact. I spoke to the assistant DA and she said it might be $250 instead. I'd rather not pay them a cent. \n\nWould i be able to show the judge that i had insurance on a car and that my insurance would cover damage to someone else’s car if i was at fault?\n\nAdvice is greatly appreciated.\n","answer":" What is the exact statute that you've been cited for ?\n\nColorado, like some other states, also allows you to basically self-insure and provide proof of \"financial responsibility\", but for simplicity's sake let's just say \"insurance\".\n\nThe law generally requires three things with regard to mandatory auto insurance:\n\n1.  The registered owner must maintain insurance in at least minimum amounts specified by law.\n\n2.  A vehicle may not be operated on public roads without insurance.\n\n3.  The operator of the vehicle must provide proof of insurance to a law enforcement officer upon request.\n\nSince you had insurance that covers your operation of a borrowed vehicle, you haven't violated the second item but you probably violated the third. \n\nBoth can be resolved in court by providing proof that you had insurance that covered borrowed vehicles and was effective at the time.\n\nSo let's start with exactly which statute you were cited for violating.   It should be on the citation, something like [Colorado Revised Statutes 42-4-1409.](http:\/\/codes.findlaw.com\/co\/title-42-vehicles-and-traffic\/co-rev-st-sect-42-4-1409.html)"}

{"question":"Location : Quebec, Canada\n\nSo, I'm currently still a minor, and someone who is atheist for many reasons. However, when I told my father about this, a Catholic follower, the first thing he did was force me to attend Sunday Mass at a Catholic Church.\n\nFrom what I've learned in school, I have the right to my own religious beliefs. Did he violate any of my rights? I clearly stated to him that I don't want to attend.\n","answer":" Your parents can make you go to church.  They can also make you do the dishes, clean your room, and control what movies you see and what material you read without violating any of your rights.Answer #2: Your \"right to [your] own religious beliefs\" means that the government cannot force you to be Catholic or to go to Mass. Your parents are free to parent you how they see fit, so long as there isn't abuse.Answer #3: Not sure how they do things in the Great White North, but in the U.S. your parents are well within their rights to make you attend church until 18 or emancipation, I would imagine Canadian law is similar in this regardAnswer #4: If Canada is anything like the U.S., your parents have control and authority over you until you turn 18.

They also sent the actual lawsuit, but it seems to just be a standard copyright infringement case. https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/Zgs0w\n\n\nThanks for any help you guys can provide.\n","answer":" Sigh.\n\nThese companies file copyright infringement complaints in the hope that you'll pay instead of defending. Sadly, it works because the cost of a lawyer is more than the cost of their settlement demand.\n\nAn IP address alone does not establish that the person sued is the one responsible for the infringement. If she lives alone, it's a harder argument to make but still a valid one.\n\nFrankly, she should fight it because what they do is the legal equivalent of throwing shit against a wall and seeing what sticks... but that can be more expensive than paying."}

In your situation, there are usually 2 ways to approach this: 1) you pay all the expenses of the home **you have sole use of**, and when it comes time to buy her out of her 1\/2 of the equity in the home, you use the mortgage owed on the date she left (so you get the credit for any pay down during the separation); 2) she pays 1\/2 the mortgage, insurance and taxes, she can come and go as she pleases whether or not you are home, and when you refi, she gets exactly 1\/2 the equity at the time of refi.\n\nShe certainly doesn't owe you for any utilities."}

{"question":"This is in Colorado, U.S.\n\nI gave notice to my landlord that I wanted to move out as soon as I was allowed to, no earlier than March 15. My landlord told me she could only approve me for a March 30 move out date, and that she was \"bending\" the rules for a less than 60 days notice. So I said sure, I give notice for March 30. When I finally read the lease, I find I am eligible for a 30 day notice, which technically was March 15. My landlord is holding me to the second notice I gave (both were in writing). Is that legal? Shouldn't my original notice stand, given that I only changed it due to her inaccurate statement?\n","answer":" Ah, the old Cuban Missile Crisis conundrum.\n\nAre you on month-to-month or a lease that ended 60 days after your first notice? Do you have proof that you gave the first written notice? Does your lease state what day of the month you have to give notice?"}

{"question":"So basically I rent a house and sublet two rooms (with my landlords blessing). This one girl (only been here 2 months) wants to break her lease early because she's leaving the country. I would have been fine with it but due to her attitude and general douchiness over the last 2 months, plus the fact that it's the dead season for tenants, I don't want to.\n\nNow she's *told* me that she won't pay rent on the 1st, what can I do?\n\nWe live in the same house so we share a kitchen (actually I haven't used it once since she moved in because she's a huge pig - trash on the floor, etc) and all that\n\nIf I serve her with an N4 and she leave the country before the 2 weeks, what happens to the money she owes me? Thanks\n","answer":" If you share a kitchen, then this is likely a non-RTA tenancy, which means the N4 form doesn't apply and you probably can't seek resolution through the Landlord and Tenant Board. Your recourse is likely through the Ontario courts, instead.\n\nHowever, it's a moot point if the defendant is beyond the reach of the courts and intends to remain so. Whether you sued your tenant for breaching the lease or went before the LTB, and assuming you somehow got permission to serve your tenant by publication, the cost of enforcing a Canadian judgement in a foreign jurisdiction would rapidly exceed the amount you could ever hope to recover for two months' rent and some cleaning expenses.\n\nI think you're going to eat the loss on this, at the end of the day. Do what you can to limit your damages: see if you can get your tenant to find her own replacement, and if she falls behind on rent, give her notice to pay or quit immediately just in case she decides not to leave after all: you'll need that first step before you can petition for an eviction.Answer #2: She still owes the money. Collecting it might be more difficult as will serving her for a civil suit."}
{"question":"I have video and pictures of water, warm water, flowing from his ground on the property line to my yard causing my yard to freeze with over an inch of ice. I had to buy so much salt and break up the ice every day. I went over to his house to ask him if maybe he had a broken pipe or anything he just ignored me. I could see him in his window when I'm breaking up the ice when I get home from work. From what it looks like, the water is coming from a pipe underground into my yard, I had moved rocks(the property line has large rocks, maybe about hand size or a little larger) and clear warm water running out. What can I do? I have a 2 year old and worry about him the most. \n\n\nEdit: I also think he did this because no one was living in the house for 5 years before we moved in, people stole the copper pipes out and the microwave off the wall\n\nEdit: here is a picture of the moved rocks and the water flowing.

Like, if this violates the law in certain ways, he has the power to \"red tag\" their property and make them leave or fix it *immediately*. Not saying that will happen here, just trying to give you a sense of their authority. \n\nSo, call your Town office and ask for code enforcement or building inspector. Describe your issues to that person. They will come and take a look at it.  \n\nEdit: Just saw you're in Blooming Grove. If that's the Town, call 845-496-7011Answer #2: Most areas have laws around dumping water directly onto opposing lots. Do you have a picture of the pipe or a lot description? If he's dumping it say in his backyard, and his lot is higher than yours and that's the natural direction of water flow... you might be out of luck. If hes dumping it right at his property line to avoid putting it across his property, you might have something to go on.Answer #3: Historical note: [Water flowing onto neighboring property has been a documented legal issue since 4th century BCE](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=0cJ7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=demosthenes+speech+water+property&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XrXwEASD0u&amp;sig=-PYDTlASsv10gFIN7sLzP5KTHtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj10tyyv7rRAhUGTSYKHd-3AKIQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=demosthenes%20speech%20water%20property&amp;f=false).Answer #4: Keep doing what you're doing, send certified letters with invoices for your salt,rocks, resodding(if you are in that enviornment) plus man hours.

{"question":"There's some equipment I need that would cost me about $2000 retail. I found a person who has what I need at almost half that price.

If you have no reason to know it's stolen (and being a good deal is not, by itself, enough), then it's not a criminal issue.  If it is stolen and the real owner comes forward, it's possible you could be forced to return it, or lose it to the police as evidence.  \n\nIf you show up and this is some homeless guy with meth-face selling you $2,000 worth of equipment, there's an argument that you \"knew or should have known\" it was stolen.

{"question":"https:\/\/www.azfamily.com\/news\/buckeye-family-in-line-at-food-drive-say-man-yelled-at-people-to-get-a\/article_c32a6a46-7275-11eb-bbcd-dff24da037fd.html\n\nThese are my admittedly poor understandings:\n\n-- Yelling at people from your car is legal (as long as it's not otherwise illegal, like a death threat)\n\n-- If it's protected speech, the content of his message can't be a factor in determining criminality. For example, if he were yelling \"I love your outfit!\" instead of \"Get a job!\" that would be legal, right?\n\nDisorderly conduct seems pretty subjective. Please help me understand.\n","answer":" If the man had simply driven up, yelled \"get a f\\*\\*\\*ing job,\" and driven off, probably no one would have even called the police.  But that's not what happened.  He repeatedly yelled obscenities and insults and was obviously very *very* angry.  These days anyone would be frightened, and these people had their children with them.  I've seen men like this go from violent speech to actual physical violence in a heartbeat.  \n\nIf a man comes out of a bar, starts yelling obscenities repeatedly, and doesn't stop, it's very likely the police would arrest him for disorderly conduct and no one would question it.  This was potentially more dangerous."}
{"question":"I was made a manager where I work a few years back, and always made the same amount as the other managers. Recently someone got the job as manager, switching from a different position that made 2 dollars more. I've been doing this job for years, and now am forced to make less money than him for the time, and while I'm getting the raise \"soon\", it might not be retroactive. Is this legal, and if not what can I do about it? \n\nEdit: California \n","answer":" Yes, it's legal to pay different people different wages for doing the same job. What's not legal is paying them differently based on race, religion, color, sex, national origin, or in some places sexuality."}
{"question":"Last night I was asked to leave a concert because I was too intoxicated so I left the building and called some friends to come get me but my phone died. Being alone, blackout drunk, and walking on a broken ankle, apparently my drunk self thought it would be a good idea to take a box truck and drive it home. I woke up to cops arresting me and I didn't even know why. I don't even remember driving home. Obviously I wasn't trying to steal the truck for personal gain because I parked it out front of my house. \n\nI've never been arrested before and now I am being charged with Theft of $10,000 - $60,000 and DUI. Is there any hope for me?\n","answer":" You didn't *accidentally* steal it. You purposely stole it. Being drunk doesn't absolve you of responsibility for your actions. You need a lawyer. You may be able to get it knocked down to something like joyriding. \n\nYou may still be expelled either way. Answer #2: **GET A LAWYER**\n\nBasic thoughts: being drunk is obviously not a defense to a DUI.\n\nHowever, you may be able to get the theft charge reduced to something else if you can prove extreme intoxication (most cases, it's something called a \"specific intent\" crime). They may be able to get you on something else as well. This is a great question to ask your lawyer about."}

{"question":"I worked for my family business in Denver, co for 14 years. (I was fired because of a rumor).  During that time my mother legally gave me 20% of the shares in the company.  Can I sell these on an open market?  The only stipulation in the paperwork says that I must give them the opportunity to match the offer that I am accepting.  Also, we are obviously not on good terms now and I'm wondering If I can sell the shares, what paperwork will be necessary to find a fair market value and what happens if they won't give it to me?\n","answer":" Once you get an offer, you must present it to the other members so they can have the opportunity to match it. Do not expect the FMV of the shares by any measure. A minority interest in a family owned business is not really alienable as no one will really want to buy it for any of a number of reasons. Even as a gift, there would be a number of discounts applied for tax purposes. \n\nYou can try to sell it. If you get an offer, tell the family and allow them to get the 20% back for the pittance yo will be offered. The amount of work you will have to do to try to get a business valuation so another can make an intelligent offer is going to make the deal even harder. \n\nYour best course is to try to negotiate with the family. They are the only ones who will give you anything approaching the business value of the stock. "}
{"question":"So about two years ago my stable job of three years decided to lay everyone off and it made me unable to make my car payment and the car, a 2005 Ford Mustang GT with less than 25k miles on it, was repossessed and sold.  I thought that was the end of it.  Fast forward the present I've received a summons from the bank saying I owe them close to $5000 for what I had left on the loan.  I know for a fact that they made up money when they sold the car as it's worth was well over that.  To make matters worse I was out of state when my brother accepted the summons and I only have two days now to write out a reply and take it to the clerk's office.  I only make $9\/hour and I just had a baby so I can't really afford a default judgement on this case. I'm going to write the letter tonight does anyone have any advice for me?\n","answer":" When a car is repo'd it gets auctioned. The price it goes for is often far less than its actual value. Are you sure you \"know\" they made back the entire amount due on the loan?Answer #2: The bank is doing everything properly. You can try to work out a payment plan with whichever law firm is handling the case on behalf of the bank, to avoid a possible future garnishment, but you still have to repay the balance of your loan + fees. Basically, you making $9 hour and having a baby won't stop the creditors from taking the money owed.Answer #3: &gt; I know for a fact\n\nDo you really or are you just assuming? Demand the bank prove the debt, including what they got for a car when it was repossessed. If the sale of the car didn't make up what was owed to the bank they can go after you for the remainder."}

If it's known and doesn't intrude on anyone's expectations of privacy then  it's likely to be legal.Answer #2: Tenants have a reasonable right to privacy, this means that when you rent a house or apartment, the landlord can't put up cameras without your permission anywhere in the house\/apartment, but in the situation you're describing, the common areas are free gameAnswer #3: Yes, and it is lawful.  CREEPY AND DISTURBING,  but lawful.Answer #4: I am not a lawyer, but on r\/landlord this has been discussed, you may want to search for threads there.  The understanding is that cameras may only be placed in public areas, not even common areas.Answer #5: On the same note while you can't remove the cameras, assuming it isn't covered by any of rules in you it lease is there anything stopping you putting something in front of the camera?Answer #6: Contact homelinemn.org for better advice on Minnesota tenant rights.

{"question":"Everything is pretty much in the title. I don't think anything illegal is going on there, so it seems to me that it's more of an attempt to scare their daughter and potentially me so that I stop texting her.\n\nFor reference, I'm not trying to take her away from her parents or from parental authority.

He can also tell her to move out as soon as she's 18 and that they're not going to provide her any more financial support. So while he can't do anything to you, he can make her life pretty difficult in the near future. So that's something both of you need to consider."}

My landlord verbally admitted to me that they do not claim their 'Rent Income' on their taxes (we pay cash), and they also have a security clearance.\n\nThey also do not have a permit to be renting, which I believe in the state of CO, you do need one to rent your house.

{"question":"Hi I'm wondering if it's legal in VT usa for a parent to make a copy of a key to my new apartment without my consent. I gave my landlord permission to let him pick up the keys to my new place because when I move today the rental office will be closed. Now all of a sudden he's changed the time frame around so that I could have just picked it up for myself. We don't have a good relationship. I don't trust him with a key to my new place. If I find out he did, what legal recourse do I have in VT?\n\nTL;DR gave my dad permission to pick up keys to my new place. Thought I was moving when the office is closed. Now he changed times on me and the office will be open. What can I do to force him to surrender the key if he made a copy?\n","answer":" Could ask landlord to change lock and explain situation Answer #2: If he walked into a locksmith and had a copy made, then he has a copy and there's nothing you can do about it \"legally\". The police aren't going to bust into all of the locksmiths in the tristate area and ask if they made one key, and they aren't going to raid his house to retrieve your key, and no court is going to order him to return it to you.\n\nChange your locks.\n\nPractically speaking, maybe he made 2, 4, or 10 copies, and you get 1 copy back and think it's done. Maybe he paid in cash so there's no record. If you don't trust him with a key then you also shouldn't trust that even upon a magical court order he would give you all the copies of your key.\n\nThe same is true of anyone you loan a key to. You don't have any legal recourse or damages because they have a copy of your key.\n\nTrespassing is still trespassing, however. Theft is still theft. This is the part you're clearly concerned with, so, change your locks. Or get your landlord to change your locks. You'll likely have to pay a fee. \n\nNext time don't give your key to someone that you don't trust."}
{"question":"I thought this would be something I could google easily but like I said, everything that I am finding about what to watch out for is warnings for the buyers rather than the sellers (which I guess would be a good sign for me).\n\nSo someone agreed to buy my vehicle that lives in another state. They said they will either mail a check or do a wire transfer. From what I've read wire transfers are way safer so that would be my best bet. My only question is what info will I have to give this person? Would I have to give them my bank account number or would they just need a name and routing number or something like that? I've never done one before so I just want to know if there are any risks of it being a scam that I should be aware of.\n","answer":" It’s a scam. The wire transfer will get reversed (from a stolen account or similar)or it will be switched to a forged cashiers check. \n\nThen the “buyer” will send too much money and ask you to forward s portion of it to someone for whatever (transporting the car or something else). You remove that amount from what appears to be real money in your account and send it off to someone who is actually an accomplice of the buyer. They disappear, the check bounces or the wire gets reversed and you are out the money for the transport or whoever else you sent the money to. \n\nThere are literally hundreds of posts about variations on this scam on just this sub. Answer #2: Sounds like a scammer. \n\nHave them come down and get the vehicle and pay you in person. \n\nIf they do send a check wait several weeks until it clears (3 weeks probably). \n\nIf they send you any “overages” to send back it’s a scam. If they send you anything other than the agreed upon amount it’s a scam. If the payment is in someone else’s name it’s a scam. \n\nAnswer #3: Let me guess... They are going to give you more than the purchase amount, and you are supposed to use the extra to pay for shipping? Answer #4: scam. 100%."}

{"question":"TL;DR Comcast is claiming that I owe them 270 bucks even though I never signed or agreed to a contract. Am I legally required to pay them? \n\nI canceled my service with Comcast last month. When I canceled, they told me that I would have a cancelation fee, to which I replied that the sales rep who set me up in February said that there was no contract. The agent on the phone corrected himself and told me that I would not have a cancelation fee. Less than one week later, they sent me a final bill which had a 270 dollar early termination fee. I didn't pay and they eventually sent it in to collections which has contacted me about paying it. I have disputed the bill with them and I am sending in my dispute letter this week. I have one problem with this though: the sales rep who set me up never had me do any verification for the terms of service and I never signed any type of contract. Do they have any sort of case here?\n\nEdit: I'm in Utah \n\n","answer":" Comcast's subscriber agreement on their website specifically says the following:\n\n&gt; Unless you have signed a minimum term addendum, you may terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time by notifying Comcast in one of three ways: (1) send a written notice to the postal address of your local Comcast business office; (2) send an electronic notice to the email address specified on www.comcast.com; or (3) call our customer service line during normal business hours.

{"question":"I am a high school student currently dealing with college applications.  For most of my life, I have typically written 'white' as my race when asked.  This week, I have learned that a large majority of my background is from a small area in northeast Spain.  Every questionnaire from the Department of Education asks if I am of Hispanic or Latino origin (Spain is included in this), and I now wish to say 'yes' instead of 'no.'  After choosing the latter for most of my life, will I be punished for suddenly reversing this?\n","answer":" No. \n\nIt \"counts\" per most definitions of it. \n\nYou'll still be white though, hombre.  \n\nWelcome to the confusing world of lumping people together. Answer #2: For what it's worth, you may be able to mark both. My fiance is about as white as you can be but he's half Mexican. When given the option, he marks both Hispanic and white since he's just a white guy with Mexican ancestry.Answer #3: Yes you will be sentenced to two years as a mariachi band performer in the  New York city subway.Answer #4: I don't see how Europeans can be classified as Latinas - since that entire identity is a hodgepodge of mixed races.\n\nMaybe I'm ignorant; but I thought you'd have to have some Native\/Black\/European blood mixed in there to be Latino.\n\nIt'd be interesting to know the real answer since my Russian students have asked me about this before (if Spaniards are Latino) - I said they're Europeans with a lot of mixed ancestries from the Islamic conquests and their general geographic positioning.Answer #5: As an addendum to what has already been said - you *could* actually get in trouble for claiming to be Native American when you don't have corroborating documentation to back it up.

Our rent is considered late after the 3rd, and my fiancée processes payment earlier today for the rent. What are our renters’ rights in Texas? Is this a scare tactic or can the property management company evict us like that?

{"question":"u\/ravenchamps has been misidentified by several media outlets and social media influencers as the Madden Mass Shooter. Many of these have failed to update their statements. What does the law say about maximum recoverable damages and how would he go about claiming them?\n","answer":" There is no maximum. If he sues, and negotiates a settlement, it's whatever he settles for. If he goes to trial, assuming he wins, he has to convince the judge or jury of what his damages ought to be, and they'll make up their own mind about what they think he should get, which, depending on the defendants and the conduct, may include punitive damages. Then the judge might lower the award a bit, and it might come down on appeal as well, but, more importantly, even after the judgment is entered, there's still another opportunity for the defendants to settle, offer him a lower amount in exchange for immediate payment and no appeals."}
{"question":"Basically my boss has cut me from a salaried full time employee to being a hourly part timer. This makes it so I can't support my family anymore. I asked why the this was happening and why I was being taken off a manager track (in training to be a manager) and was met with the response that due to my history of panic attacks, i cannot be considered for management. However I have not shown any effects of my anxiety recently (3 months). Aside from some very personal attacks against me relating to my anxiety from my manager, they gave no other reason than \"you are too panicky to be a manager\". Are they allowed to do this?\n","answer":" Maybe, maybe not. It depends on how big your employer is, if your anxiety qualifies as a disability, and if accommodating that disability would be considered an unfair burden on your employer. It's not black and white either way, but you could get a consultation from a lawyer if you're interested in pursuing it."}
{"question":"This post got me thinking:\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/gt4ikx\/condo_board_is_telling_me_as_of_june_5th_the\/  \n\nIf a condo board votes to turn spot A5 into a handicapped spot, and condo owner has A5 deeded to them, what's stopping the condo board from renumbering all the spots?  Legal descriptions on parking spots in buildings are (for what I've seen) described as the letter\/number or numbers and not actual locations.\n","answer":" As a rule, the law is not a section of precisely-worded magic spells, but rather the application of imperfect language to intent. I don't think renumbering is a back door to seizing property.Answer #2: With a condo often the parking is all common area owned by the HOA, and it is either assigned or used on a first come first serve basis(usually with parking permits), or some combination. In that case the HOA can reassign spots according to their rules, and often this is whatever the current board says. If the HOA got a request from a disabled homeowner it would be reasonable to reassign some parking and mark one of the spots closest to the elevator\n\nIf the spots are deeded to owners as exclusive use the HOA cannot take a spot from one owner and give it to someone else, or make it available for everyone on a first come first serve basis, and generally they couldn't mark a spot as disabled, and doing so wouldn't mean it is open for anyone. If the HOA got a request from a disabled homeowner and they don't own any parking spots, and they can't do anything. \n\n\nSo it really depends on what the governing docs say about parking. In a building with 100 units and less than 100 spots most likely all of the parking is common area. That would mean a spot could be assigned to be first come first serve and with a disability placard, but it really depends on what the parking rules are and what you really own."}

You could be charged with a hit and run. More than likely though, they're just wanting information for the accident report. Answer #2: It may be state-specific;  in my state, you are not required to make a police report unless there is a death, injuries, or damage over $1000.   You are always required to stop and to exchange contact and insurance information.\n\nIf the police showed up at your door, the other driver clearly had *some* of the correct contact information.\n\nThe worst case is that you get charged with hit and run.   Since the facts strongly suggest you did stop and provide insurance information to the other driver, the odds of conviction are low.Answer #3: &gt; The other driver is claiming I gave her the incorrect info.\n\n*What* incorrect info?\n\n&gt; What may come of this debacle?\n\nDepends on what she says you did wrong.

{"question":"2nd degree burns (blistering) but treating at home, not seeking medical attention at this time because it’s not urgent compared to other injuries (ie broken bones, heart attack) and don’t want to expose myself to COVID-19 in waiting room.\nTopic:\nEmployment Law\n","answer":" Sorry you got injured. Is boiling water part of your job? (Not trying to sound cute, actually asking.)\n\nSimply working from home doesn't automatically make an employee ineligible to receive workers' comp benefits. It comes down to the specifics of the incident and the injury and whether the employee can prove the cause of the injuries. That said, an employee injury or illness is compensable under workers' compensation if it arises out of and in the course of employment, regardless of the location the injury occurs."}

{"question":"My Legal parenting plan in the state of Washington says I need to enter mediation to establish a visitation schedule once she starts school. She’s been going for a week, and her mother dropped her off with me with a backpack full of a weeks worth of clothing and her school supplies. I do not have primary custody but I’m pretty sure this classified as abandonment. Mother proceeds to block me, so now I have no line of communication with her mother. I am 23 years old and recently unemployed. I am currently seeking employment, but I don’t have my own transportation, as I either bus or my father will drive me if he’s got the time. He offered to give me a ride to take her to school luckily but this doesn’t help me moving forward as I do not currently have a car and my father works mon-fri. I am in between a lot of things to try to get back on my feet but would like some advice on how to navigate through this. \n","answer":" So what is it that you want?

{"question":"My sister was recently caught with marijuana. She was also caught prior to this. This all happened within the same month. Now this is her 2nd offense and she has a mandatory court date. Me and my parents want to prepare for the worst. What could the charges possibly be? She is a good kid and just wanted to try something different. I read online that the law in WI could charge her as felon and 3 years in jail for 2nd offense, I dont know if this is the maximum penailty or not. I dont want her life to be ruined because of a foolish mistake she made and I dont want her to face jail time. Am I overthinking or should me and my folks start looking for an attorney?\n\n\n\n","answer":" Impossible to guess what the charges are with no details.\n\nYou are not overthinking this by believing that she needs an attorney. She needs one ASAP. As this is her second offense, she will most likely face a stiffer penalty. An attorney will help mitigate that.\n\nIn case it still needs to be said, she should not be discussing this with anyone except her attorney. Not even you or your parents. Nor should you or your parents discuss this with anyone."}

We all hate her, but Bob, who owns the house, does not want to be an asshole and prohibit him from being with someone he wants to be with.

{"question":"A few days ago me and a friend got citations for possession of alcohol on a public beach in NJ. We had one empty can out, in a cup, which apparently is reason enough to get this. When the cop took us to his car, he wrote down my name incorrectly, and also the address where I live is wrong (but the town is right), as is my phone number. My DOB, however is correct (I am 20 but we didn't get tagged with MIPs). My friend's info is entirely correct except for his last name, which is off by one letter (but his address, etc is correct). \n\nDo I show up to the court summons on the ticket?

{"question":"Lets try this again... My mom is fighting me for custody of my daughter. \n\nShe gained custody through an emergency petition 5 years ago when I was incarcerated (for 30 days) for a DUI. \n\nI'm moving on April 1st and can't take my kid with me because my mom said she will file for kidnapping charges. \n\nI currently live in my mothers house with my daughter and I don't know if I should move to my new place or stay at my mothers because of the current state of custody. \n\nMy lawyer has entered an emergency order to get the order rescinded and hopefully have custody default back to me.\n\nCan my mother get any sort of legal custody to my daughter in the state of PA considering we have lived under her roof for over 10 years? \n","answer":" It sounds like she has custody now, so yes.  Whether or not you can move with your daughter is really something you should ask your attorney. It doesn't sound like you can right now, which is why he is filing a motion. A kidnapping charge would not help you get custody back down the road.  That would show you are unwilling to work within the system."}
{"question":"Past weekend my wife and I ordered a Lyft to get home from the airport. Our ride was about 40 minutes, and there were no issues during the trip. \n\nNext day I was notified by Lyft support email that the driver claimed I had open alcohol container. I said that was false and Lyft should gather the proof prior to making such accusation. A few days later I received a follow up email with two photos of some liquid spilled on the backseat of a car along with a $50 damage fee from Lyft. I inspected the metadata of the “proof” photos and found out that they were taken 2 hours after we were dropped off. I have been requesting Lyft to inspect the image metadata and verify the “proof”.  They continue repeating the following sentence: “Your driver specifically identified you as the requesting passenger for the ride during which damage was incurred.” I am not planning to pay for the damages I did not commit. What are my options besides blocking the charge on the credit card?\nTopic:\nDouche\n","answer":" You can try to find the driver's full name and sue them if you are charged and your CC sides with them. But you can't force Lyft to do anything. Answer #2: Maybe screen shot the photo and metadata in and send that to them just saying \"according to the metadata in the photos provided, these were taken 2 hours after we were dropped off\".   \nThey should be able to cross check that the driver gave other people a lyft during that time. Answer #3: Small claims. I believe in NY any place the company has a location can be served and NYC can take a party in any borough to court in any other borough. (One of the parties must reside there!)\n\nIt'll be interesting to see them try to produce the driver to testify. It'll be time consuming but sufficient fun if you're sufficiently annoyed at them.Answer #4: Also: file a TLC complaint."}

{"question":"I was riding a ferris wheel and it had technical issues causing the wheel to stop. Got stuck in there for over an hour, before they got the wheel moving again.

And what does it mean (legally) now that we've signed it?\n","answer":" &gt;Does anyone know why we would have to sign a form like that from being on a ferris wheel for an extended period?\n\nYou were under no legal obligation to sign it.  \"No,\" is a complete sentence.\n\n&gt;Was it a good idea to sign it?\n\nIf you agreed with everything the document said, then sure.\n\n&gt;And what does it mean (legally) now that we've signed it?\n\nThe time to determine this is before you sign it.  It's too late now, you've agreed to whatever it said.  Blindly signing a document you haven't read, don't understand, and\/or don't agree with is generally not recommended.\n\nSounds like you willingly signed a document that said that you were not in need of medical attention in light of the malfunction and might have released the ride owner of any future liability or something, maybe."}

{"question":"So here's the rundown. Basically I'm pretty young and am fairly new to alcohol. I have a friend that works at a strip club, I visited there and ended up blacking out. She left, I bought more drinks and was eventually cut off by the bartender.

Stupid, I know, but I do not remember making these purchases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently in the middle of a chargeback dispute with my credit card company.

{"question":"I’m a 38 year old female in TN and I have 2 daughters ages 16 &amp; 13. My husband wants a divorce, and so do I, but he keeps threatening me with our kids. He says that I’ll never see them and that their primary residence will be with him. He’s a convicted felon in the state of TX due to DUI’s. Also I have Fibromyalgia and haven’t been able to work in several years which leaves me no way of paying for said divorce. Any advice or information you can give me is much appreciated. Thank you! \nTopic:\nCustody Divorce and Family\n","answer":" Your husband can't withhold joint assets from you; the cost of your attorney would come out of both of your assets. \n\nAt age 16 and 13 your daughters would have a lot of say as to whom they wish to live with.  \n\nIf he says he wants a divorce, but instead of filing he threatens you about custody, it's likely a scare tactic to prevent you from filling. \n\nIf you have Fibromyalgia to the point that you can't work you should also seek disability.  \n\nWhen you say convicted felon, did he serve his time, or did he just go to Tennessee? Answer #2: First, don't take legal advice from your soon-to-be ex.  He doesn't know what he's talking about, and he is bullying you.\n\nSecond, make an appointment to talk with someone at Legal Aid.

For just a stupid mistake like this!!! Please help me.\n\nI cannot afford to have a lawyer...\nPlease... Help me!! Thank you.\n\n","answer":" OP, you're full of shit. In your original post on r\/ubc, you first claimed that you stole the math book because you thought it was too expensive but now you're claiming that you \"accidentally\" took it because you went to the bathroom and forgot. You clearly stole the book on purpose so you should be be charged and disciplined by your school. You really need to stop making bullshit excuses and trying to escape from this situation. So many people in the previous post told you to confess to the crime already and sincerely apologize to the bookstore but it looks like you're a liar and thief with no remorse. Why bother asking for advice if you're not even going to follow it?Answer #2: You *did* shoplift and I wouldn't even try and use your excuses because honestly it all seems like BS. You couldn't put the book back on the shelf or another shelf? There was nowhere to put the book on the way to the bathroom? Then you forgot about a book in your bag minutes after you put it in there? Plus you left immediately after finishing in the bathroom? None of that looks good at all.\n\nYou cannot afford a lawyer, but you need one, because getting expelled and losing your visa for theft is going to cost you far, far more long term than a lawyer will now. You don't want to try and do anything without their advice. Don't talk to the school or offer to pay or return the book or do anything.Answer #3: Well legally speaking you did shoplift.  Do not talk to anyone and if they do charge you show up to court. Either you pay to get a lawyer to help or you go alone risk losing and getting expelled."}

You gave $10.\n\nDoing 2 doesn't override 1. It would be ridiculous to prosecute for this exact scenario, but if you change the scenario to something else it might be clearer.

Don't be worried unless you're officially served with a legal document.Answer #2: I don't know German law, but if you reply, then you're admitting you received their notice, and could also be admitting it has something to do with you, and\/or that you may have downloaded something illegally.\n\nIf this were happening in the U.S., I would only respond to something I received from a process server, and would only have a lawyer reply.

{"question":"As the title suggests, my mum was very upset today, fearing the worse because her and her husband fighting lately I headed over. Thankfully that wasn't the case, it turns out she was fired from her job. She was a nurse in a county jail but was employed by a contractor. They told her she had worked 122 hours, which was a lie, and fired her for working too much overtime. I say it was a lie because she goes in when she can, stays 8 hours Monday-Friday and leaves. She doesn't love to work, but she does her job well and got along with everyone who works in the jail. She's been working with this company for quite a few years and has never even been wrote up or had disciplinary actions taken against her. Besides that, the jail is constantly monitored, which could provide definitive video proof she didn't work too much overtime, if any at all. What can\/could she do, Reddit? \n\nEdit: She was never paid for overtime even though they accused her of it. \n","answer":" She can file for unemployment and look for a new job.  Her employer isn't a court of law and isn't required to be fair or consider evidence that she didn't do whatever she allegedly did."}

Is this illegal, or is he just SOL?\n","answer":" I used to work at a Dominos; maybe I can offer some clarification. Unless they've changed their policy, he should be clocking in under either an inside position or as a driver. Inside positions typically run the register or make pizzas. Drivers deliver pizza. \n\nThe way it worked when I was there was that if I was clocked in under my inside position, I was to work the line and make food, for which I would be paid a higher wage.

Making food, in particular, or using the system to close out credit card receipts at the end of the night? \n\nUnless there's a weird agreement, it's not their policy to pay someone a higher wage because they happen not to be on delivery, but rather for inside work that means they can't go out on delivery. If he's waiting for a delivery, he's still a driver and still getting paid the driving wage.Answer #2: Does he average out to minimum wage when he factors in tips?\n\nIf so, it is legal, just shitty.

What you're looking for now is to set up an introduction period--preferably supervised so that he's not a stranger.  You can also request that he bear the burden of travel since he moved away.\n\nYou will need a lawyer to do this.  Answer #2: After your son builds a relationship with his father, he will almost certainly be allowed to take him out of state. You need to reconcile yourself to that. It's not reasonable to expect him to spend all of his visitation outside of his home. \n\nDriving halfway isn't out of the question.

If the understanding was that you were going to pay for both tickets and that was that, then her ticket was a gift from you, and she has reimbursed you for your ticket, so all is good and you don’t have a case. With very limited exceptions (eg engagement rings), you don’t get to claim back gifts after breaking up. At least that’s my non-expert understanding."}

{"question":"So as mentioned in the title, I got home around 1:30am last night after grabbing some drinks with some friends, and noticed a folder half slipped under my door. It is worth noting that I live in a 4 story apartment complex. After opening the folder, I noticed inside were handwritten accounting documents for the apartment complex with the night manager's name on them, along with some printouts of pages from accounting textbooks it looks like. There were some manual journal entries which isn't very typical considering the company seems large enough to have accounting software. I am also an auditor at a Big 4 accounting firm, though I'm not sure if they know that. Does anyone have any idea why this might have happened? Is it a simple misunderstanding?

The [IRS has guidance on this topic and requires employers to file specific disclosures to deal with tipped employees](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/taxtopics\/tc761.html).

{"question":"My young adult child purchased a brand new car all on her own (no co-signer) 3+ weeks ago. The dealership is now saying that they want to “talk about options that we have to move forward.” I know where this is going; they want to finance her at a higher rate than originally agreed to or they want a co-signer. This dealership makes you sign an arbitration clause when purchasing. Does California provide any type of consumer protections regarding these types of scenarios?\n\nLegally, what are her options? Can she opt to unwind the contract if she doesn’t like the new terms they will present and if so, is she entitled to a full refund of her down payment? She’s been driving the car for nearly a month.\n","answer":" Yes, CA is one of the more buyer-friendly states, and under the standard contract the dealer can demand the car back but must return all money. (In some states they can charge mileage for what you use on the car).\n\nHonestly this is a sign that your child may not have good enough credit to get a good deal on this car. In this scenario the wisest thing to do is to return the car, get all your money back, and work on getting a loan for a cheaper car.Answer #2: Everything about this transaction comes down to the contract she signed.  She needs to read and understand her contract.Answer #3: Sounds like you are in a good negotiating position. Personally I would just let them unwind the deal and consider it a free 3 week lease. They are not going to want to do this because they will be stuck with a car that has been driven for 3 weeks and had depreciated in value.\n\nYou could offer to finance it through the credit union if they will discount the total price to offset the difference in interest for the life of the loan.Answer #4: Firstly, celebrate!

She has been out of the country for almost 2 years now, and was a permanent resident of US for maybe 18 years at this point? How do we get her back into the states?

{"question":"In the state of PA, if the landlord did not place the tenant's security deposit in a separate account from his own that accumulates interest, are the tenants still liable for damages?\n","answer":" The landlord is required to deposit the funds.  You are owed the interest (probably a few basis points) if you were in the unit over two years.  On $1,000, expect about a dollar or two.  You can certainly sue for this amount in small claims court.  Further, in Philadelphia, you can file a complaint with the Fair Housing Commission.  I'm sure other municipalities have a comparable agency.   Unfortunately, the odds of the agency doing more than sending a form letter to the landlord reminding them of the requirement is likely as far as that would go.\n\nThis would *not* relieve tenants from damages.  A tenant may be able to negotiate the dollar or two back into the calculation based on the interest they *would* have earned.  \n\nThe current interest rate in Chicago for security deposits is 0.010%   We have a listing by year.  \n\nhttp:\/\/www.cityofchicago.org\/city\/en\/depts\/dcd\/supp_info\/security_depositinterestrates.html\n\nA $1,350 deposit over about 3 years yielded me in the neighborhood of $5."}

{"question":"[Anaheim california] so I walked  out to my car this morning in front of my house  to find a lovely ticket on my windshield. It was for not having a front plate on my car.

{"question":"I live in AZ. My building was built in the 80's and isn't very thermally efficient. We do things like put air guards under our doors and put tin foil with cardboard in the windows and whatnot, but it's not enough. In the summer it is consistently in the *high* 110's (F) outside, and several times a year it reaches low 120's. Our unit's AC can't keep our apartment below about 85 degrees on most days, and that's with it running constantly. (I understand that that's a 40-degree difference, but that knowledge doesn't make an 85-degree apartment feel any nicer.)

I immediately told my manager, but he was already gone. I have three managers, but unfortunately I only one of them to have my back. \n\nI have made it clear to this customer that I find this unacceptable, however he persists. Do I have any legal route I can take to strongly encourage him to knock it off?\n","answer":" I cant imagine managers would be happy about a customer throwing things out of one booth\/table into the rest of the floor near other customers. \n\nHere's an idea that does not really go through the legal system at all, but its relatively hassle free and there are no downsides to trying. \n\n Your store probably has an online customer satisfaction survey thing right, or at least if its a chain it does. There is literally nothing stopping you from filling out one of those yourself.  Say that you're a regular and that you usually dont complain about things but there's another customer who is regularly throwing things around and it makes the experience less enjoyable. You could even throw in a \"Im impressed by how [your name] handles the situation.\" \n\nManagers see those.  You really only need to write one.  This is how I got my manager at Applebees to stop yelling at me over guests constantly. \n\nLegally, you could call the police but there's a 50\/50 chance they do nothing.

{"question":"So my friend lives in North Carolina. She moved into a rental house several months ago. Last week she found out from another friend that a registered sex offender lives next door. This friend was just doing a random search for recreational purposes. This person's crime was committed 20 years ago when he was about 30 years old and the victim was a minor. The registry doesn't really go into more detail. This makes her very uncomfortable because she has a five-year-old daughter. She was never told by her landlord. \nIs there some legal precedence about a scenario like this that would allow her to break her lease? Please let me know if more information is needed. I was vague in order to protect the identities of everyone involved, of course. \n","answer":" &gt; She was never told by her landlord.\n\nI would be *stunned* if the landlord was required to disclose this.  \n\nThe landlord is not responsible for the neighbor, and unless the lease has an unheard of \"sex offender next door\" clause, then this will probably not be enough to break the lease.\n\nDon't let the guy babysit or pick her up from school- beyond that it should be fine.Answer #2: There is no requirement to disclose that your neighbor is a sex offender. She (and everyone) is capable of looking it up before renting. \n\nAlso, sex offenders are allowed to live anywhere (depending on probation restrictions). So it is very hard to live anywhere in a large city without one being near. And those are the ones you know about. There are likely plenty that you come across in life that you don't know about. \n\nHer child is old enough to talk about safety with. That is the best option here. Answer #3: Almost certainly not unless her lease guarantees no sex offenders within some distance from the house. And I'm sure it says no such thing.\n\nThis is a matter outside her landlord's control and is not inherently dangerous.\n\nTell your friend to keep in mind that \"minor\" can be all the way up to 17 years 11 months 29 days, remind her how much people can change over the course of 20 years, and that she should be keeping an eye on a 5-year-old daughter anyway."}

Legality of job applications comes when applying for jobs with the State or Federal government.

{"question":"My mom has power of attorney for my grandmother, who owns a home in Florida.

Next thing, we're getting another bill for lawyer fees, fine, whatever, we paid it, AGAIN. Now we're getting YET ANOTHER bill for lawyer fees for the sending out of the previous letter about lawyer fees. So what, are they just going to exponentially increase the amount of money we owe them to send us letters until they take the house? What the fuck? This whole situation honestly makes no sense to me and the HOA refuses to explain to us why we owe them more money. My mom went to court about it and said the judge was very dismissive and refused to answer her questions about how this made any sense, and the HOA isn't letting up. They've placed a lien against the house. What do we do?\n","answer":" You are either withholding information from what you are posting or information is being withheld from you about what is going on. \n\nEither way, there is more going on. The HOA can't refuse to answer questions regarding what is owed and the court wouldn't refuse to answer questions or be vague in any ruling. If a lien has been filed, get documentation from the court or HOA showing what it's for and why it was filed. Answer #2: IANAL but this is a new way that HOAs are fraudulently using to take homes. There have recently been several similar posts, about predatory HOAs. They will team up with a lawyer to take people's houses out from under them. They can then flip the house, or move in their friends and Family. \n\nYour grandmother's property in Florida is possibly quite valuable.

This guy has also been physically abusing my brother to the point where my cousin and I had to stop him and make sure he didn’t beat him into serious injury or a coma.\n\nMy brother also had to give a statement on what happened and such already.\n\n\nHe has taken close to over a $1000 dollars from my brother and he wants to get it back. Is there any type of legal action we can take even though he isn’t 18 yet?  \n\n(This is in Seattle, WA)\nTopic:\nInsurance\n","answer":" Report him to the police or to a teacher for the physical abuse, and to a teacher for kicking him out of the house - if he’s still a minor, this is abuse \/ neglect of a minor. \n\nTake him to small claims court for the theft. Bring records of what he paid to his father (if it’s checks, bank statements should cover it), the evidence that he wasn’t on the car insurance, and if he has any records saying that the payments were supposed to be for car insurance (e.g., emails, texts, the memo line on canceled checks, or notes he jotted down to himself). \n"}
{"question":"I was playing with some kids in the building garden, and a woman and her husband came and started telling the kids to \"shut the fuck up\".

{"question":"My parents owned a small liquor store for the past ten years and we still have about $89k left to owe to bank from the original $300k that we bought the business for. Now our lease is set to expire this July and we think the property owners are setting to demolish everything and rebuild. \n\nWe know this one, there were people few days ago measuring everything (according to my dad). Like they took measurement of the whole plot. Second, there were 3 out of 5 unused spots behind our business and one of which was a personal gym that had just recently opened but had to close unexpectedly. We are speculating that the property owners might have terminated their lease. \n\nAll of this is pure speculation. We're not entirely sure if they're going to demolish everything or there is going to change in ownership.\n\nMy question is what should we do? What should be expect? We still have tons of debt and we're kind of worried about the future of our business. \n\nThis is OC, California.\n","answer":" Why don't you just ask them?  If the answer is yes why don't you look for a new place to lease nearby and start telling customers NOW that you are moving.  Also, have the two overlap so that your last month at the old place your windows are full of signs and maps pointing them to the new place?Answer #2: The property owners are free not to renew the lease, unless they've made some sort of contract with your parents that requires them to renew it.\n\nYour parents can try to negotiate such a contract now. But if you're right, and the property owners do intend to demolish everything, they likely won't agree to such a contract. Your parents can't force them to agree if they don't want to.Answer #3: You should ask the property owners what their intentions are. "}

SCOTUS decides matters of law, not matters of fact.  They take the facts as determined by lower courts and decide how the law applies to them.\n\nOf course they can- they can look at previously decided cases, other SCOTUS or appellate opinions, or nearly anything else if they so choose.\n\n"}

I do look young, but I always have valid ID. \n\nToday while ordering a mimosa at Breakfast, I was denied because \"learner's permit is not a valid form of ID\" I spoke to the manager and he claimed that the law changed with the recent tobacco age change. \n\nIs there any validity to this? And is it within his rights to deny me? Its my only form of ID, but I had plenty of credit cards, debit cards, and checkbooks for him to verify that the info matched.\nTopic:\nConsumer Law\n","answer":" &gt;And is it within his rights to deny me?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes your learner's permit have a photograph, just out of curiosity?Answer #2: Generally speaking establishments can refuse to serve alcohol for any even vaguely legitimate reason, having doubts about the authenticity of your ID is a pretty strong one. Not sure how they're made in Nebraska, but all the learner's permits I've seen are basically just laser printed on cardstock and extremely easy to forge or duplicate.Answer #3: A quick lookup:\n\n&gt; The five types of identification that are lawfully acceptable in the State of Nebraska for the purchase of alcohol are: 1) a valid \r\nnot expired drivers or operators license from any state, 2) a valid not expired new style State identification card, 3) a \r\nmilitary identification card, 4) a passport or 5) an Alien Registration Card.\n\nSo, they could interpret that to mean learners permits are not operators licenses.

{"question":"This happened awhile back but it just occurred to me to ask this question.\n\nI have told my doctors about my past marijuana usage.

So I’m wondering if it’s legal for any doctor at Kaiser to access my medical record... Does it have to do with the fact that I’m the mother of the doctor’s patient who is a minor?  It’s possible I signed something I didn’t read.  \n","answer":" A physician is permitted to see your medical record if it is necessary to help with your current diagnosis or treatment. \n\nKaiser is an enormous HMO, and their EMR system does have all Kaiser patients information. It wasn't illegal for the doctor to look at your medical record because looking at the mother's health during pregnancy is important to care for newborns. \n\nHowever, Kaiser also cares quite a lot about patient satisfaction and would entertain a phone call or letter about your concerns. You would try the compliance office if you want to discuss your concern over the necessity of the doctor to see your records to treat the child, or the quality assurance department or whatever they call their customer service hotline this month if it is just a general concern on the physicians behavior.

So for example we also have a amendment that says no forced labor, but an additional one that says all males are required to perform military service, which overrides the former amendmend.\n\nIs this the case in the US? If not, how can americans be drafted?\n","answer":" They can be drafted based on the fact that the Court has interpreted the phrase \"slavery or involuntary servitude\" to mean something very specific and not taken those words in a general sense."}
{"question":"[New York] The sequence of events, over the course of many years, is as follows:\n\n1. My dad's sister married an awful man.\n\n2. My grandma's will leaves money to my dad and his sister.\n\n3. My dad's sister dies. \n\n4. Grandma revises the will to leave my aunt's widower way less than he expected. \n\n5. Grandma dies. (She was in her right mind to the very end, amazingly sharp, more \"with it\" than people half her age.)\n\n6. Aunt's widower is arguing that he's entitled to his dead wife's assets from an older will.\n\nMy question is, assuming the recent will is valid...that makes no sense, right? \n","answer":" The widower can sue and dispute the will.

{"question":"Disgusted and shocked. My hands are shaking. I don’t know what to do. My boss sent me an email asking if he could take my virginity—I don’t know if he’s drunk or what has happened. I quit the job but now he is saying we have a contract that says I must finish editing a project for him. This is true and I signed it months ago. Is it legal for me to not follow the terms of the contract if he sexually harassed me? I have reviewed the contract, and there is no mention of voiding it for this reason. \n","answer":" Does your company have an HR department? Can you contact your bosses boss?\n\nIf he is going to be a pervert, at least he did it via traceable e-mail. Forward that e-mail to your personal e-mail address to save as evidence. Answer #2: This is, like, the stereotypical case from a workplace sexual harassment training. However, some facts are very important.\n\n1. We need to know your location. Labor laws are very location-specific.\n1. You say you have a contract. Are you an independent contractor, or an employee? Employees can have contracts. Don't count on what your tax forms say, [go off of the IRS's guidelines.](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/employee-or-independent-contractor-know-the-rules) If you are an employee, your workplace protections will be substantially better.\n\nAs another commenter said, forward the email to your personal account, and then print out 3 copies, and leave them in different safe places. Then, go to an employment lawyer and ask for their opinion. This sub can't litigate your case for you; \/r\/legaladvice's biggest use is telling you whether or not you should spend your time visiting a lawyer. It's probably worth your time to do so, especially if you think you are more likely an employee.Answer #3: I can't believe he memorialized that in writing."}
{"question":"A lot of people are worried that they’ll be fired for not being able to get back to their jobs in time. Are their any labor protections here? Thank you.\n","answer":" Not to get too political, but this is what unions are for, and NC is notoriously opposed Answer #2: There are no protections for this in NC. Answer #3: Wouldn't hurt to apply for unemployment if you are fired. And its pretty common to get rejected your first attempt so try at least twice. Answer #4: I believe because NC is an at-will employment state, you can be fired for missing work, unless there is a mandatory evacuation. If you do get fired for evacuating, I would call your local and state representative for help. Answer #5: The only labor protection is that you would almost assuredly receive UI if you were fired.\n\nThat's what UI is for -- for when you get fired for a bullshit reason."}
{"question":"So I've read a few stories where someone says that the couple was divorced, the wife usually gets Alimony payments winds up with someone else later on. The receiving spouse refuses to get married to the person their with or comes to an agreement with their current spouse since their receiving essentially free money. Could you successfully argue in court that since the new couple has been living together that Alimony is no longer necessary since they can support each other like a married couple? Has this ever been successfully done in court?\n","answer":" Alimony is based on what is set in the decree and what the judge orders.\n\nA competent lawyer who represents the person who is paying alimony will almost ALWAYS set a condition that alimony either ends after a certain time limit and\/or if the person gets married.\n\nA judge likely won't approve alimony being ended prematurely due to living with somebody, since alimony is to assist the other party in maintaining a certain level of living standards.\n\n[Assuming USA]\n\nEdit: I want to add that some states require alimony for X years based on how many years you have been married (looking at you California)"}
{"question":"So I just got home from the hospital today after being hit by a sedan on the way home from work. Was heading home in the bike lane and had the right of way.

Then the roof and then the trunk and finally the damn street. Got her license plate and 4 witnesses (5 pm in Southern California). Police reports from everyone involved. Went to the hospital and got CT scans and 11 x rays. Forgot to mention was transported via ambulance. What the hell do I do?\n","answer":" I read the comments on your original post and I want to say: God damn what a bunch of idiots.\n\nRegarding the ones telling you to sue her into the ground: It won't happen and it is best for you that this doesn't need to happen because you really want her to have sollid insurance right now.\n\nSince it happened today your first order of business is taking care of your own health rather then thinking about if you need to sue or not.\n\nA lawyer might not even be needed if you don't have damages that might only present in the future or will impact your future health. My go to saying in situations like this is to file a claim with her insurance and then to wait and see what their initial settlement offer will be, if it's fair then it doesn't make sense to spend about 30% of it on a lawyer, if you believe it's not fair (fair being that it covers your damages) or if your damages are so complicated that it would possibly impact your future health then it might be time to talk to a lawyer.\n\nAt this stage: get well soon.Answer #2: Talk to a personal injury attorney"}
{"question":"I live on Tennessee. His mother and I have been separated since my son was three and he just turned 5. For the fist year after we broke up I saw my son every weekend and took him to my home. January of last year he wouldn't let me take him, and hasn't let me see him but once this last year. I've tried talking to her and pleading with her and she insists I'm some sort of danger to him. \n\nMy question is I want to get him back, and the courts here aren't very father friendly, what kind of options do I have? There is paperwork I can file, but one option is to file for full custody or just visitation. I want to make sure that I have the full range of legal rights as his father, while establishing 50\/50 custody of as close to that as possible. \n\nDoes anyone know of limitations that can be held against me? I share a two bedroom house with my brother, would him not having his own room be a problem?\n","answer":" The idea of courts that \"aren't very father friendly\" is mostly a myth. While there *are* real instances of gender bias in custody decisions, they aren't quite as strong or as common as popular wisdom would have you believe. The real problem is that you've been out of his life from 4 to 5, and were only getting him on weekends from 3 to 4; this will make it hard to argue that a 50\/50 custody order is in his best interests.\n\nThe fact that you don't have a bedroom for him could also be an issue if you're seeking custody. Children in Tennessee conventionally get a bedroom separate from their parents. Her allegations that you're a danger to him would also be a factor, if she can substantiate them.\n\nYou'll almost certainly get visitation, though; even child abusers often get (supervised) visitation. So if you want to see your son, you should absolutely start the court process."}
{"question":"Last October I made the mistake of lending my car to my brothers girlfriend ( i didn’t think she was gonna get into an accident obviously) and she hasn’t made a single effort to pay me back at all. I’m very young (20 at the time) so I have basic insurance + glass and it only covered the damage done to the other car and she hasn’t given me anything until last week she came by my house and wrote a receipt for 155$ and gave me 80$ saying that my grandmother was supposed to give me the other 75$, i don’t wanna take money from my sick grandmother what i wanna know is if it’s worth it to take her to court!

{"question":"The thought struck me earlier. If for example, you caught someone doing some shady shit and they offered you a payout to keep quiet, is it legal to take the payment if you immediately hand them in anyway? What would the law dictate happens to the money when the case is cleared up?\n\nI have heard that straight up accepting a bribe to not testify is illegal, but I am curious as to what would happen in the case of an unsolicited payoff. The illegality of the act would nullify the contract, right? I’m from the UK but I’d be interested to hear from people here, in the US, or anywhere else.\n\nAn addendum: what about cases where your personal safety was at risk? Let’s say you catch someone dealing drugs and you’re outnumbered.

{"question":"I purchased a handgun in 2011 in Reno, NV. I moved out of state at the end of 2012 and left my handgun in a box in the basement with some other items in the house i lived in with my friend\/roommate.  My roommate remained living in the house and in 2013 someone broke into the house and stole a bunch of stuff. Including his t.v., gaming consoles, computers, ect., along with my handgun.  I immediately reported the gun stolen online to the Reno Police Department. My friend also has a police report of his house being broken in to.

And I don't live in Nevada anymore, I live in Colorado now. What do I need to know about this, and what should I do?\n\nThank you in advanced for your advice, and let me know if you need anymore info.\n","answer":" I'm a bit confused here...\n\nWas the notice of seizure for the gun?\n\nWas the property found by the DEA?\n\nIf the property is something you want to get back, you'll need to reply to the notice and that will probably require a lawyer. This sounds very much like an asset forfeiture.Answer #2: Does the notice make mention of forfeiture? Presumably it gives you information about the seizure and the government's intent. Without specifics it's difficult to guess what will happen or what you might want to do.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are four possibilities. The government keeps your handgun permanently (forfeiture), they hold it as evidence of a crime and return it to you later, they sell it and possibly remit the proceeds, or they return it to you immediately.\n\nIf you want it back, you should file a petition of remission with the DEA within 30 days. You have to include your information, including SSN; the information from your letter about who seized it, where, when and why; and as much proof as you can muster that it's legally yours. This petition is by no means a guarantee you will get it back."}
{"question":"We have signed on with a venue who is changing their policies on providing (or not) alcohol. Previously they stated that if we have beer it must be purchased through them but we can bring our own wine. Now the venue has said that they have been approved for a Winery and Beer permit for 2016. Because of Idaho State law they must provide all of the alcohol at the venue. I recognize that they are obeying the law but I am wondering if there is any wiggle room here as they are only offering a choice between two reds and two whites. We would like the flexibility of sourcing it ourselves.\n\nIf there is no room here we are also wondering if they can force us (as they have) to purchase \"Host Liquor Liability\" insurance, being that we are no longer providing the alcohol?\n\nI get the feeling that they have us over a barrel but I thought I'd ask those in the know.\n","answer":" 1.  You have a contract with them.  The should honor the contract, or compensate you if they cannot.\n\n2.  Just because they have to provide the alcohol doesn't mean they cannot order your choices, and serve it to you.  It just means they can't have an outside vendor.\n\n3.  If your wedding is dry, they cannot charge a host liquor liability insurance.

{"question":"Condensed version of a fairly complicated situation:\n\nAn in-law wants to sell me a ground floor condo apartment for below market price, but the upstairs neighbor has Right of First Refusal in the condo contract. \n\nAre there any options for getting around this contract clause, such as gifting the apartment, or invoking some kind of familial exemption? \n\n(Some other quick details: the apt is in an \"irrevocable trust,\" the current owner is my grandmother who was wed to my grandfather maybe 10 years ago, the trust is handled by my grandmother's two sons from her first marriage.)\n\nThanks\n\nEdit for location: Apartment is in Brooklyn NY. \n","answer":" I may be misreading the situation, but it sounds like OP's in law wants to sell the property at a significant discount but the right of first refusal would allow the neighbor to buy it at that (severely discounted) price if he likes?\n\nCould the in-law sell it at a price the neighbor wouldn't be interested in and give a gift of equity to OP instead? This should also allow OP to purchase the property without a down-payment or PMI (as long as the gift is more than a bank would require for down-payment or PMI).\n\nThe neighbor would still have a right to purchase, but at the selling price. Would that work, or would the neighbor have a right to the gift as well?Answer #2: This depends on the wording of the clause, and your jurisdiction.Answer #3: Probably not, the law likes to enforce contracts and doesn't so much like people acting in bad faith of them. It is impossible to say for sure though, I would have a local lawyer look in it over to see if it is sound."}

Shortly thereafter, she told me she was pregnant, then subsequently told me she lost the baby prompting this post - https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/7tv1ra\/can_i_be_held_responsible_for_medical_bills\/?st=JKFEGO8Q&amp;sh=37d0c4d8.\n\nNow several months later, I’m being lead to believe she lied about losing the pregnancy (something she claims was done to protect me) and will be having the child. My first steps are to confirm she is in fact pregnant and get a paternity test done. I want to start thinking about what this will mean if it’s true, and I want to prepare myself for any and all legal consequences, as she and I are on very contentious terms.\n\nI expect that she could look for child support, I don’t know how that system works (in New York) or if there’s anything else I should be thinking about. Any advice you can offer might help me stop freaking out, thanks. \n","answer":" She can file for paternity and support. You can ask for visitation if the paternity shows you are the father\n\nYou cannot \"confirm\" she is pregnant nor force a paternity test until there is a child"}
{"question":"Edit: sorry,  I'm in Illinois.  17 is legal here. \n\nI'm newly out and have been trying out grindr lately. My type is cute short guys, and almost all of the guys I've talked to that fit that description turn out to be underage. So far they've always mentioned it pretty early into the conversation, they'll tell me straight up that they're 16, but I'm scared that one day I'll meet up with a guy and he won't tell me.\n\nSo, my question is basically, could I still get in trouble? If they're on grindr I should be able to assume that they're 18. Their profiles all said 18. If I can show that they never mentioned otherwise in the chat, how strong of a case can I make for myself? Is there any precedents on this?\n","answer":" Since you know that it's possible that 16 year olds can pretend to be 18 on the app, I hardly think you could argue that you just assumed that the ages were correct. Even if you made that argument, it wouldn't matter, as statutory rape puts the responsibility on you to make sure you aren't sleeping with someone underage.\n\nMind you, you don't say your state, and it's possible that 16 is perfectly legal where you are. \n"}
{"question":"So my insurance provider, State Farm, has sent me bills like clockwork for ten years.\n\nThis September, my stepdad fell ill, followed by my two uncles who helped raise me. I came home to care for them, and lost track of the billing.\n\nHowever, NO letter was sent to my address - the same listed address I've had for years. Not a bill, not a second notice, not a notice of cancellation.\n\nMy agent made a typo in her system for my phone number, so two payment texts were sent to someone else who did not reply.\n\nThis CANNOT be legal, can it? To be booted from a policy wituout a bill or notice of cancellation?\n","answer":" &gt;This CANNOT be legal, can it?\n\nIt's perfectly legal. You're responsible for paying your bills on time and for making sure your contact info on file is correct and up-to-date. Failing to receive physical notice of a bill that's due or overdue does not absolve you from having to pay it, nor does it prevent your policy from being cancelled.Answer #2: Unfortunately, they can. They and any credit institution will tell you sending a bill is a courtesy. You are responsible for keeping track of your insurance payments. If you missed payments and enough time passed without closing the gap, they most likely had the right to lapse your policy."}
{"question":"I live in TN. \n\nMy roommate is renting out her room to AirBnB guests without my consent.

I am tired of living with a constant influx of strangers; the next time AirBnB guests come into my house, can I call the cops? \n","answer":" You live there too. Nothing turns away an AirBNB guest like someone else in the apartment that likes to walk around naked, furnishes the place with dildos and portraits of aborted fetuses for decorations, and keeps the place smelling like frankincense.\n\nJust remember, you don't have to be hospitable to these people."}

{"question":"So like the title says, my ex roommates moved out with under 24 hour notice and now are blatantly lying about giving us a 60 day notice, about how we threatened to sue them and how one of them feared for her safety and belongings. All of it a total lie, but I have no idea how to prove it is a lie, after they handled the move out situation so poorly, we did decide to take them to small claims court but I don't want some stupid lies to get them out Scott free while we take the $4500 hit. We are in florida.\n","answer":" From your other comments it sounds like they were on the lease with you, and it's a fixed term lease. If that is the case the notice they gave likely doesn't matter. They signed the lease and are responsible for their share of the rent throughout that lease term. However, it's important that you pay the rent in the meantime, in full. You can sue them for the amount they were supposed to pay at the end of the lease term, after you've paid it.Answer #2: In small claims court, you'll make your case, they'll make their case, and the judge will decide whom he believes.  If their case is more compelling than yours, they may win.  You don't necessarily have to prove that they're lying.  You have to prove that your version of events is more likely true than theirs.  \n\nWith $4,500 involved, it would be worth it to me to talk to a lawyer. "}

Tell them you and your wife understand that they have concerns over the level of noise, and you would like to try and work with them to resolve that. Give them your phone number and tell them whenever they hear the \"jumping and running\", or any other loud noises, to give you a quick call so you can find out what's making the noise and hopefully do something to stop it. It may be that something you are doing is louder to them than you realize, OR it's not uncommon for some residents to think the person above them is making a bunch of noise, when its actually someone next door.

Almost no chance you’ll get any kind of jail, at most a fine.Answer #2: Don't stress out too much here. Worst case is you'll owe a fine. Nobody goes to jail for screwing up a couple years. The IRS *really* just wants to get paid, and would much prefer to be paid than to spend money chasing anyone down.\n\nSo the good news is that it's pretty likely you were under the minimum where you're required to pay taxes (about $12,000, depending on the year) for some of that time.

If an officer orders you to produce ID, you're better off producing the ID then and following through later.  He does not have to prove to you, on the street, that he has reasonable suspicion."}

{"question":"[New Jersey] My high school is having an optional after graduation party. In the permission slip to go to it, it says you can't leave before 4am. I don't have to go, but if I do I would have trouble staying awake that long. If I left early even though I'm not supposed to, could the school sue me for violating the permission slip?\n","answer":" Our local high school does something similar and you're free to leave at any time but they call the parents to let them know you left regardless of what time it is or if you are over 18. It's not a legal matter, it's a CYA matter for the school. Answer #2: You're an adult so presumably you have the legal right to leave whenever you want to.Answer #3: Doubt they would actually sue you since I can't imagine what damages they would have for you leaving early.  I don't know what other repercussions they might be able to hold you to.\n\nDo not sign a contract you do not intend to follow.Answer #4: My high school tried this on me.  I was bored out of my mind and tgey said I couldnt leave.  Really?  I'm an adult and you want to hold me against my will?  Pfffft.  I left, nothing happened, nothing can happen.Answer #5: legal action as is sue no.  Can they punish you at school yes they can.\n\nReason they don't want you to leave until after 4am is due to legal liability on their part.

{"question":"Curious as to how this situation will pan out and wanted to know how it would be processed legally. This past weekend about 10 of my friends (19, female) attended a fraternity party where we were drinking underage. The drinks at the party were poisoned with peroxide as an alternative to date rape drugs I am assuming. All in all, these 10 girls ended up having to go to the hospital, however, I as well as them received amnesty for underage drinking due to the fact that they needed medical care, thus we are free from legal trouble in terms of the underage drinking. I have a vague idea of who did it (a fraternity from a neighboring college) but I want to know how this would pan out: could this be attempted murder as peroxide causes systemic toxicity? Since this seemed to be an attempt at an alternative to date rape drugs, can intent be somehow proved? Curious as to how this would pan out: any thoughts?\n","answer":" Attempted murder requires the intent to cause death (hence the attempt to commit murder).  So if you're right about the intent of a poor man's date rape drug, no, attempted murder wouldn't seem to apply.  \n\nRest assured, however, that if caught, the perpetrator of the crime faces plenty of potential felony charges.  Answer #2: Hydrogen Peroxide would not be a suitable choice for a date rape drug.

{"question":"I received a move-out invoice from my former landlord to the tune of my entire $1700 security deposit to replace and repair a garbage disposal and a refrigerator ice maker unit. Thing is, I never used these during my two-year tenancy and would've had no idea if they were or were not in working condition.\n\nOn top of this, he is charging me $400 for repainting one room (said he deducted $200 for normal wear-and-tear, so really $600) for some black marks on the wall. We're talking a room that is probably 10'x10' and all solid off-white. I just painted my entire 3200 sq. ft. house for less than that.\n\nAm I on the hook for these exorbitant charges? I feel like I am being fleeced. Unfortunately, I have no pictures from move out as I didn't think there would be any issues. Any repairs I've needed in the past were taken care of and handled properly by both parties.\n\nThanks for any advice.\n","answer":" If he cannot point to any actual damage in either of those components, then he can't make a case for why they should be replaced. That being said, it's pretty weird to not use a garbage disposal; they would tend to get clogged if not regularly run, so you might expect some skepticism there. However, disposals are cheap and installing them is super easy (I've done it myself and I'm by no means a good plumber).\n\nThe paint is, I agree with you, purely bogus. Paint damage is almost always just wear-and-tear, and that price is outrageous.\n\nI would ask for a breakdown of parts &amp; labor for each of his fees, and countersue for the return of most of your security deposit."}

Those process are, mainly, notifying creditors, following the law about how people get paid if there aren't enough assets to pay them.\n\n(2)  Yes you can refuse.

That's just what happens with an uncovered sandbox and the landlord will find that out if he evicted all the pets. The only solution short of shooting every feral and stray within a several mile radius is to cover the sandbox when not in use.Answer #2: Seems like the landlord hasn't done much investigating to see who is responsible. First step would be installing cameras near the sandbox for a few weeks to see if you can catch who's letting their dogs use it.

If you intend to sue for discrimination or something, you have to be able to provide a better reason than \"because they didn't call me back.\"Answer #4: &gt;I left my application about 2 weeks ago and I've been to the establishment about 5 times to check on said application\n\nGranted I have no experience in restaurant work, but it doesn't seem that unreasonable to take two weeks to gather and go over potential applicants.\n\nAnd... I dunno, showing up 5 times in a 2 week period is what, roughly once every two to three days? I'd be a bit hesitant to hire someone who did that, seems like an indicator of a potentially high maintenance employee.\n\nMostly, though, I just don't think there's really anything to indicate that you haven't been hired by virtue of your race or religion.Answer #5: You're going to need a lot more than that.

But as for just trying to give a dog to someone else without their consent, is there any legal basis to it?\n\nTL;DR I don't want my mom's dog, she's threatening to ship him anyway\n","answer":" Legally, your mom can do with the dog what she pleases, including shipping him to wherever you are, donating him to a shelter, or euthanizing him if a vet will perform the procedure.  You're free to do what you want.\n\nPersonally, I think you should take the dog and do the legwork to find him a new home.  How do you think things would have played out if you let your mom know when you left for college that you did not want the dog?  Instead, your mom has cared for a dog she (presumably) didn't want for 4 years, and now that the time has come for her to be able to get rid of him, you're reneging on your part of the deal.Answer #2: If she ships him to you, find a nokill shelter in your area and give the dog up or refuse to accept the dog and don't sign for it.  She can ship any non-legal stuff to you all she wants and you can refuse to accept it all day long.\n\nI don't know of any legal way to stop her from shipping the dog."}
{"question":"Long story short, my friend needs to couchsurf with me for over 30 days. I trust this guy fairly well, but in the absolute worst of the worst case scenario, I want to avoid him possibly turning into a tenant of my apartment. I know long term guests can sometimes become tenants by staying somewhere too long. What can we do to legally ensure this can not ever happen and that I can kick him out at any time?\n","answer":" You can apply to become an innkeeper.Answer #2: If he stays there that long, leaves his stuff there, and sleeps there nightly, he will most likely be a tenant. I'm not familiar with NC law, but in most states the bar is very low for someone going from guest to tenant. \n\nYou need to come up with a short term lease and have him sign it to give you some protections. The last thing you want is for you to think he is not a tenant and when you go to have police remove him they tell you you have to evict him. A lease won't prevent you from having to legally evict him, but it will give you better leverage if he overstays.\n\nThe only way to avoid any complications is to not let him live there."}

Or if you prefer  - he'll get off on a \"technicality\" as the people who are 'tough on crime' like to gripe. Answer #2: There are two hurdles that I see for the plaintiffs to over come.\n\nThe first is standing. The plaintiff must show they are directly damaged for the ability to sue. Standing is NOT gained through simply being a tax payer. I do not belief the plaintiffs have standing to sue.\n\nSecond, is whether or not this is a \"political question\". Historically, some issues have been punted by SCOTUS as a \"political question\", which is essentially saying to Congress \"figure it out, this is not an issue for the courts\". This may or not be considered a political question if it makes it past the standing issue."}

{"question":"So I was reading about trumps wife suing the daily mail for libel because they published that she was an escort back in the day and people seem to think that she will win a pretty good amount of money. Now if we assume the daily mail pulled this out of their ass no evidence and published it, she sues, and then later on it comes out she was an escort. Would the court reverse the verdict, lesson it, or nothing since it was libel at the time?\n","answer":" The court would almost assuredly *not* reverse the decision, as the statement would still be defamatory at the time it was uttered.  If the person who spoke it had evidence of their assertion then they would've presented it at the time.\n\nTruth is an absolute defense to defamation, but the defendant has to prove truth to succeed.

{"question":"My neighbors have serious issues regarding their pets. We have called animal control on a separate occasion a couple months ago to report on a similar circumstance. They had both of their pitbulls sitting in the heat for days at a time. They were definitely under weight, and extremely unhealthy so after a week or so I called animal control. When animal control showed up they took the dogs and one was adopted and the other was euthanized sadly :(. \n\n\nFlash forward to today and I noticed they have gotten another dog! And it seems to be getting the same treatment as the others. Being a owner of a dog and a cat I hate seeing another animal being so obviously neglected. I want to call animal control but at the same time I don't want him euthanized. Please, does anyone have any suggestions? \n\n\nI'm not sure if this was the right subreddit so I posted on r\/dogs as well. Thank you for any help that you provide.\n","answer":" Call animal control and call local rescues.  Provide them with as much information as you can.  They might be able to get the dog from the shelter.  If it's too sick, there's not much you can do.  But also call the police and make a report about the history.Answer #2: You can also call the ASPCA, it is most definitely not okay to leave the dog out in the heat like that!!! Especially if he's on concrete or asphalt. That temperature jumps up even higher and burns their paws. Make sure you let whoever know that this isn't the first time and you're concerned they'll keep doing this. They may receive penalties that include banning them from dog\/animal ownership in the future. "}
{"question":"Made the foolish mistake of shoplifting 50$ worth of groceries. I'm broke this week and wanted to make someone a nice dinner (details are irrelevant, I know I did the crime.) Got caught by store security, was told I'm not being pursued civilly, will get letter in the mail charging 100$ administrative fee and will be give pre-charge diversion. While I'd obviously infinitely rather do community service than go to court, I was wondering what impact this will have on my criminal record and more importantly, I'm a law student, whether or not this can be expunged in time before I get called to the bar. Thank you very much. \n","answer":" &gt;I'm a law student, whether or not this can be expunged in time before I get called to the bar.\n\nOh Jesus. You realize that the \"good character\" statement you sign is actually much broader than just criminal convictions. Candidates are [actually required to](http:\/\/www.lsuc.on.ca\/with.aspx?id=2147495479): \"to disclose, among other things criminal convictions, whether they have been subject to a penalty imposed by a court, administrative tribunal or regulatory body, **or whether there are other matters in their past or present circumstances that may place their character at issue**\" [Emphasis added].\n\nAnd committing theft as a \"joke\" is, well, not a very positive sign of good character.\n\nConsidering your whole professional existence is actually at stake here, I highly recommend finding a criminal lawyer who also has experience in professional misconduct (i.e. LSUC discipline committee) hearings."}
{"question":"This is literally happening to me right now, they've asked I leave today or tomorrow instead of waiting the two weeks. What do I do?\n","answer":" You leave today or tomorrow, unless you can convince them that there's some reason they should let you stay. This is the standard practice with some companies.Answer #2: [This is assuming you're in the US, and may depend further on what state you're in.  You didn't specify where you are.]\n\nYou told your employers that you quit.  Your employers said \"ok, good luck, leave today or tomorrow.\"  It's pretty simple.  Unless you have an employment contract that says otherwise, your employers aren't obligated to give you two weeks, and you're not obligated to give them two weeks.  This confuses people, because folks hear the \"two weeks notice\" thing and assume it's mandatory.  But the vast majority of US employees are at-will employees, and can be fired (or quit) at a moment's notice.  Answer #3: Quitting by giving 2 weeks notice is a professional courtesy you are offering your employer, not the other way around. They are free to decline that offer and ask you to leave immediately.Answer #4: do a 360 and moonwalk out of there. all this does is to tell your coworkers not to give 2 weeks notice. "}
{"question":"It was around 11, I was with my two other friends that were 16 and 17. We were gonna go to the park nearby to hang out. We pull into the parking lot and I see a cop so I tell us to turn around. We got pulled over at the end and we were told to give our names and all the normal stuff. I have two last names. When I was younger, I had a different last name due to my moms boyfriend changing all of our last names, let’s say it was Hauser. The officer asks for my first and last name, so I give the officer my name and nothing comes up. According to the officer, the only name that was in the system for me was my other last name, Brookehouse(not real name) I was charged a ticket for lying to an officer. the driver of the vehicle was charged with being at the park after hours. My other friend was charged for lying, but actually said all of her info wrong at first. Is there anything in particular I should do? Should I just sit back in court and take the charges? \nTopic:\nSmall Claims Procedure\n","answer":" This isn’t small claims procedure. You’re being charged with a crime. I don’t know if you intended to add that flair but lying to an officer is very much not a small claims issue.\n\nYou should probably get a lawyer as soon as you can, but what specific crime does it say you were charged with? I’m not a lawyer, but the only cases I’ve heard of this happening are where you lie in a police report or are intentionally trying to use a lie to get out of another charge. \n\n"}
{"question":"My brother's property is having a warehouse built next door.  Their house has been there for decades, maybe even over a century. They received the blueprints for the warehouse and found that the warehouse would actually be partially located on their property.

{"question":"I'm trying to get out of a cult really, their crazy and I want out, parents and pastor trying to make me stay by suing, could this work? I'm 20.\n","answer":" By suing you for what?\n\nYou are an adult.  Move away and cut off contact if that's what you want to do.\nAnswer #2: You need to work on your trolling.  No real Mormon would refer to a pastor, and your posting history shows you live in Huntsville, AL, not Utah.Answer #3: Life advice, not legal advice. I am guessing that parents and pastor are threatening that they will sue you for all sorts of things, like owed money, taken property, etc.  But out of the goodness of their heart, should you see the light and return to the church, they will forget about these threats to sue and welcome you back with open arms.\n\nDON'T DO IT!  If you give in to these threats, even once, it will only reinforce the people who are threatening you. And then you will never be free of them, they will keep coming back and coming back and threatening even more.\n\nYes, they could conceivably sue you (anyone can file suit for anything), and you would have to defend in court against this. But it's very unlikely; they know that they don't really have a WINNABLE lawsuit but if they can control you via threats, they won't have to actually sue.  Out in the world, the threats to lawsuits ratio is very small.\n\nThere are actually some legal maneuverings that you can do to keep the harassment to a minimum as you leave the church; the support groups and \/r\/exmormon will help with these.\n"}
{"question":"I run a famous instagram page showcasing vintage photography by others. Would I be able to construct a magazine compiling these photos, putting them in collages, etc. as long as I give credit to the photographer on the bottom?\n","answer":" No, you can't legally do that.

Answer #2: I know you said debit card but see if your bank would do a chargeback.Answer #3: IANAL but wouldn't they have to sign for it? Wouldn't that be considered fraud?Answer #4: A little late to this party with another option.  If you are on  (EDIT: or near) a large state campus this should work.  Call up campus police and find an officer with something like a 'Greek Liaison' title.  Campus police often have someone dedicated to dealing with Frats.

{"question":"My girlfriend, who currently lives in a different state, had a break in at her house yesterday. Needless to say, she’s pretty freaked about the situation.\n\nI was thinking about buying a gun for her as a gift. I have no reason to suspect she would be denied this purchase if she were to make it herself.\n\nI know that the whole “straw buyer” for purchasing a gun for someone who can’t legally own one is a thing. But I’m not sure if I might fall in that territory if I were to, hypothetically, buy her one for Christmas. Especially if she is legally allowed to buy\/own one.\n\nWould the situation change if she were to move to my state prior to the purchase? Or would I be, hypothetically, better off giving her the money and allowing her to make the purchase herself?\n","answer":" Another suggestion is to give her a gift card for the cost of the gun, let her buy it and fill out the 4473 herself."}
{"question":"I was trying to sell my dirt bike on Craigslist and I ended up getting scammed. Anyways, I kept the dirt bike and all that. My bank ran the fake check through, gave me the money and the next day after I sent this person some of the money I realized it was a scam so I withdrew all my money from the bank, cancelled my debit card and filed a police report. I gave copies of all my phone records between me and the other person to the police for the report. I filed a fraud dispute with the bank as well. I am currently -$2,000 in the bank. The bank is calling me saying I owe them the money after they sent the check through and saying if I don't pay it back they can really screw me credit wise and all that. What are my options? \n","answer":" You do owe the bank the money. Your options are to pay the money back or have terrible credit for many years and probably get sued which will cost even more.  The reason scammers keep doing this is because idiots keep falling for it.Answer #2: So, let me get this straight. \n\n1. You deposited a bad check. \n\n2. You withdraw the money\n\n3. You now have ~$2000 that isn't yours.\n\nYeah, you owe your bank 2K. They can sue you for it or send the debt to collections. \n\nWhy didn't you just let the check bounce?"}
{"question":"Tl;dr is that I tripped over a gas pump hose trying to step over it a few months ago and sustained a fairly serious injury, dislocated a bone and tore the ligaments and stuff.

Is there something I'm missing? I am in California. Can provide more details if needed.\n","answer":" IANAL- My common sense says no. You tripping because you stepped over the hose is on you. There was nothing negligent on their end. I don't think the people telling you to get a lawyer understand how lawsuits work.\n\nIt's like trying to sue Nike because you tripped on their untied shoes while you were wearing them. (IMO at least)\n\nEdit: spelling Answer #2: The gas station probably has video and probably can see that it is your own clumsiness causing your fall which would negate the settlement."}

{"question":"My wife is in her third trimester and was approved for 12 weeks of FMLA by her employer when she was only about 7 weeks pregnant. During the pregnancy she has had monthly doctor visits. Routine check ups. She has used PTO for some and some have been unpaid time off. They informed her yesterday that these appointments would count towards her FMLA time. Meaning she will get less maternity leave now. Is this legal? Is it worth fighting?\n","answer":" If she has enough PTO she can use that. Otherwise they can make her dip into FMLA.Answer #2: Yes they can do that. Now *most* employers only start the FMLA clock when the employee is out substantial periods of time or not working at all, but there's nothing to say they can't count every little half hour here and there related to her pregnancy towards her 12-week bucket as long as it's within a 12 month period.

She told me that the call was being recorded and that for legal reasons she could not tell me why she needed the money. \n\nWhat possible scenario would involve her needing money, but being unable to tell any other person why she needs it?\n","answer":" There is an IRS scam where someone calls you saying you owe money and to pay it asap. If you say you don't have it, they will tell you to get it somehow. So you say you'll call someone and they agree, but they tell you they are listening in on the call and undre no circumstances tell the person why you need the money.\n\nShe's being scammed.Answer #2: It sound like she is being scammed and the scammer convinced her the call was being recorded (probably wasn't) and she needed the $500 to avoid some fake serious consequenceAnswer #3: *fiancee*? or *wife*? \nBecause yesterday and a few other times, you've been referencing a wife...

{"question":"My company offers 100% free medical benefits to employees only wishing to cover themselves but charges over $400 semi-monthly to choose the family coverage.  Besides being unfair and backwards (people with families tend to be more stable) I'm wondering if it's even legal?\n","answer":" Why do you think it is illegal? It is how most places run their insurance. Why would a single person get a $500 benefit package and a family of 5 get a $2500 benefits package?Answer #2: Practically every company has different rates for family and individual. 4 people have 4 times as many health problems. It costs more to cover. Does 1 movie ticket cost the same as 4?\n\nYou are actually lucky that individual has no premium. Most people have to pay.Answer #3: &gt;employees only wishing to cover themselves\n\nSounds like your employer pays 100% of the cost for all employees regardless of family status. If an employee wants to have other people (his family) covered then they need to pay out of pocket.\n\n&gt;Besides being unfair and backwards\n\nIf you think married people with kids are in any way more stable to single people than you are backwards. An employer acting on that misaligned belief would be illegally discriminating based on family\/marital status.\nAnswer #4: it sounds like a cost difference. Its cheaper to cover 1 person then a family of 4. Do they pay anything for family? they may cover the employee portion and the extra for other members is covered by the employee themselves"}

Knowing her appraisal is this week he decided to \"reno\" the entire bathroom! Ripping out the toilet, dismantling the shower and shattering tiles which cover the walls. Aside from delaying the appraisal I'm wondering if there's any other course of action that she can take?\n","answer":" The appraiser can likely appraise the property as improved or as completed.  This might actually be to her benefit if he is improving the property.Answer #2: Typically in appraisals there is a section for broken, misrepaired, or damaged portions of the house which includes a term called \"cost to cure.\"\n\nThat spells out the damaged area and what the appraiser estimates  the cost to make the area whole again.

Is there anything I can do beforehand to protect myself just in case?\n","answer":" Just make sure you can prove you made the payment and that it was for a full year's rent. Preferably, get a written receipt from the landlord. Answer #2: You need a receipt stating exactly what the payment was for and for how much. Assuming you are also paying a deposit I'd suggest two separate payments and two separate receipts.\n\nAnd I assume your landlord is OK with you doing this? Because many landlords wouldn't be - they use the credit report to make a judgement call not just about whether you can pay but if you are likely to be a reliable tenant.\n"}

The bigger issue I see here is going out to eat with less then 10 dollars on your debit card. r\/personalfinance probably has some tips for you.  Answer #2: Call the restaurant and ask them to fix the charge, then call your bank and ask them to waive the overdraft fee.

I researched MI tenant law and followed the proper procedure (I gave them a forwarding address, they sent me an itemized list of damages, and I disputed the damages via certified USPS mail within 7 days). I've run into a problem however. Landlord-tenant law refers directly to traditional security deposits, and doesn't mention the tenant rights concerning surety bonds. I spoke to the leasing office and they told me that 100% of their residents have Sure Deposit surety bonds, and the option to use traditional security is not available. Surety bonds take a lot of the dispute power away from the tenant, so by making them mandatory, the apartment complex gains an unfair amount of power in regards to damage disputes. Is this legal?

Does it not follow logically that sex between two minors should not be legal, regardless of supposed consent?\n","answer":" It depends heavily on the state.  Many states make an exception in their statutory rape laws that allows for consensual sex between two minors, or between a minor and another person close in age.\n\nIt's not as simple as saying minor cannot consent.  We allow minors to consent to certain things and not to others.  For example, minors have a limited ability to consent to medical procedures even against their parents' wishes.\n\nThe thing that we're trying to address with statutory rape laws is the power imbalance that exists between an adult and a minor.  You could say that a minor cannot meaningfully consent to an adult due to that power imbalance.\n\nWe are generally much less concerned with outlawing two teenagers giving in to their mutual hormones."}
{"question":"My wife applied for a open position within the company she works for in October last year.

And they responded with they didn’t reach out to her because she was on leave while they were interviewing.\n\nIs this an EEO violation? \n\n\n","answer":" OP- I would actually suggest that *not* contacting here while on maternity leave was the appropriate decision. Most employers don't want to open themselves to the risk of a lawsuit for contacting employees for work-related activities when an employee is on leave (particularly if it was an FMLA leave)."}

{"question":"Hi, I need some advice.\n\nBeginning last winter, some of my neighbors began to make a habit of driving their snowmobiles all around the neighborhood. (it's a small town, but we're not in the middle of nowhere)\n\nLast year I just accepted it because they would only do it on weekends for short periods of time.\n\nThis year has been much worse. They now drive on the sidewalks, in everyones yards. They do this during the day and at night.\n\nI have a lot of concerns about their behavior because there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood. I also worry for my dogs, and I am now afraid to let them outside. \n\nSo basically, should I call the police on these people? Or am I overreacting \n","answer":" Well, no one can really say if you're overreacting because if you're unhappy or feel it's unsafe for your animals, then that's how you feel. I think the better route would be speaking with your neighbors, non-confrontational. If they don't want to stop or reconsider what they're doing, you can inform non-emergency what's going on and inquire what your local laws are. If it's the sidewalk, I wouldn't really say that's a huge issue (not ideal) but they shouldn't be going through people's yards."}

Answer #2: &gt; If I put a footnote disclaimer on every comment that I don’t want my words reproduced, are journalists obligated to obey?\n\nEven if you were publishing your remarks on your own site, this wouldn't be enforceable any further than banning people who broke that rule from your site. On Reddit, you don't even have that luxury.\n\nIf you don't want your remarks repeated, don't make them in public. For most purposes, social media is \"in public\" even in quasi-private modes like locked subs and private messages.

{"question":"First of all, I am over 21.  Thus the account supposedly should be in my control now, but from what I understand she has to sign something despite my coming of age.  Is there any way to circumvent this and gain control of the account?  Asking her to sign it over might get me kicked out and I don't presently have another place to go.\n","answer":" Can you go to the bank and ask what they need to shift the account to you?\n\nBut if it requires her signature your choices are to ask her directly, or to go to the court and ask the court to force her to sign.  Both of these will likely result in you being kicked out.  Since you're over 21, you have no right to live with your folks, you live there at their whim.  They would need to, legally, give you 30 days notice as a tenant (even if you don't pay rent.)  But if they boot you out, your remedy is to go to court, and get damages, which isn't all that helpful in the winter in NY.\n\nSo, before you do anything, secure a place to live, at least temporarily.

{"question":"TX\n\nFriend's dad has been going to the same doctor for years. He kept asking for a prostate exam because he felt like something wasn't right, but the doctor kept refusing, saying he was fine, just probably had IBS. After a while he decided to go elsewhere, had an exam, some tests, and now he's found out he has a huge tumor that has tested positive for prostate cancer. If it had been caught sooner it would have been much easier to treat, but now it has had time to spread and it's pretty serious.\n\nIs this something that he can take legal action over? Or is this just simply a case of \"Sorry your doctor sucked, should have got a second opinion sooner.\"?\n","answer":" It's worth having a conversation with a malpractice attorney, but the question of why your father didn't seek a second opinion sooner is likely to come up, as well. Malpractice is so intensely fact-specific that we really can't give good advice, other than to speak to an attorney, but consultations to determine if it's worth digging into this are generally free or inexpensive.Answer #2: In 2004, Texas essentially legislated medical malpractice out of existence. Most cases are now too expensive to pursue when compared to the likely outcome. \n\nNonetheless, you should definitely seek the opinion of an attorney who focuses on med mal. Try to find one who has been practicing since before 2004 and still practices med mal. This is a sign that they are likely good at it."}

So for many people that hunt a lot, it's not worth the risk to hassle a game warden; and they'll let him search whatever he wants. "}
{"question":"(England) My friend was in a public toilet and as she left, a man exposed himself to her. She froze and then ran. If she kicked him in the bollocks would she have been in trouble or no?\n","answer":" It is still assault.  And it is still illegal.  The likelihood of actually being prosecuted for doing so is likely negligible but it is still a crime to kick someone in the nuts even it they are exposing themselves."}
{"question":"Hello, \n\nI sold my car about 4 weeks ago to a guy off Craigslist. The car was sold for dirt cheap as I wanted it removed ASAP. I've already signed transfer papers and the car has been transferred to the new owners name. \n\nMy problem is that the guy who bought it is just refusing to pick it up. Because the car was sold so cheap he doesn't want to pay for a tow truck that would be the same price he bought the car for. His solution is to fix it and drive it home. I've made it clear that this is unacceptable and it needs to be removed ASAP, as my driveway is not his workshop.\n\nHe keeps saying he'll remove it over and over again. \"By this weekend for sure\". There's always an excuse. \n\nI'm lost as to what I should be doing now. The car is just sitting in my driveway. What should I be doing to resolve this? \n\nThank you very much for your time and any help you can offer.\n(In Canada BC)\n","answer":" Give him a reasonable deadline to collect his vehicle and inform him that if he does not do so by that date, you will be contacting a tow company to remove the vehicle from your property.Answer #2: If he has already paid you, have it towed.

{"question":"My grandfather had a stroke a few years ago which left him with dementia. A couple of days ago he was having a hard time swallowing and went to the hospital. He was then diagnosed with throat cancer and his doctor told us that he does not want to treat him because of the dementia. Can the doctor legally refuse him? FL\n","answer":" The only time a patient has rights to care is when there is an emergent need in the emergency room of a hospital that accepts federal money through Medicare. Even if the patient walked into the ER and was found to not require emergency care, they are not guaranteed treatment but can be referred to the appropriate level of physician for that care be it primary care or an urgent care clinic. \n\nOn the other side of this, you fail to tell us what type of doctor refused to treat? Oncologist? Primary Care? Internal medicine? Podiatrist? I can certainly see an Oncologist, Internal Medicine Specialist, or even Primary Care more recommending palliative care vs aggressive chemo or radiation especially with a stroke survivor suffering dementia who might not understand the more aggressive treatment plan. Answer #2: If you are in the US, yes. The only time doctors can't refuse a patient is in an emergency situation. "}

{"question":"So a little more detail, on Friday 11\/2 this person ran a red light by about 6 seconds, I caught the entire thing on my dash cam but fortunately she admitted fault to the police officers who responded so no need for the footage. \nLater in the day, I spoke with the claims adjuster who works for HER insurance company. This person reassured me that someone would be out to the tow yard that day to take pictures of my car etc. She said they would get the value of the vehicle and give me a call shortly after. This was now 10 days ago and I haven't heard from anyone at the company. I've called the adjuster every day starting Tuesday 11\/06 and leaving polite messages to call me back with any information. I've also contacted my insurance company (GEICO) who have also tried to get in touch with anyone at their company with no luck. Her insurance company is Bristol West. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do in this situation? Should I get a lawyer? Any help is appreciated. \n","answer":" File a claim with your insurance company.

{"question":"I work in-house for an ecommerce business in Omaha, NE. We switch over to the new system of clocking in\/out to track overtime hours because of the new overtime law for salaried employees. I didn’t sign any paper work, I was just given a letter informing me of the change. My manager was under the impression that I wouldn’t get docked pay for working under 40 hours because I’m a salaried employee. Well, I got docked pay on my last check and HR is trying to tell me I’m now hourly and I HAVE to get 40 hours every week or I’ll get docked pay. I was only working 7.5 hours a day before that so I wasn’t even getting 40 hours a week.\n\nMy offer letter states that I would be brought on as a salaried employee and I find it very fishy that they now want to pay me hourly instead of just adding overtime to my salary. I can't afford to lose any money if I don't clock in 40 hours a week, I would really appreciate some help.\n","answer":" You aren't being \"docked\" pay.  You're now a non-exempt, hourly employee.

{"question":"I live in Colorado and my parents are divorced. The state took money out of my bank account, that my dad is a co-signer for, (I’m 16) for child support that my dad didn’t pay because he has been out of work due to an accident. I am the child that child support is being used for. What can I do to stop the state from taking money from me and how do I get it back? Also, my dad is now trying to use my money and transfer it into my account then have child support take it and give it to my mom and then say my mom is taking my money... I don’t know what to do and how to stop my bank accounts from being used to transfer money because I’m a minor.\nTopic:\nJuvenile and Youth Law\n","answer":" Because your dad's a cosigner, the account is legally also his, even if the money in it isn't. The state is in the right to garnish it, initially.\n\nYou and your mother should sit down with her attorney and figure out how to stop your money from being levied for your own support. You may be able to get this levy reversed by showing that the money came entirely from your paycheques, but this will keep happening with any joint accounts you have with your father. Moving your money into an account in your name only (if you can find a bank willing to do that at 16, or as soon as you turn 18) or into a joint account with your mother would be very good ideas."}

{"question":"Last week I was terminated from my position as communications coordinator for a small firm in Texas with around 7 employees. \n\nI am almost twelve weeks pregnant (i.e. still don't show and have full capabilities to work full-time), but I stupidly told my boss out of excitement two weeks ago about my pending pregnancy. Although at the time my boss feigned excitement, his actions toward me completely changed and I was unexpectedly fired five days later. I have zero doubt it was because of my pregnancy disclosure as I have been a top employee (literally never miss work) for the past year at the firm.\n\nDo I have any federal or state\/local laws to stand on? Based on a simple \"Google\", it seems like almost all pregnancy discrimination laws require the employer to have at least 15 employees in order for an employee to bring a claim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Disclosed pregnancy. Fired soon therafter. Small firm. Legal recourse? \n","answer":" Unfortunately you are correct, Federal anti-pregnancy discrimination laws only apply where a company has 15 or more employees and Texas  (unlike some other states) does not have any state laws that are more protective.Answer #2: Well it does look like the 15 employee rule comes into place here, but thats 15 employees or more total. If theres just 7 employees in your department, but 8 more who work elsewhere in the company then you may have a claim. Otherwise it looks the only option from here would be unemployment which you will recieve due to being terminated at no fault of your own. \n\nIm sorry this has happened and its medieval that in the 21st century where companies can get away with this type of \"right to work\" stuff. Id reccomend to use the internet (glass door, indeed, yelpt etc.) to post non-slanderous facts about the company to make others aware that said company can terminate employment due to pregnancy. "}

The witnesses stated that it was clearly his fault. He then failed his sobriety test.

They have not started the mitigation process or sat down with the lawyer. My trial is set for next month. They told me to retain the services of a outside counsel to help my case. It's too much money and I refused because I can't afford it. My attorney is now threatening to withdrawal and said that once they do, I won't have an attorney and I won't get my money back unless I retain the outside counsel they recommended. \n\nIs this right?

{"question":"Is there any way for him to be “re-instated” in August? Or for him to be POTUS again before 2024?\n","answer":" Sure.  The easiest way would be for Harris to resign, Biden to appoint Trump as VP, the senate to confirm him, and then Biden to resign.  There are other paths, through being appointed Speaker of the House, President pro tempore, or being appointed to the Cabinet.  All of them require a pretty unlikely series of events, though.\n\nI suppose the states could also call a Constitutional Convention and just rewrite the Constitution to make him President.  Or someone could overthrow the government by force.\n\nAnyway, the short answer is anything is possible, but it's more likely that you throw 100 pennies into the air, and they all land on their edge.Answer #2: Here’s to hoping he doesn’t become president before 2024, in 2024, or ever again. He’s a disgraceAnswer #3: Yes. The same ways that anyone else outside of the line of succession could become the U.S. President before 2024. Trump is not in any kind of special position, legally speaking.Answer #4: Lots of comments about the complicated legal way, but if it were to happen the most likely way would be a coup."}

He freaked out (but again at no point did my dog attempt to bite him or hurt him in any way) \n\nI stepped on his leash, and then held him back.

No. Per your story, the man was not injured, so he has nothing to sue for.Answer #2: He could sue you because your dog farted on him as he walked past.\n\nAnyone can sue for anything, doesn’t mean they’ll win. If you get sued, show up in court.

The traffic on 495 and 66 is constantly running at 70-75 and yet the speed limit is set at 55 for some magic reason. And lest you think to down vote remember that Virginia attempted to have a law where they could charge you an exorbitant amount just for getting the ticket and that was struck down by the supreme court, so I'm a little less inclined to believe this has anything to do with safety and everything to do with getting money for Virginia and VA lawyers.

{"question":"[Oregon]\n\nWe got verbal consent from our neighbor to trim his tree branches over-hanging our fence line. \n\nAfter trimming the branches on our side of the fence, we received a letter a few months after claiming they are not happy with what we did or how it looks.  \n\nThey are suing us for the cost of a quote they got from a tree repair\/trimming company to \"fix\" the look of the canopy (over $500+).\n\nWe are not professionals  but we did not cut anything on their property.  Are we responsible monetarily for the canopy or look of the tree?  If so, what are the fines associated with this type of lawsuit.\n","answer":" Hahahahahahaha.\n\nThat's what the judge will say if you get to court. You didn't even need your neighbour's permission to trim branches overhanging your property. \n\nThey just don't like how it looks? There's no injury to the health of the tree? Too bad for them. Tell them to go pound sand. Answer #2: If they sue you in court please don't ignore it. If you don't show up they automatically win by default.Answer #3: IF they are foolish enough to sue, be sure to show up at court.\n\nOther than you're not showing up, there is little chance of you losing."}
{"question":"I have a family member who was married to a man in May of last year whom she had just met. They both live with their parents and have never shared an address. There are no assets involved. \n\nShe is now pregnant and expressing regret in her choices, particularly in the marriage. I looked over the grounds for annulment in MA and I’m not seeing anything that particularly addresses her situation. The grounds only discuss living at separate addresses after fraud has been discovered. There isn’t any fraud in this situation, just stupidity. \n\nI know she will have to get a lawyer, but I am trying to help guide her through the process (annulment or divorce) and was wondering what it might look like in a situation like hers.\n","answer":" An annulment means the marriage was not valid valid from the beginning, not “this was a mistake.”\n\nYou do have to show why it was invalid. Bigamy. Turns out you are close relatives. One spouse was forced into the marriage. One or both spouses were mentally incompetent (which can include being so drunk or stoned they didn’t know what they were doing.) One spouse committed fraud in order to get the other one to marry. Not all fraud is grounds for annulment. The Mass. courts say many deceptive or fraudulent acts won't be grounds for an annulment, and if you knew or should have known of the fraud, an annulment won't be granted.”\n\nLiving together or not doesn’t really count. There are couples with good marriages that don’t live together after the marriage. One is deployed overseas in the military, for instance. One needs to go back to the country of citizenship to await a visa. They just plain do better not living together (I know a couple like that.)\n\nThe living together part by Mass. law is that as don as you believe  the marriage is invalid, you should not live together. \n\nThere are also faith-based annulments. These have no legal standing, but if her faith has restrictions on remarriage of divorced people, she could look not that. The faith may have different criteria than the law.Answer #2: Is she pregnant with her husband's child? If so, that very likely negates the possibility of an annulment since they consummated the marriage."}
{"question":"I'm looking to understand how holiday pay works as my employer said that they do not acknowledge Labor Day as a holiday. I know that the day is a federal holiday so I guess I have been wrong about how holiday pay, i.e. Time and a half, works. \n\nI'm not mad I guess, just disappointed they don't appreciate us laborers on labor day of all holidays. Can someone clarify how holiday pay works?\n","answer":" [Here are the Colorado rules](https:\/\/www.colorado.gov\/pacific\/cdle\/overtime) for when employers have to pay overtime.\n\nHolidays aren't on the list.  Some companies do pay overtime on holidays, either because it's company policy or because it's in their contract with a union that they do so.  But it's not legally required.\n"}
{"question":"(Missouri) I have a small business. Part of my business involves selling my work in packages. Since our name and logo are Hollywood themed, can we name our packages after famous actors\/actresses, either real names or movie names? For example, Can I call it the Scarlet O’Hara package? \n","answer":" A suggestion from a complete non-expert: you could probably go with veiled references, say, just calling it the \"Scarlett\" package and describing it as \"old Hollywood glamour\" or whatever goes with Scarlett O'Hara that would bring her image to mind without explicitly referencing her name.Answer #2: You'd almost certainly have to ask the appropriate studios \/ rights-holders for licensing permission. Which they may very well grant, it's no hassle to ask them. Doing it without explicit permission could at the very least end up with you reading a Cease and Desist while you stare sadly at all the printed labels and packaging you paid for and can no longer use.\n\nHonestly, I'd start generating a backup plan now, though."}
{"question":"So I had court today, and baby momma told the judge that I quit my previous job to avoid child support, and even though I explained it was because I couldn’t drive the 250+ miles a day and immediately had another job, the judge said he didn’t believe me, so he ordered that I pay CS at a rate $15 an hour even though I only make $11. This is gonna ruin me, I won’t be able to afford my bills, my house. I don’t know what to do. What are my legal options?\n","answer":" You can request an adjustment to your child support. It takes time, and you will need to bring proof of income, bank statements if you have a bank account. I live in FL, and went through periods of differing pay rates. Highest I paid (for 1 kid) was about $400 USD\/month. The lowest was about $250.Answer #2: You can appeal, but that's probably not going to go anywhere unless there's no evidence in the record to support the court's findings. Otherwise, you can't really do anything until there's a significant change in circumstances. Your best bet is to look for a job more commensurate with your experience."}

Would he have had to forge the signature, or could the dealer have done it without those things?\n\nThat's easy.  Guns don't come with titles.

I did not have control of my mental health condition and I would of wanted to complete my terms of service.

The cop that was standing to the trunk loudly proclaimed in the middle of my conversation with the other cop that there was a large huntsman spider in between the crevice of my trunk, and that I should pop it open to get it out. At the time I was like “oh fuck I’ll pop it open quick and let it out” but now looking back on it I knew he was trying to peek inside my trunk. Is this legal? And if this happens again would there be any repercussions for not listening to what that cop said?\n","answer":" That’s a new one.\n\nNo warrant needed to look at whatever is revealed if you open your trunk in response to learning from a police officer that a spider is lurking in the crevice.\n\nNo legal repercussion from refusing to open the trunk, either.

How best to respond?\n","answer":" Without a location it will be impossible to say anything specific. \n\nAre you in regular communication with her otherwise, or is this the first contact you've had?\n\nIn general, my suggestion would be not to answer, or to answer only that you no longer have the piano. If she sues you, a lot may depend upon the specifics, especially of you offering the piano and saying \"she didn't want it\".\n\nPianos can range in value quite a bit. Assuming this was something like a yard-sale quality piano that could easily be replaced inexpensively, just telling her you no longer have it might make this go away, in a practical sense.

I live in Tennessee. I've read up on the laws for Tennessee about dating a minor, and they have a romeo and juliet clause that states if you are under 4 years age difference that it is okay to date. I would like to know if that applies to me as she turns 17 a couple months before I turn 21. Technically I am 3 years and 300ish days older than her so would that clause apply to me?\nTopic:\nOther Civil Matters\n","answer":" Yeah, that clause will apply to you. Be careful though, there are other things you can run afoul of.

I agree with the other commenter, it sounds like you managed to create a circuit between the two cells and some other metal object, keys maybe?  That's going to be hard to blame on someone else.

(I am pretty sure that I know the answer to this but my roommate is insistent on trying this. I've kept him from doing this because it is dumb)\n\nWhat **can** I do to ensure he is taken to a medical professional and does him being a citizen of Oman change anything?\n\nEdit: This may be averted as we got him to sleep and hopefully that was the root of the problem\n","answer":" &gt; Is it legal for me and my roommates to force him to go to a medical professional?\n\nForce him how? Laying a hand on him would be against the law, if that's what you mean, and there's a good chance the hospital will call the cops if you drag your friend in by force.\n\n&gt; Is it legal for me to put melatonin in his drink?\n\nNot just \"no\" but \"**fuck no**.\" Even if you were his doctor, that would be highly, career-endingly illegal under most circumstances. For you, it's [a felony](https:\/\/law.justia.com\/codes\/arizona\/2005\/title13\/03704.html). The intent to alter his mental state is likely sufficient to establish intent to harm, and if he has any kind of bad reaction to melatonin, then the actual harm will also be used against you.\n\nIf he's an immediate danger to himself, and won't go to the hospital, call 911 and explain the situation. The police or paramedics can assess him and take him to the hospital. You can't.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm glad you're worried about him. Assuming he's not abusing stimulants, the lack of sleep and the memory problems could well be symptomatic of a number of serious neurological or psychiatric disturbances. By all means, get him the help he needs - just please don't take matters into your own hands."}

No reason to go above and beyond and talk to people or offer to clean it up - they can easily mistake kindness for guilt.  Lock your car, mention nothing of the paint, and continue with life.

{"question":"Last year around april I was arrested for being intoxicated and had Xanax found on me and some cash.

The dumb mistake was talking *at all*, not what you said.\n\n2. You don't \"look like\" a drug dealer. You *are* a drug dealer. You dealt drugs, and you confessed to it.\n\n3.

There can be nuances by state though so just ask your therapist this question before you tell them the whole storyAnswer #2: Not a lawyer, but when I discussed it with my psychiatrist (in Oregon, so rules differ), she first asked me if he had access to any other girls the age I was when the abuse happened and when I said no, that she wasn't obligated to report it.Answer #3: IANAL. It's my understanding that psychologists and such are only required to report it if it's happening to a child. Also, i could be wrong, but I believe statute of limitations in the US is seven years, so nothing will probably happen even if it was reported. Don't quote me on anything."}
{"question":"So a while ago I met this guy online, 31 year old businessman who wanted to have an arrangement with me. He said he would give me money if I came to visit him. I never did visit him nor have any intentions to, he said he was in the process of sending me money but it never came through so therefore I never accepted any money from him. Stupid, I know. He is now contacting me and saying that I was scamming him out of his money and that he is reporting me to the authorities, he says he works with NBC Comcast and is finding out information about me (my sister and sister-in-laws names) I have since blocked him on social media and text, he mentioned the Border Feds and Homeland security and my school. Is there anything I did wrong, and how should I go about this? \n","answer":" It sounds like two scammers trying to scam each other.  Best of luck to both of you.Answer #2: Reporting you to the authorities for what, exactly?

{"question":"I cut my finger good enough with a workplace appliance to have to go to an urgent Care facility. Got a tetanus shot and some stitches.

If you all still live with your parents and\/or you're a minor, you need to talk this out with your parents. You don't have the ability to charge her with anything. Only the police have that ability and they have the ability to charge anyone with any crimes they uncover during an investigation.

If your work does not require you to live in the building, this would be tenancy at will, 30 days notice required.

You can call the police if they lock you out.  \nYou can also have a locksmith get you back in.  \n\nAnswer #6: Depending on your location you could refuse to leave and force them to evict you.

{"question":"So I've been dealing with issues like depression and other things because of my circumsision that was done to me as an infant without my consent. Its is violating knowing my parents chose to do something so terrible to me when I was just a newborn. And that a doctor wouldn't honor his hippocratic oath by refusing to carry out unnecessary and inhuman acts on a child. A doctor should be current on all medical information and in 1996 when I was born there was questions going around in the medical community. Why a professional would not double check something is beyond me. So what I'm asking is is there any legal recourse, I've been searching for closure on this for 23 years, and I feel like changing law so as this could never happen to another innocent child ever would at least heal some of the wound. And maybe during the hospital and parents for doing this would help make people second guess their actions.\n","answer":" The Hippocratic oath isn't even used by medical societies, let alone the law, as it would bar doctors from performing a number of vital treatments simply because the patient is put at risk. Doctors do have legal duties to their patients, but \"first, do no harm\" is not one of them.\n\nThe question of \"can someone who was circumcised as an infant sue the doctor 20 years later as an adult\" has been comprehensively answered in just about every jurisdiction with a \"no,\" or at least \"not on that basis alone.\" If your circumcision was performed badly, you might have a case, and you should speak to a medical malpractice attorney, but if it was performed up to the standard of care, then your recourse is to be blunt with your parents that you're disappointed in how they treated you as a vulnerable infant, not in the courts.\n\nIn any case, the legal system is poorly equipped to offer closure. You'd be better off speaking to a personal counsellor for help on that front. If the law provides emotional release, it only ever does so by accident.\n\nIf you want to advocate for stronger laws against circumcision, there are a number of advocacy groups who would be glad of your help. You can also talk to your representative in the legislature yourself and make your point to them."}
{"question":"I have two roommates. My roommate “A” was dating roommate “B”. “A” stole money from and cheated on Roommate “B.”  So they broke up and “A” moved out without notifying the rental agency 4 months before our lease is supposed to end. Roommate B and I have made numerous attempts to contact this person, all which have ended up unsuccessful.  We have been covering his portion of the rent in the meanwhile. The lease will automatically go month-to-month at the end of our current lease. My roommate “B” and I want to only stay for the first month of the month-to-month lease, have given our 30-day notice to the landlord, but Because we had all three originally signed the lease, roommate “A” needs to sign the agreement that will terminate. He refuses to do so. How do we proceed?\n","answer":" Give proper notice and move out is really all you can do.\n\nThis issue comes up here every so often and there's not a super clear answer, but all your landlord can do is take you to court.  He would have to get in front of a judge and claim that you are obligated to pay rent forever because someone else failed to sign a piece of paper, which doesn't seem like a very tenable position.  If he does sue, make sure you respond."}

{"question":"A friend and I play tennis at my local park district in a suburb outside Chicago, but every time we play, we are asked to leave because we did not purchase an outdoor pass.\n\nDoes my park district have the right to charge fees for such public facilities? I assumed that tax money would cover these expenses? What could legally happen if I flat out refused to leave the court?\n\nParks districts further out don’t charge these fees, so I don’t understand why I can’t enjoy the courts at my local park district for free.\n\nAlso, could public school districts refuse access to outdoor facilities (such as tennis courts) during non-school hours?

They're free to lock it, charge fees for it, or simply refuse to let you use it, so long as those decisions are not made for legally discrimnatory reasons."}

The landlord is doing everything in their power to convince us that we need to move, but I'm not so sure. It's my understanding that the lease survives the transfer of the title in this case, since there's no specific clause in our lease about sale of the house.

{"question":"Not much else to add to the title, my 12 year old cousin's parents have purchased and allow him to publicly wear a PornHub t-shirt. We don't want to call CPS on family- just looking for advice on how to convince them legally they're in the wrong.\n","answer":" A shirt with a Pornhub company logo wouldn't be considered a pornographic shirt. Does the shirt itself actually have pornographic material on it?\n\nA logo and a sultry, but clothed, woman on the shirt, or something along those lines doesn't qualify as pornography by most, if any, statutes.Answer #2: Is the shirt itself actually pornographic? That's a major factor: there's nothing _legally_ wrong with your cousin's parents giving him a logo shirt even if the logo is for an adults-only product, but there is something legally wrong if they're actually providing him with porn.\n\nRegardless, if you have concerns and you're not happy with how the kid's parents have responded, you can talk to CPS. Keep in mind that that's a large escalation, but they will act if your cousin is in danger."}

My boss has told me that either I complete all of my calls everyday before going home or I can get another job. The problem is we are badly understaffed right now and if I do as he asks I'm not going to get home until 9, 10, 11 every single night.

{"question":"Could really use some help! Sorry about the long post....\n\nI started my restaurant in 2014 named after a common term in Seattle. Another restaurant in Maryland with the same name that started in 2008 contacted me and said to stop using the name, OR they would license the name to us. They trademarked the name in 2016. They sent us a license agreement that was only $100 a year, but had some scary wordage in there like they can still make us change the name with a 45 day notice. They said they had to send the C&amp;D to keep their trademark, and thats why its only $100. I feel like they are going to try and make me change the name as soon as I sign the contract. \n\nI talked to some lawyers and they said I could fight it, asking for geographical rights. That would cost me about $2500. Being a restaurant, we have slim margins and can't afford that.   \n\n\nAny thoughts? What happens if I just ignore it? \n\nThanks! \n","answer":" NAL and assuming you are both individual restaurants the operate in a small geographic area, not a nation\\-wide chain.\n\nPrior to them registering the trademark, you were both using using common law trademarks which would allow you, and anyone else using the name, to operate within your geographic areas, regardless of who registered it first.\n\nIn registering the mark the other restaurant now has the ability to enforce the trademark nation\\-wide. However, your lawyer is correct that if the other restaurant does not operate in your geographic area, since you were already using the mark prior to their registration, it's possible you have the right to continue using the mark within your current geographic area.\n\nIf you ignore it, the other restaurant could file a trademark infringement suit against you. If they do, you'll essentially be making the same legal argument \\(geographic rights\\) advised by the lawyer you spoke to, so it might be worth waiting to see if they follow through and take any action."}

There are tough standards to getting and keeping an FFL. In addition to being qualified to legally own a firearm, there are many ways to be denied or lose FFL status such as he \n\n* is a felon\n\n* has been convicted of any crime punishable by more than a year in prison (whether or not they were ever sentenced to or served a day in prison)\n\n* is under indictment for any crime punishable by more than a year in prison\n\n* is a fugitive\n\n* is an unlawful user of any controlled substance\n\n* has been adjudicated as a mental defective\n\n* has been committed to a mental institution\n\n* is an illegal alien\n\n* has a dishonorable discharge from the military\n\n* has renounced their U.S. citizenship\n\n* is the subject of a restraining order restraining the person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or the child of an intimate partner, or\nwho has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\n\nThat last one is probably your best bet. You should notify the police with copies of the evidence of the website and texts, file with the courts for the restraining order if you haven't already, then notify the ATF."}
{"question":"I live in Georgia, and am on a lease with my ex girlfriend.  We hit a bad patch and over the course of a weekend, all of my possessions were moved out and put in a storage unit.  What are my options, I am still on the lease and still pay rent because my name is tied to it.  Thanks in advance\n","answer":" They can't kick you out of your home.  They are not Judge Dredd.Answer #2: Go get your stuff and move back in. If she blocks you call the copsAnswer #3: Did they change the locks? Can you get back in the unit? If not talk to the police and let them let you back in. Can you get your stuff out of storage and put it back in the unit?Answer #4: NAL: If your name is still on the lease then you still have rights to the property unless they (the property manager) evict you. However, if your relationship has hit a point where her and her family are booting you out, you may just want to pack up and move along. How much longer is left on the lease? Have you tried reaching out to the property manager to get your name taken off of the lease?Answer #5: Who owns the house\/apartment? If its her family, file for an illegal eviction.Answer #6: Your option is to move back into the apartment.  She can't just kick you out.  \n\n\n&gt;Edited to ask, can I press charges on everyone involved with taking my possessions off the property?\n\nDid they promptly give you the address and key to the storage unit?  If yes, making a theft complaint is going to be a little tricky.  Perhaps we can get some other redditors with more familiarity with this type of criminal law to comment.  If no, then you have a valid theft complaint."}

{"question":"I got a ticket for going 54 in a 45, but was actually going 65. On the ticket it says 54 in the 45, and that's also what the cop told me he would reduce it to.

I'm obviously not going to fight the ticket, but I'm still going to court to hopefully get it reduced to a parking ticket (this is what the officer told me would happen).

However, if your memory falters between now and your court date, \"I don't recall, your honor,\" is a perfectly appropriate response.  I doubt you will be asked.

{"question":"My daughter is having something of a wild streak and her friends aren't exactly the best people. After leaving my son has noticed things of his have gone missing (namely things like old coins- he had no proof of purchase as he had collected them and didn't document any mint numbers, dates etc, so legal action wasn't taken.) , and they are known to smoke marijuana (which is illegal in my county but not really what I would like to focus on, though if I catch them with it in my home again I would pursue it in a legal sense.)\n\nI have asked them not to come into the home, and told them, but occasionally I have still caught them in my home. I am hesitant to call the cops\/do anything else because my daughter is inviting them into the house and I'm not sure what the interpretation of the law is  around that.

Tell the kids to stay the hell away from your house and if they do, and won't leave you call the cops immediately. On top of that you need to have a conversation with your daughter and explain to her who is the adult and who is the child.Answer #2: Tell them to leave.

{"question":"Thanks in advance for your help. I fully suspect that an ex employee is going to sue the company and I fully expect to be subpoenaed due to the fact that I'm a senior member of the company and am privy to info that most aren't. \n\nIs there something that protects me from having to testify on the grounds that it may impact my employment? \n","answer":" &gt;Is there something that protects me from having to testify on the grounds that it may impact my employment? \n\nNope. If you're sworn in, and you're asked a question that isn't successfully objected to, you must tell the truth. If you don't, you'll be committing perjury which is a crime. \n\nYour company's attorney should be walking you through this. You should share your concerns with them, through appropriate channels (e.g., your management chain). \n\nIf your employer takes action against you because you gave honest testimony under oath, you will likely have a course of action against them.\n\nAnd if you are subpoenaed, some general tips: Answer each question with as few words as possible. \"Yes\" and \"No\" and \"I don't recall\" (if you honestly don't recall, don't play games) are the best answers. If the question is a rambling bumble-fuck or can be answered in multiple ways, ask if the question can be restated. And trust your company's attorney to object to questions that are out of bounds -- don't jump at giving answers, let the opposing side ask the question, look at the attorney on your side, breathe, and then, if no objection is forthcoming, answer the question in as few words as possible. It's not your job to object or debate or justify, nor is it for you in your role as giver of testimony to take things personally or get emotional -- just answer the questions like a robot would. Answer #2: I've seen employment agreements that say I won't testify against my employer. I've just assumed they are trash that wouldn't stand up at all. Although I wonder if there would be some way that they could sue me to recover damages for my testimony."}

{"question":"There was a terrible story over the weekend about a pregnant woman (age 23) that was murdered by her husband (age 30) in MN, and it got me thinking about what is going to happen to their children (both under 6-7 years old, I believe).

If they pass 10 bills a session does each bill cost more than if they passed 20?  \n\nAre you counting costs just up until passage, or after as well? There are far more costs associated with implementing the law than there is in passing it.  Are you also counting the funding earmarks in the law?  "}

{"question":" \nI know someone who passed away in January. This persons brother had notified SS but they have still been depositing checks into that persons account. The thing is no one has access to that account, no PIN, no SS number, so Social security keeps putting money in every month.\nI've heard cases of Social Security putting money into accounts and sending checks for years and in one case even 10 years after the person died.\nI was reading one article where a guy reported his moms death and they still sent checks 4 years after she died.\nIf social security eventually wisens up and realizes that they've been depositing money into said deceased persons account, how can they get it back?\nThe money is just sitting in that account and accumulating every month, as no one has access to the account. How would SS get the money out?\n","answer":" Social Security will make a claim against the estate of the person who died, and the executor of the estate will be responsible for repaying the money, assuming the estate still has assets.  I don't necessarily believe that Social Security has been notified, as they are generally very quick to want repayment of excess funds.  "}
{"question":"We're gay men and married. We want to buy a house and our chosen place is in an HOA. The HOA's bylaws say it's a single family area. The definition of the single family in the bylaws includes a wide range of relationships (parent, child, sibling, grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, etc) and \"married husband and wife\" rather than \"married couple.\" Figure to comply gives the HOA the right to impose a $100 fine per day per non-family member living at the property. \n\nOur realtor says this is nothing to worry about since it was probably written this way years ago, but this a rather new HOA (less than 5 years old).\n\nCan they enforce this law and evict\/fine us if we end up buying this house?

{"question":"Hey guys\nSunday, I was at the park with my dog. A large dog walked in, and while he was still on a leash, attacked another dog and my own. My dog is waking up from getting sedated and getting stitches in his ear. The other owner's dog came out a little better, only one bite. She didn't have to take him to the vet.\nThe owner of the dog ran away after, saying, \"I'm not paying for your fucking vet bills. Put some iodine on it.\" Thankfully, two others chased down the guy and got his information for us.\nDo you have any experience dealing with dog attacks? In my opinion, he needs to reimburse me the $300 I paid for the medicine and procedure. I've got a picture of his driver's license, but I'm not sure how to approach him. I've also got the names and phone numbers of three witnesses who saw everything and how this dog attacked mine and the other.

You should report it to the police ASAP, and to animal control if they don't care. \n\nYou're absolutely right that he should be liable for the $300.

{"question":"So this past week my neighbors had a tree removed from their yard.  The company that cut the tree down had it land in my yard killing most of the grass and causing it rip large holes all through out the yard.  They also cut up the tree in my yard and drove a dozer through my yard to clear up the debris.  The dozer tore up more of the yard and left tracks.  Do I have any legal backing in this.

I took pictures of them in my yard as I left for work one morning with the company truck in the background.  \nTopic:\nReal Estate law\n","answer":" Your main beef will be with the tree company.Answer #2: IANAL, but I have a similar story that happened to my aunt. She called an arborist to trim a tree branch that was overhanging her gutter.

They set up an appointment and the day of, a subcontractor and crew came to take down the branch. They made a huge mess, left debris all over her yard and dented the gutter where the branch hit it as it fell.

Answer #3: No reason to cause tension between neighbours when it wasn't their fault. Go after the tree company. I'm an agent. Very unlikely that they don't have liability insurance ($1mil), so plenty for your situation. File a claim or ask if they want to pay out of pocket. Recently had a relatives yard torn up badly by movers tractor trailer truck getting into the yard. They opted to pay out of pocket cash. Quickly.

{"question":"edit: For clarification, this took place in Ohio.\n\nThe restaurant she works at has a \"policy\" where if a table walks out, the server taking care of them is required to pay the price of the food they ordered. It's never been an issue because they have never seemed to enforce it in the past, but the day after she turned in her notice of leave she had a table walk out. Sure enough, the general manager forced her to pay half of her tips claiming that it was her responsibility, and not the company's. \n\nLater on during the shift, she ended up walking out because they were keeping her after hours to do some menial task. I'm hoping that her quitting during the shift won't screw us over too bad, but I'm looking for any options that we might have. We don't exactly have a ton of money for a lawyer, me being a student and her being a server, but I feel that we need to do something about this.

I don't live in OH, but google should tell you whom to call. They will help you determine if there was a violation and you can report the violation if there was one.

I went through the standard sobriety test walking in a straight line and then keeping my balance on one foot for 30 seconds. The officer ended up telling one of my friends that I passed my sobriety test but had reason to believe I was intoxicated so I had to do a breathalyzer test.

Patients don't differentiate between supportive yelling and angry yelling, and all you do when you counter protest is add to the crowds\/noise\/commotion outside the clinics. It seems like it's helping, but it's not. If you want to do something meaningful, volunteer as a clinic escort. These folks don't engage with protesters, but they help escort patients from their cars into the building and distract patients from what protesters are yelling.

{"question":"Ok, this post isn't for me, but my wife's cousin and his wife. They were hit by a drunk driver on Cinco De Mayo(Go figure) he broke part of his back and was helicoptered into the hospital and ended having surgery. She broke her leg, no surgery just a brace. The guy who hit them had insurance, but just liability. They had full coverage. Between the two insurances they are only getting paid $120,000($60,000 from each essentially). Almost half of which is the value of their totaled 2016 Yukon. I have no skin in the game but just despise people getting screwed over. Don't they deserve more?! If so how would they go about getting it and from whom?!?\n","answer":" They deserve to be made whole for their injuries and any other damages stemming from the accident. If the insurance payout was insufficient, their option is to sue the drunk driver directly, but if the guy cannot bear that financial burden, they aren't likely to see a dime of any damages. "}
{"question":"So while looking through my mail today, I found an envelope mailed to me from a company I've never heard of in a state I've never visited. Upon opening it, I found two checks with my full name and address on them that together add up to several thousand dollars. The account that the money was coming from is registered to a completely unrelated company in yet another state that I've never visited before. I'm assuming the checks were sent to me in error, but the fact that I live thousands of miles away from both companies and they still got both my name and address correct is a little weird and scary. Do I have any legal claim to the money? Would just cashing\/depositing the checks and going on with my life open me up to fraud charges?\n","answer":" This is a variant on one of the most common scams in the country. This isn't an error, you're a mark."}
{"question":"I normally check my CR once a year, but forgot last year, so when I did check it just a couple weeks ago, I found a judgement in the local county court for $1,100 against me from my landlord\/management corporation, \"settled\" May 2014.

I was never subpoenaed, never contacted, but the very limited info I can find online about the case has an affidavit listed as well by some unfamiliar man, noting that he's served in the military. What does that have to do with my case, and how do I go about finding out exactly what this is about?

He and I have no written agreement about him living in the house and he has lived with me and paid me rent and contributed to utilities for the past year. I've already explained my situation and asked him to move out in 30 days (verbally), but I feel I should do more to avoid complications if he decides to refuse to leave. How do I legally request that he move out and keep this process as painless as possible? \n","answer":" You need to give the roommate a 30 day (on month) notice to vacate that is written.  You want to put the date of the notice and the date you want them out.\n\nIf they do not, you need to go through the legal process of eviction.  \n\nAlternatively, you can make a cash offer for the roommate to leave earlier.  A \"cash for keys\" where you give them $X in exchange for the keys to move out.  You want this agreement in writing as well."}

I called the provider and they confirmed my name is no where on the account although my cc is attached to it, and I called my bank who marked all the charges as fraud and are going to credit my account.

Your ex will likely feel some heat, though.Answer #2: If your bank has marked it as fraud already, that should be all that's needed from you.  A Fraud Investigator will likely contact you soon and verify your story and that you did not authorize this purchase.\n\nYou should cancel your CC and have a new one issued.  There's nothing to stop him from trying to do something dumb if he already has the number.  Yes, he'll face consequences, but it'll still make your life tougher if he does something malicious.

{"question":"Like the title says. I don't understand how this could be enforceable. Would this be part of a settlement? Like, \"We promise to drop the lawsuit if you promise to erase all copies\"?\n\nIf the music video is clearly parody or satire but is legitimate piece of art that stands on its own merit, wouldn't it be fair use? It even has a disclaimer stating no affiliation or endorsement by the copyright owner why would an artist make such a concession?\n","answer":" Copyright law allows the owner of a work to control how it is distributed, and ordering unauthorized copies destroyed is consistent with that right. Technically, the courts in that case only had the ability to impose that order on the parties to the suit, and not on the general public, but anyone else distributing it would also be violating the owner's copyrights and could, in turn, face their own lawsuit.\n\nIt's unlikely New Line will sue random redditors, but a DMCA takedown would also be appropriate, should they choose to enforce his right to control distribution of his work.\n\n&gt; It even has a disclaimer stating no affiliation or endorsement by the copyright owner\n\nA disclaimer like this is merely an admission that you are infringing on the owner's rights.

{"question":"As title says. She works in a corporate office for a television company in Los Angeles. She has worn smaller items, like earrings, with the Playboy logo on them, but has been told by other people that she could get fired if she wears a shirt or hat or jacket that had the logo on it. When she told me this, I laughed. I don't have a problem with her love for Playboy, and it's not like she's ever been featured in the magazine. She loves it, but doesn't ever want to pose nude herself. I told her if she got fired, for simply wearing something with a logo, she would probably have grounds to sue. I know rules for corporate offices can be different, but is this something she should actually be worried about? \n","answer":" She can absolutely be fired for wearing a shirt with that logo on it.  She could be fired for wearing a blue shirt on Monday.  There are no protections for the Playboy logo.Answer #2: Your adult girlfriend seriously needs to be told that it’s not appropriate to wear a porn logo tshirt in a corporate environment? Unless she works for Playboy, yes, she can and will get fired for that. Answer #3: &gt; I told her if she got fired, for simply wearing something with a logo, she would probably have grounds to sue. \n\nYou are 110% incorrect. \n\nAnswer #4: If she gets fired for wearing the logo she has exactly a zero percent chance of winning a legal case against the company.Answer #5: Absent an employment contract or membership in a union, her employer is free to fire her for wearing logos they find unprofessional. This is especially true of logos which have an explicit or sexual connotation, like Playboy (I wouldn't expect BRAZZERS logos to go over well either) and the employer can legitimately argue are inappropriate in a professional setting.   She would not have grounds to sue, but she would likely have grounds to collect unemployment if she was fired for a first offense.  Answer #6: In an at-will employment scenario, yes, they can fire her for this (or virtually any other reason).\n\n&gt; I told her if she got fired, for simply wearing something with a logo, she would probably have grounds to sue. \n\nYou're right that she can sue.

We've been together 4 years and our boy is 3. We've lived in the same house for those 4 years. \n","answer":" File for emergency custody. You may need to go to a magistrate. Since you don't know her whereabouts and cannot verify your child is okay, you may be able to get temporary emergency custody...especially since she didn't take anything with her.\n\nThis protects your rights and your child's rights. It's not adversarial and you're not doing it to punish her. You just don't know her frame of mind and it's your duty to ensure your child is protected. \n\nI would not just drop things either if she comes back. If you do she could disappear. This isn't okay when you have a child together.Answer #2: This isn't just a legaladvice question but also something for relationships. She's not going to come back when she mentally working things out. Not only are you going to have to file for custody but I would also recommend looking for a counselor. One that does couples and maybe another for your kiddo. They are going to be confused after all of this because you don't know what fiancé has been telling them.Answer #3: This happened with a friend of mine, but she was the one leaving.

I ask because one of my relatives passed away a few years ago and his mother, the executor of his estate, had a very similar situation happen with the lawyer she was using.  He was charging excessive fees and kept canceling meetings at the last second. She ultimately reported him to the state bar association and he miraculously got his act together.

Nothing illegal about the picture. Talk to your daughter if you don't like how she is dressed. Answer #2: &gt;  I don't think it's appropriate for pictures of an almost-naked minor to be on the internet\n\nWhat you think is \"appropriate\" is only relevant in terms of things you have control over. This isn't one of them. No laws are being broken, and if the pictures were taken in public he has every right to post them.Answer #3: So, your daughter's within spitting distance of being an adult, and of being responsible for herself without your help. What does she think about this situation?Answer #4: *Disclaimer - not a lawyer*\n\nGenerally, you don't have the expectation of privacy in a public place. You can wander around with a camera and take pictures of public places that happen to have people in them\n\nAs a sidenote, it's unlikely they were aware your daughter is a minor. \n\nSure, the considerate thing to do might have been to remove the picture, but inconsiderate =\/= illegal. Legally, the blogger doesn't have to do anything.  Answer #5: That depends on where she was when the picture was taken. If she was in a public place when the picture was taken, then she had no reasonable expectation to privacy. \n\nIf you\/she don't want people seeing her dressed like that, then don't go into public dressed like that."}

{"question":"About six months-ago I made an agreement with a friend of mine. He told me he would make payments on my bike for three months until he had the money to buy if outright.

Failing to make the last two payments is not the same as stealing it.\n\nYou can sue him for the remaining amount owed. If the remaining balance is under $10,000, you would sue him in small claims. You do not need a lawyer in small claims court. It's best if you have a written agreement, but you could still win without one of you convince the judge an oral agreement exists. Bring any records you have of the payments that have been made and when.Answer #2: Be very careful about your warnings.  \"Pay me or I'm calling the cops\" is a bad look.Answer #3: You said you would report the bike stolen. Does that mean the bike is still in your name, if so go repossess it.Answer #4: Did you sign over the title to him already?Answer #5: Sue him in small claims for the balance owed. Don’t report it stolen.Answer #6: I had the exact same thing happen to me with a motorcycle. I decided that pursuing the matter for several hundred dollars was not worth the time and energy of filing paperwork and courts and taking days off of work so I wrote if off as a hard lesson in business dealings with friends and moved on. I was eventually able to buy the new bike I wanted, it just took a little longer to gather the funds.

{"question":"Hi everyone, before you think I'm like a bad person please hear me out.\n\nI'm a 23 year old who lives in the California ,and I met this girl at a music event who claimed was 19. We had sex and I even got her pregnant because the contraceptive failed. Fortunately we got an abortion, however the girl still wants to be with me (daddy issues) She won't leave me alone. I tried breaking up with her multiple times but it never works. She even threatened to report me for having sex with a minor if I leave her. \n\nShe's turning 18 in like 5 months and I was hoping when she's 18 I can break things and leave her for good.\n\nMy main concern is that can she report me for statutory rape or anything even if I wait until she's 18?\n","answer":" Of course. The crime was committed at the time you had sex."}
{"question":"My wife had announced she was pregnant when hired. Got the job. And she was told she can’t file for maternity leave because she hasn’t been with the company. It will just unpaid time off. Jump to 2 months later, 3 weeks after giving birth, she gets a call from HR claiming job abandonment and they need the laptop back, and that she should have filed for medical leave. But no one told her about medical leave during the process. Nor did her boss tell her at any point even when she called in saying she was in labor. Boss even came to hospital room to see the baby. And she would text my wife checking in on her. Wife is a nurse. They have a good case? \n","answer":" I mean, did she tell them how much time she’d be taking off in advance?"}
{"question":"I have to drive a lot for work so I have a company car. My employment contract doesn't say anything about this but my car got scraped while parked in a parking structure and the car left. I reported the incident and my boss says that since I'm in charge of the car and the \"Captain of the Ship\" that the insurance deductible would be my responsibility. It sounds like BS to me but I don't know any official way to rebut it. Is he right?\n","answer":" Ok first off, when you say 'my company car', who actually owns it? Who is on the registration, insurance policy, etc?Answer #2: Was it being used for business\/company purposes at the time?"}
{"question":"Hello, I'm writing this on behalf of my friend. They are a host at a restaurant in CA, and found that the other day, the contents of their wallet went missing, including $100 cash, and 3 gift cards of approximate value of another $100.\n\nOnly one other host was working at the same time as my friend was, and that coworker is suspected of being the thief, as my friend saw the coworker rummaging through where they put their possessions under the premise of \"cleaning\". \n\nOthers have also had their things go missing at the same time this particular coworker has been working. This coworker has also been caught snorting cocaine inside the restaurant, which did not result in any action. \n\nMy questions is: Is there anything my friend can do about this coworker?\n","answer":" &gt;Is there anything my friend can do about this coworker?\n\nFile a report with the police and let them investigate.  Barring any actual proof of the theft, it is slim that any arrest or conviction will be forthcoming.  \n\nUnless the area that the staff stores their property is under lock and key\/video surveillance, there will be no real way to prove that the co-worker stole the wallet.\n\n*spelling"}
{"question":"As the title says, my sister tried to kill herself yesterday and she was taken to the ER by paramedics. We aren't sure what she took, but they were able to revive her on scene. Cops came, told us she was being admitted under the Baker Act. No one can get any info on her condition or status. My question is where do we go from here, and how do we find out where she is or is being transferred to? Because of hippa, the nurses won't even tell us if she's been seen by a psychiatrist yet. So lost. Any advise Please? \n","answer":" You are just going to have to wait it out. There is nothing you can do until she is released.Answer #2: If she's an adult there is nothing you can do. If so I would ask one of the nurses \"i know you Can't confirm or deny if she is even a patient but if so please ask her to call\" then you can ask her to sign a release of information. If she is minor it shouldn't be a problem for the legal guardian to get info "}
{"question":"I live in a trailer park in Wisconsin. In our lease it states that the lot lords are the ones responsible for tree care. There is a very large soft maple tree in my neighbors yard (my neighbor's house has been vacant for a few years). This tree has one large branch that is starting to crack and die that is extended over my home. There is also another smaller branch that is scrapping my roof. Since August of 2017, I have been asking them to cut down or at least trim these branches off to prevent damage to my roof\/house. I'd prefer the whole thing to be removed personally. I've been told many times that this will be taken care of, but still nothing has been. The last time was about a month ago, and they said that someone come within two weeks to trim anything hanging over the house and still nothing. What are my options?\n","answer":" **IANAL** but *if it was* me I would send them snail mail notification of this hazard and do so via certified mail with a signed receipt requested.  I would include a copy of the lease with the relevant information highlighted.   \nThis way you have proof that they were notified of the danger and if it should cause damage they will bear the financial responsibility. Otherwise if they claim they didn't know it would be an act of God and your insurance would be responsible.  \n\nThey know these things and often a formal notification is enough to prompt them to deal with it."}

{"question":"Hi, I moved into a Irvine company property on Feb 2016, was evicted on April 2016 because I had unregistered guest. I moved out before eviction. My rent was paid in front for Feb to April 2016. I moved out on April 15th.\n\nToday I received a phone call from a collector saying I own rent to Irvine company because we still have a lease, so they can charge me rent for the remain lease period from May 2016 to Jan 2017, which is more than $30,000.\n\nHow does this happen? \nI really cannot afford a lawyer, so I can only come here to ask. \nWhat should I do?\n","answer":" It sounds like you moved out before you were actually evicted (on paper). Were you served 30 days notice? Did you receive an actual eviction? The formal eviction voids the lease. Not moving out.\n\nIf your LL just said I'll evict you, and you left without actually being evicted, then your lease was still intact. In that case, you do in fact owe the remaining rent. You have to pay the rent on an apartment you lease even if you aren't residing there."}
{"question":"Tell me where to post this please, if not accepted here.\n","answer":" While this is not the right place, I'm not sure what place is because it's unclear what your exact question is. Are you asking how Social Security calculates the benefits that they provide? Or are you asking more in a political sense, e.g. why do our laws cause this to happen?"}
{"question":"So the simple version, if the law has an enactment clause stating it goes into effect January 1 2020, does it go into effect at midnight in your time zone, or is there a standard time zone used for this? I couldn't find any discussion of this when I searched a bit for it...\n\nAnd for a more complex hypothetical, assuming it is the local time zone that governs, how would that effect an aircraft in flight? Suppose you have a flight from NY to LA, and depart 11pm in NY. 90 minutes later, over the central timezone, it is now 11:30pm 12\/31\/19, in NY it is now 12:30am 1\/1\/20, and you commit the act being made illegal, the flight then lands in LA at 2am 1\/1\/20.\n","answer":" For federal law any laws enacted with a time specific activation is pressumed to be active at midnight (00:00 onna 24 hour clock) eastern standard time since that is Washington DCs time zone."}
{"question":"So around 2 months ago I bought a watch on craigslist. I spent 200$ on the jaunt. After a few days i realized it was kind of a waste of money and decided to sell it. I went up to one of the stands in my local mall and sold it to the stand. The owner took down all of my info. A few days ago I get a voicemail from the guy saying the watch is fake and he wants his money back. I for one already spent the money he gave me ($120) and two dont think that after 2 months its fair.

{"question":"I am a 17 year old, my boss is working me 80 hours a week, I asked for hours before, meaning a little bit of over time (50-55 hours), and my boss told me to get my mother to sign a paper saying that I can work more then 40 hours a week, and the only reason I haven't reported him to wage and labor is because I am afraid that me or my mother could be fined or punished for me working so many hours, when I only every wanted a few more hours. My question is will I as the employee, or my mother be punished if I report my boss for working me, and other minors for over 40 hours a week, no breaks, and no off days?\n","answer":" I'm NAL but I imagine that your mother could retract her permission for you to work in excess of 40 hrs per week as you are a minorAnswer #2: Is he paying you overtime (1.5 x hourly pay rate) for all hours over 40 in the week? If not, keep detailed track of your hours and file a wage claim with DOL once you find a new job.Answer #3: Have you tried just telling him you can only do the 50 hours? Your employer doesn't have unilateral say over how much you work, you absolutely have a say. He can fire you over the hours. And you can quit over the hours. \n\n\nAs for the breaks if he is literally not allowing any at all then you can and should report him for that. But make sure you have asked to take a break at some point.\n\nYou and your mom wont get in trouble with the state for reporting any violation."}
