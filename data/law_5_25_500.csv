law,"[Australia] Can Americans from America and as American as apple pie, own houses in Washington D.C?.I'm asking since in the Australian Capital Territory citizens don't purchase property per se, they can only buy leases to the land that last up to 99 years. Once the leases expire, you've got to purchase the lease again.

Since Canberra and Washington D.C were both planned capitals of interstatual colonial federations, I'm wondering if and how the property laws differ (or if they're the same)."
law,"How do small-town and small-city lawyers avoid conflicts of interest?.How do rural, small town, or even attorneys in smallish cities that aren't near larger cities avoid conflicts of interest? It would seem that it wouldn't take long for those to develop with a small pool of potential clients."
law,"What speed do you officers drive?.Like driving on the highway or residential, do you go 4-7 over like everyone else on the residential or keep it steady right on the limit? I've always wanted to know. I've been on a couple ride-alongs but always forget to look at the speed."
law,"Anyone with Michigan State Police.Hey, I'm going through the MSP hiring process, and I'd like some more information about what to expect in the interview.  Maybe some specific questions or what they'd like to see in my answers. "
law,"Refused to speak to the police after an officer got assaulted. Did I break the law?.I witnessed a police officer being assaulted in a nightclub on Tuesday. I don’t like the police and so when they were stopping people to check for witnesses I said first “no comment” and then later “I don’t speak to the police.”

I know lying to the police is an offence, but can you refuse to help them with their enquiries on the grounds that you don’t want to?"
