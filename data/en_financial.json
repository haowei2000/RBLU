{"question":"Honest question.\n\nWhere is all the money?  I hear nothing but bad news about financial crisis all over the world, and it seems that there is a shortage of cash - like it is some sort of natural resource.\n\nPeople haven't stopped buying stuff.  They still need food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Taxes are still collected. Fines are still levied. \n\nSo where is all the money?  I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \n\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?","answer":"(relix already hit on some of this)\n\nIt's hard to explain this to a five-year-old, because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes... \n\nAll actual \"money\" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don't argue with me yet, I'll get to that.)\n\nImagine a pretend world with no money, some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let's invent paper money. You can't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff, because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let's walk through this...\n\n- Let's say you're an apple-farmer and I'm a hunter. You want some meat but haven't harvested your crops yet. You say to me, \"hey, go hunt me some meat and I'll give you 1\/10th of my apple harvest in the fall\". Fair enough, I give you meat, you owe me apples. There's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard \"prices\" start to emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever. \n\n- Now, let's say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  \"Hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?\" You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like money. \n\n- In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman who doesn't even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish, because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time, you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest. \n\nNow, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples. The \"money\" is a transferable IOU-- your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and it's transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere. \n\nSo far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here, on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we'll address separately:\n\n- What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn't \"go\" anywhere, it's just gone, it doesn't exist. Real value was genuinely destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value-- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed. (We'll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting). \n\n- The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay, and the town wouldn't find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has been \"destroyed\" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.\n\nThe above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests. \n\nAfter the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer. Let's say the town potato-farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some murkier system. Similarly, the town drunk probably won't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold. \n\nNow we have something like a credit market emerging, and the potato-farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern \"bond\"...\n\n(continued in a reply to this post...)\n\n"}

{"question":"If my underlying assumption is incorrect, please elucidate me. \n\nThat said, I know of several family members who worked as grocers and retail workers and they were able to buy their homes in the 70s and eventually paid them off. \n\nI, on the other hand, have a well-paying job, a graduate degree, and I’m also married to a partner with a great job. \n\nYet, had it not been for inheriting the equity from my grocer and retail worker relatives, I would never have been able to affordably buy my townhouse. \n\nIn contrast, similarly sized 2 or 3 bedroom apartments for rent in my area are now priced at about $3,500 a month.

And in that regard, people spend less of their disposable income on mortgages than they did at any prior point in the last 40 years.\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/MDSP\n\nThat doesn't mean houses haven't become more expensive, but that perception is in large parts fueled by the fact that they have become a *lot* more expensive in the most desirable places, the big cities that offer high salaries and a high standard of living. People talk about San Francisco, not Casper, Wyoming.\n\nAnother thing to note is that people became wealthier and in turn bought bigger houses. Houses cost more, houses *per square foot* have fluctuated, but not gone up so drastically.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.aei.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/houses2.jpg?x91208\n\nTwo trends are worth noting however.\n\nPeople on average go to college more often, spend more time on their education, and start working later. They also get married later. This means that even if they ultimately earn the same or more, this happens later in life.\n\nAlso, inequality pushes ownership rates down for the lower half and up for the upper half.\n\nFor more details, see:\n\nhttps:\/\/equitablegrowth.org\/a-generational-perspective-on-recent-u-s-homeownership-divergence-by-income-and-race\/\n\nSo, from a broad perspective, ownership hasn't changed, but who can afford what and where has changed."}

{"question":"\nHear me out. The airline industry has asked for $50bn in support to avoid bankrupty.

{"question":"I’d like to invest in something that would generate $30000 a year. Would like to entertain as many options as possible. How about some ideas. Thank you","answer":"$30K from $700K is a 4.2% SWR (safe withdrawal rate). This is well within the 4% threshold describe by the [Trinity Study](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trinity_study). I.e. you can start by taking out $30K the first year. The next year, you adjust the $30K for inflation and take that out. There is a 95% chance your money will last and a very good chance it will actually grow.\n\nThe Trinity Study used a time horizon of 30 years. Your life expectancy at 68 is 16m\/18f but you have to allow that you could live longer. \n\nA key decision though is how to allocate your money between stocks and bonds. Typical advice might be 60\/40 or 50\/50. The problem is that bonds are now at a historically low rate.\n\nA second issue is that the equity market [CAPE Shiller Ratio](https:\/\/www.multpl.com\/shiller-pe) is currently very high. This indicates that equities may be over valued and that the market is due for a correction. The further implication is that you face a larger chance for a [sequence of returns risk](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/sequence-risk.asp).\n\nThe other realistic option you have is to purchase an annuity. Just off the top of my head, I believe you could get an annuity which would return even more than the amount you want to spend each year. The problem is that the annuity probably would not be inflation adjusted.\n\nSchwab offers a fixed immediate income calculator here: https:\/\/www.schwab.com\/annuities\/fixed-income-annuity-calculator\n\nI get a rough estimate of 42K \/ year for a the situation you describe assuming you are a male.

If inflation went to 0% next month and stayed there it would take *several years* for the Fed to get back to it's intended price-level path.\n\nThis leads us to the current problems. The Fed must raise interest rates to counter inflation. It must contract the money supply or at least stop it from expanding further. Raising interest rates is contractionary. It will raise interest costs and deter investment spending.\n\nThis affects the stock market in three inter-related ways. Firstly, companies can borrow less to expand, which affects their growth prospects. Secondly, stock speculators can borrow less to buy shares (margin loan interest rises). Thirdly, bonds become a relatively more attractive investment compared to stocks. (Notice, that only the first effect -probably the weakest one- applies to the wider economy.)\n\nWhen thinking about the US stock market you must remember that it has already declined a great deal. The S&amp;P500 peaked at 4818.62 on Jan 4th this year. Looking just now it is at 3742.23, that's a fall of 22.3%. Has the stock-market fallen far enough, or has it fallen too far? I have my own opinions about that, but conventional economics does not give an answer."}

{"question":"Hello, \nAmerican here. Astounded at how much the pound dropped vs USD after Liz Truss’ and Kwasi Kwarteng’s speeches on tax cuts and breaks. \nImo multinationals listed in London should perform better on paper because of the decreased tax burden and oversees sales (in USD) should bolster balance sheets, however I’m curious what others thing!","answer":"Economist here. The main problem is that the budget was basically a gamble. The tax cuts weren’t funded and rely on economic growth to make up the reduced tax revenue. Economic growth isn’t forecast to be very good in the short term and the UK has a low medium to long term growth forecast when compared to other developed economies. This means that there is a strong chance that the UK government will need to borrow money to pay for it. High borrowing isn’t always negative but if this happens there isn’t anything to show for it. If borrowing was high to, say, invest in renewable energy infrastructure, then the lower energy costs in the future offset the borrowing. The markets can’t see what the benefit is here. It may work and it may stimulate the economy but it is strange timing with interest rates working against it at the same time.  \n  \nTaking my economist’s hat off for a second, my colleagues are all of the opinion that the new government is displaying economic illiteracy and that in itself is fuelling the negative sentiment. I can’t comment on this though."}

{"question":"Maybe I'm missing something but printing dozens of trillions USD out of thin air in order to buy junk bonds and bail out every major company that is about to fail should have some major concequences right?

That bartender buys a $1 drink from the deli. That deli owner uses that $1 dollar to buy something, and so on and so forth.\n\nA while lot of people are going to say they made $1. Total income from that $1 will exceed one dollar since that same dollar was used over and over again.  \n\nBut if I think, “oh, I might need this dollar later” and stick it in my sock drawer, all those transactions won’t happen. Economic activity falls. Incomes fall. Prices may even decrease as everyone on that chain of economic activity saw their income fall when I broke the chain by stuffing the money in my sock drawer. \n\nIf the Fed goes out and buys something for $1, the hope is it’ll start the same chain of economic activity my $1 did. \n\nBut the bar is closed. So it skips step one and goes and buys the drink at the deli.  But no one is shopping much, so that deli owner doesn’t want to buy stuff either, so they just stuff it in their sock drawer.\n\nSo now the Fed has to introduce another dollar in hopes of starting up the chain. But everyone just keeps sticking them in their sock drawers. \n\nYes, sure, there’s tons more dollars, but they’re not being used. \n\n$1 being used 5 times is the same as 5 one dollar bills used once each before being stuffed in the sock drawer. In both cases it’s $5 worth of transactions. Since it’s the same dollar amount funding the same number of transactions, prices aren’t going to go up. \n\nThe potential problems come later when people start spending normally and everyone busts open their sock drawers and all those dollars that had gone unused start competing with each other to buy stuff. \n\nMe, the deli owner, everyone pulls out their dollar and start bidding up the price of things. \n\nThat’s when inflation would happen.\n\nAnd the Fed’s idea is that, at this point, it starts selling all the stuff it bought when it introduced those dollars, and does so until those dollars are removed from the economy, and it’l returns back to how things were at the beginning.\n\nThat’s the goal. That’s the hope. \n\nIt doesn’t always work though. That may not be able to undo it and we’ll see the inflation. \n\nor people never bust open their sock drawers, and so no matter how often the Fed prints more and more money, nothing happens. \n\nIn fact, if people keep stuffing them in sock drawers faster than the fed can print them, the number of dollars being used could actually decrease and lead to deflation. \n\nThat’s essentially what happened to Japan in the 1990s. They kept printing and printing and saying, “your goddamn sock drawers are overflowing with cash! Go use it!” But since no one was using it, prices kept falling. Problem is, if prices keep falling, the incentive is to hold off on buying, which means even more reason to keep it money stashed in the drawer, and the cycle perpetuates. No amount of money printing will cause inflation if no one uses the money.  Stacks of in your money in sock drawer isn’t any more inflationary than your socks are. It only becomes inflationary when you spend it. \n\nThe real world is more complicated, but the general idea is the same. It’s not just how much money there is, but also whether or not (and how frequently) that money is being used for transactions that matters. \n\nSo, in the end, if activity normalizes and they can unwind, no inflation. If they they can’t unwind, inflation. If activity doesn’t normalize, potentially deflation."}

I think Maldives is pretty boring though, St Barth offers a much more rounded paradise island experience IMO. Some argue that the CB is the best hotel on St Barth, I’d go for Eden Rock though.\n\nDo some classics, go to Paris and stay at George V. Go spend a week at FS Cap Ferrat. Spend another week relaxing in Park Hotel Vitznau before heading to MO Lake Como. Spend another week or two at FS Florence before heading to Rome for a private Vatican tour.

Cheval Blanc is probably full already.\n\nAs far as travel advisors go, I’ll paste my previous comment below. A lot of the stuff about travel agency bookings being good value probably isn’t relevant to you but if you want the best of the best advising you, these are the right people.\n\nI could write so much about this, at this point my travel agent\/concierge service handles most aspects of my day-to-day life.\n\nI've been using [Berkeley Travel](http:\/\/berkeleytravel.co.uk), a London based agency offering services globally. They charge no fees for travel, just take the standard commissions properties offer to travel agencies. However, because of this they're not really interested in clients with annual travel budgets below 250k.\n\nIs it worth it? Absolutely. For years I used to book directly, but reading Flyertalk I eventually realised that I could save tons of money booking through somebody who has more negotiating power than me. Good agents will have contracted rates and partnership agreements with top properties, offering huge discounts and guaranteed upgrades.\n\nFor example, Berkeley is a Four Seasons preferred partner and they've managed to arrange incredible (even triple category) upgrades at multiple Four Seasons properties for me.\n\nMoney isn't the most important thing though, it's just the convenience of all of it. Before I had my PA handling my bookings for me, she's incredible but she's just not a luxury travel specialist. She'll fight for me, but she hasn't actually visited the properties I want. She's got no problem spending hours on the phone, but doesn't have direct contacts at the properties or restaurants I want to book. \n\nThe agency I work with has me in a Whatsapp group with a bunch of people able to provide expert advice within a couple of minutes. And because they actually go to the same destinations as I do, they tend to have direct lines for restaurant managers, maitre d's, etc - often enabling them to get me last minute tables even at super busy places.\n\nOverall, I think the most important thing is to avoid the big shops. The big ones like essentialist, mrandmrssmith and velocity black are all a disaster.

{"question":"From what I've read house prices being high and rapidly increasing is a good sign they may crash. I've read this in property investment guides and online about timing the cycle. Everywhere I look seems to assume that property prices will continue to rise well into the 2040s!\n\nNow I've read the average baby boomer will die in 2034, which will create a buyers market but no analysts from property firms or banks seem to agree. My sneaking suspicion is that they are wealthy and benefit from increasing house prices and wouldn't want anyone to know the party has to end eventually.","answer":"Your question seems to be entirely focused on \"the hosing market\" in the United States, so I'm only going to speak to that. \n\nThe suggestion that \"no one\" thinks the housing market will \"crash\" is just wrong.  There are plenty of people who think that. But even though home prices have risen quickly over the past year, the idea that there will be a \"crash\" is dubious. \n\nYes, real estate can be used as an asset like stocks, silver, gold, bitcoin, etc., all of which saw dramatic increases in the last year. But unlike bitcoin, which only has value if people agree it has value, a house is also a consumable (i.e. a place to live).  So while bitcoin could crash to $0, real estate wouldn't \"crash\" in the same way because it has an inherent, useful value.\n\nLooking at real estate specifically, there are (at least) three factors  driving the increase in home prices:\n\n1. Mortgage rates are [near record lows](http:\/\/www.freddiemac.com\/pmms\/pmms30.html). When we \"[reduce the interest rates faced by households\" that will \"push prices up](https:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/cgfs64.pdf).\" That is, when mortgage rates go down a person can afford a home with a higher sticker price because their overall monthly mortgage payment stays the same.\n2. The supply of houses for sale (relative to the demand for houses) is also [near record lows](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/MSACSR). When there's less supply to meet the demand, you're going to see price increases.\n3. The US population keeps growing, but the amount of land remains the same. There are simply more people competing for the same sq ft of land.\n\nThe first two factors will let up eventually. When the economy recovers and inflation picks up, the Fed will raise interest rates and unwind its balance sheet. That will cause mortgage rates to rise, and prices to fall. But the Fed knows not too do that too quickly and cause a \"crash.\" Likewise, higher home prices will incentivize builders to create more housing and for people to sell. But it takes time to build new housing so there wouldn't be a sudden \"crash,\" and people would be less likely to sell if there were a \"crash,\" causing supply to dry up. The third factor will continue to push prices up: The population is growing and [will continue to grow for decades to come](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/content\/dam\/Census\/library\/publications\/2020\/demo\/p25-1144.pdf) (even considering the death rate for \"the average baby boomer\"), and the amount of land isn't.\n\nHome prices will almost certainly *rise more slowly* in the future. They might even go down a bit. But a decrease would likely occur slowly rather than as a \"crash.\" A \"crash\" happens when the price declines dramatically and unexpectedly. That is unlikely because (a) homes have an inherent value, like I mentioned above, and (b) none of what I'm discussing is ground breaking. \n\nI'm not saying there can't be a \"crash\" in home prices. We saw that in 2008. But it's precisely *because* we have a good understanding of what happened in 2008 that we're unlikely to see it happen again.  In spite of COVID, the current [delinquency rate](https:\/\/www.corelogic.com\/insights-download\/loan-performance-insights-report.aspx) is dramatically lower than the mortgage delinquency rate [after the great recession](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/DRSFRMACBS). A big reason for that is that lenders have been much more strict since 2008. In 2006, subprime mortgages made up [about 20%](https:\/\/www.recenter.tamu.edu\/articles\/tierra-grande\/Lingering-Effects-of-Subprime-Lending#:~:text=Subprime%20mortgages%E2%80%94broadly%20defined%20as,to%2020%20percent%20in%202006) of the overall mortgage market, whereas today they make up less than 5%. In other words, home prices may be high today, but people with mortgages are more creditworthy and are better able to afford the mortgages.  So we're less likely to see a huge foreclosure spike, meaning we're less likely to see a dramatic increase in the number of homes for sale, meaning prices are unlikely to \"crash,\" per se.\n\n**To the hundred plus people downvoting the automod and complaining you don't see any responses:** The reason there aren't any approved responses to this thread is because literally none of the dozen plus comments in the queue cite to a single source of any kind.

{"question":"For example.\n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/OutOfTheLoop\/comments\/x9btdc\/whats_up_with_black_twitter_celebrating_queen\/innq96h\/\n\nhttps:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/interestingasfuck\/comments\/xaekvs\/during_the_british_rule_of_india_from_1769_to\/\n\nI also get [this](https:\/\/mronline.org\/2019\/01\/15\/britain-robbed-india-of-45-trillion-thence-1-8-billion-indians-died-from-deprivation\/) article accusing not only Britain of stealing almost $50 trillion but also killing 1.8 *billion* Indians.\n\nLastly, a [master's thesis](https:\/\/www.diva-portal.org\/smash\/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1590981&amp;dswid=-5913) from Linnaeus University in Sweden, states\n\n&gt; British economic exploitation of Indian society is visible in the dreadful death toll from famine. Emeritus professor Utsa Patnaik estimated under the British regime, about **1. 6 trillion people had died.**\n\nWould like to know how far these large numbers are true.","answer":"I was trying to track down the original article by Utsa Patnaik but I couldn't find it. Part of where that $50 trillion comes from is the \"compounding at 5%\" assumption. 5% is a very high interest rate over 250 years - £1 in 1772 compounded forward at 5% becomes nearly £200,000 in 2022. If you only adjusted for UK inflation, which averaged 1.9% over the last 250 years, £1 in 1772 only becomes about £100 in 2022. To try and make sense of the influence of that we can look at the average flow of transfers per year between 1765 and 1938 that you'd need to get to $45 trillion with compounding to the present day at 5%; [I calculate that as $9 million per year](https:\/\/www.wolframalpha.com\/input?i=%2845*10%5E12%29%2F%28%5Csum_%7Bx%3D80%7D%5E%7B253%7D+1.05%5Ex%29), which is still a large sum, but if you change the compounding rate to 2% you instead get a total of $69 billion - almost a thousand times less than the figure Patnaik suggests. So the compounding assumption makes a big difference to the total figure.\n\nStill, is a flow of $9 million a year accurate? It's certainly true that there was a good deal of direct wealth extraction by British people from India, with a minority of British people involved with the East India Company getting filthy rich at the expense of Indians, to say nothing of the direct human rights atrocities and murder (William Dalrymple and Anita Anand's ongoing *Empire* podcast has some vivid details about what the British did in India). But there's a specific figure claimed here. Patnaik seems to equate \"drain\" with India's export surplus. Usually, exports are not a drain on a country because the countries that import the goods have to pay for them with something. The argument Patnaik makes is that the colonial setup allowed the British effectively to get exports from India without paying anything for them, so that the total value of the exports was all drained from India. Whether that's true is both an economic and a historical claim, and I don't know enough about the history to evaluate it. But [this comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/gc3ifr\/utsa_patnaik_claims_that_the_british_siphoned_45\/fp9yyx0\/) on \/r\/AskHistorians argues against the claim that all exports from India constituted drain, which would imply Patnaik is also overstating the flow of resources from India.\n\nThe 1.6 trillion people died figure is surely a typo for billion, a trillion is simply not a possible figure and it's not claimed by the other sources. The 1.8 billion deaths figure [seems to come from assuming](https:\/\/countercurrents.org\/polya201111.htm) that if the British had not ruled India, the annual death rate for India over the entire period would be 11 per 1000, which is the death rate of the US in the early 1920s; this doesn't seem like a remotely plausible assumption to me, but I'm no more a demographer than I am a historian.\n\nFinally, drain isn't necessarily the only way that Britain impoverished India. Acemoglu and Robinson have a lot of work on the importance of institutions in determining how fast a country grows. When the British were in India they set up institutions that were predominately extractive, aimed at taking wealth from the country rather than improving the lives of the people living there.

When government taxes people \/ businesses there is a higher cost for whatever is taxed and therefore reduced quantity. If the government spends that tax revenue on something that promotes economic growth, then the economic growth benefits of that can even out (or in some cases even result in a net positive benefit). \n\nWhen instead individuals either impose additional costs (bribes) or cause government spending to go to non-beneficial costs (kickbacks) you get more of the negative effects and less of the positive.

{"question":"If you buy a house for $30,000 and rent for $1,500 it would take you almost 2 years just to break even. So how do people become so rich by renting by properties? And how do they rent multiple properties at once when they’re not even breaking even on the first one?","answer":"It's a combination of a lot of things:\n\n1. Cash flow: after all expenses (including maintenance, operations, and debt servicing) the extra money accumulated each month. \n\n2. Loan pay down: Each month, they own more and more of the property. \n\n3. Appreciation: assuming 30,000 is the 20% down payment, the property purchased was $150,000. Gradually, the hope is for this to appreciate over time. This also works with rents. They may break even now or minimally cash flow, but over time rents generally increase. \n\n4. Leverage: going off the above point, they only paid $30,000, but are able to gain appreciation on an asset worth 150,000\n\n5. Scale: using legal tax loopholes you can trade up your property over time for larger and larger properties that can yield more of the above revenue streams at a larger scale. Trading your 150,000 building for a 300,000 building, then a 600,000 building, etc. \n\n6. Depreciation: using tax laws, property owners are able to depreciate their investment and reduce their tax burden, sometimes even more than the income the property produces. \n\nI probably missed a few, but that is the few ways why some invest and how people make money in Real estate."}

{"question":"Hi, I'm a teenager looking to get into stocks to make some money and I'm unsure if I should invest in typical blue chips or go with penny stocks? I start with about $500 and trade with either ETrade or Scott trade. Any tips from anyone?","answer":"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\n\nUnfortunately for smart blokes like you or me, you cannot simply jump into stocks and make money.  That is called day trading, and for most people, you're going to have about the same outcome as betting blindfolded in a casino.  \n\nFirst, here's what you **don't** do:\n\n* Penny stocks.  This is the game of suckers, and is a great place to lose every single cent. Nobody has a method for making tons of money from penny stocks, and if they do, they sure as shit aren't sharing it with you in a newsletter.  Might as well play roulette.\n* If you invest with $500, commissions are going to eat you ALIVE.  You pay $4-7 per stock trade.  Trading with $50,000?  That's only about 0.2% that you need to make up.  Trading with $500?  You're going to be down 1-2% IMMEDIATELY after buying.  The market hasn't moved, and you're already at a loss!\n\nSo, here's what you **should** do:\n\n1. Leave this subreddit and head over to \/r\/personalfinance.  They sound the same, they're miles apart.  \n2. Read the links on the sidebar and in the wiki.  \n3. Given as you're a teenager, you probably don't need to worry about things like paying rent, right?  Or car payments?  Your parents are helping out?  If so, you can probably gloss over the emergency fund.\n4. If you do have some sort of payments you make, you will first want to put aside a couple months' expenses.  What if you get fired?  You don't want your car repossessed!  So have a backup fund like this.  Maybe you do already. \n\nNow, for investing!  You've got a couple options here.  \n\n1. Retirement - if you made this money at a job, you can report it as earnings and open up a Roth IRA.  The downside?  The money won't be available for, like, 45 years.  The upside?  It will have tremendous compounding power if you start early, and is tax-sheltered: no tax penalties when you take it out.  Vanguard is most likely the best choice for a company with which to start an IRA.  However, there's a $3k minimum, so you'll need to save a bit more.  EDIT: If you pick a target retirement date fund, the minimum is only $1k - thanks to \/u\/doomtop for catching this.\n2. Maybe you want this money back in under 45 years.  That's understandable.  In that case, open a brokerage account.  Again, Vanguard is great because you can trade all of their mutual funds for free - no commission!  See the bullet point above.  However, you'll still need a minimum of $1k to buy into their STAR funds.\n3. If you're interested in individual stocks, well, see the point above with penny stocks.  Individual stocks aren't quite like flushing your money down the drain, but they are much riskier than mutual funds, and in most cases you're wagering a limited upside against a massive potential downside.  If you're going to go this route, get it in your head right now that this money is gone.  Kaput.  Flushed.  Down the drain.\n\nI sound like a pretty pessimistic ass, don't I?  Well, I started an individual account for buying stocks back when I was a teenager.  I still have it now, half a decade later.  I put around $10k in.  It is worth $15k right now.  And unless you get incredibly lucky, you won't be generating 50% gains per year.  And if you are that lucky, you'd still be better off buying lotto tickets.\n\nNow, I've mentioned mutual funds and Vanguard a couple times.  Before you get into the market, educate yourself!  (And it's not a big leap for me to assume that you aren't, by the way - no stock pro ever trades penny stocks.)  Here are some recommendations:\n\n* Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin, especially if you want to change your emotional relationship with money.\n* The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley, especially if you have high expenses.\n* The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp; Broke by Suze Orman.\n* I Will Teach You to be Rich by Ramit Sethi.\n* The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing and\/or The Bogleheads' Guide to Retirement Planning, both by Larimore et al, which covers the investing philosophy espoused by most of r\/personalfinance.\n* A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel, especially if you aren't convinced that index-investing is right for you.\n* The Four Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein\n* Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey, especially if you are in more debt than you want to be.\n* The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason, for timeless advice.\n\nIf you only read one from that list, by the way, make it \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street.\"  Trust me, it's worth your while.\n\n**TL;DR - Don't go into stock investing chasing ridiculous gains.  Consider setting up a retirement account.  Put money into indexed mutual funds, not single stocks.  If you buy single stocks, consider that money written off.  And, for the love of god, NO PENNY STOCKS.**\n\n^my ^fingers ^hurt ^now\n\nEDIT: Changed \"interest\" to \"tax penalties\" under the IRA, thank you very much to \/u\/ajfirecracker for catching my mistake."}

{"question":"Ok, I buy crypto and spend A lot of time on crypto Twitter and I notice they always talk about hyperinflation is coming and it's the end of the world, and compare it to the weimer republic.\n\nI want to ask someone that actually knows economics works because I see hyperinflation thrown around since January and I haven't seen anything crazy yet, I've seen prices increase but it's not like I'm spending $100 for a sack of potatoes.\n\nSo is this hyperinflation a reality or do we not know?","answer":"Unbeknownst to many, there is in fact an actual definition of the word ['hyperinflation'](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/h\/hyperinflation.asp). Which is a 50% increase in the price level per month. While what the US is seeing remains under 7% for the year, while the multi year trend has been barely any inflation at all. Moreover, pretty much everyone in economics is seeing the current inflation as mainly supply disruptions. And not a lasting trend. [The bond markets](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-12-10\/citi-s-bailin-says-bond-market-shows-inflation-is-transitory), which is the private sector entity with the most skin in the game concerning long  term or spiking inflation, is not pricing in any significant inflation expectations. \n\nBasically, people in the crypto markets don't understand economic fundamentals. And what they say is not a good indication of what is expected."}

{"question":"So today I went on www.bittrex.com to create an account and deposited roughly 26 BTC and traded them for other coins. Of course before doing this I did the basic verification, phone verification and enhanced verification and the 2FA authentication. I tested everything out and everything seemed fine...  Then I logged out at 18:54:27 2 Hours later I come home and try to log in and it says that Bittrex is checking for my browser and that this might take up to 5 minutes. Few minutes later it goes through and asks me for my 2FA which I provide. Again it takes a long time and ends up failing. So I wait a bit and do the whole process again and when I finally log in I notice that everythings gone... All my coins were sold for btc and gone. So I check the history and this is what I see... NEW IP LOGIN UNKNOWN_IP_WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS NEW_IP WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS and then a few mins later I log in... so what happend?","answer":"these are API calls. Most likely you logged onto a spoofed phishing site, and it sent api calls to the real site to get valid account balance info\/etc so it would look normal to you. As soon as you logged off, it sold your shit and sent it to that great wallet in the sky. \n\nThe momentary delay during your initial login was them creating the API keys that would later be used to transfer their loot out of the system.\n\n    NEW IP LOGIN \n    \n    UNKNOWN_IP_WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS \n    \n    NEW_IP WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS\n\nso now, you need to figure out what link you clicked on to be directed to the fake site. Was it a link in an email? If you went to the \"real site\" (via a bookmark or by typing the address in the address bar) but were phished anyway then most likely your computer is owned and you have an entry in your hosts file that redirects bittrex.com to a fake IP address that hosts an identical site.\n\nStart a command prompt as administrator and issue the following command \n\n    \"notepad.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\"\n\non a normal system, it should look like this: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/VYsXQ\n\nIf it has an entry for bittrex, you are hacked. It will look like this http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bcRa6 this is what it would look like if they redirected bittrex to another IP address on your computer, since windows checks this file first before querying DNS (Domain Name System) for the IP Address of bittrex.com. \n\nIf it has some random IP address in there, this is the place that stole your money. You can trace the IP Address owner and submit a report to police\/interpol\/justice league\/the guy who owns the ip address. Most likely it will be some internet cafe in Shanghai or India and that's where the trail will go cold.\n\nif the hosts file looks normal, open regedit.exe and check the registry key at: \n\n    \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DataBasePath \n    \n^^^ this is where windows host file location is specified and this is where windows will look for the host file it uses to resolve names (www.bittrex.com) to addresses (104.17.156.108 &lt;- their actual ip) for your browser to actually connect to.\n\nit should look like this http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Ius1v if it isnt identical to the example I provided, you are hacked\n\nif it doesn't point to \"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\drivers\\etc\" then they have created a fake hosts file somewhere else on your system (the new path specified in the registry key), and this is truly some next level hacking shit, because your adversary is employing stealth to mask their activities. \n\nAnother easy way to tell is to compare the results of a ping command (which uses hosts + dns) to the results from nslookup (which uses only DNS). If there is a mismatch (ping is hitting a server not listed in the results of nslookup) then this is a huge red flag. Example: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FRZ1dOt.png \n\nhere is an example of what it would look like if bittrex.com is redirected to 123.123.123.123 in the hosts file: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZPAtc\nhosts file: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/uFJiA\n\n\n\nIf this is the case you will want to take the system down to bare metal, blow away the OS, flash the motherboard, flash any firmware you can with known good copies, etc *before you use it for anything else.*\n\nAlso if your computer is owned, \n\n**don't forget to change every single password in every website (from a known good computer) starting with your bank, and then credit cards, lastpass (if you use it), or any other sites where you feel that they might liberate your hard earned cash from you all the way down to facebook and twitter etc. Matter of fact, do that anyways, like now.**\n\nyou might ask for help in \/r\/netsec or \/r\/computerforensics (hint they will be more inclined to help if there is a small fee). even if your coin is  not recovered at least you will have some idea who to shake your fist at. \n\nwhen you logged in and there was a long delay, did you get a 2fa prompt? or did you submit your 2fa with the login that took a long time?\n\nHope this helps &amp; sorry this shit happened to you, if I just got janked out of a hundred grand I would already be blackout drunk, so if this is the case, just shut down all your computer stuff and deal with it tomorrow."}

Is supply and demand really in doubt? Or are these just fringe positions that aren't backed up by research?","answer":"Wikipedia is weirdly a bad source for information on economics. It skews much more heterodox than what the majority of economists believe.

The administrative prices argument is usually based on the idea that when you ask businesses how they set prices many will tell you they take their costs and add a profit margin on top of that. My response is that 1) businesses habitually say things that are incorrect about their own businesses (see any business arguing increased taxes or minimum wages will cause mass layoffs) and 2) as long as there's competition firms could throw darts at a board to set prices and the results would be the same as if they set prices to maximize profit (because only the most profitable firms survive)"}

This caused a rise in the price of oil products in 2021.\n\nIn 2021 Russia started to build up troops on the Ukraine border, it was obvious to everyone that they were going to invade. This along with the drop in oil and refining production caused the large rise in oil prices in 2021. \n\nIn 2022 Russia invades Ukraine and you can see the price of oil spike again. What is also happening though is the oil industry, like every other industry, is having a labor and supply chain problem. The labor that they laid off in 2020 and 2021 is not returning in 2022. In addition it takes equipment and material to restart idle wells and that equipment and material is in short supply because of supply chain problems.\n\nNow then in addition Russian exports have received sanctions making them unavailable to sell in the countries that are issuing the sanctions. In response Russia has cut off oil and gas delivery to a number of European countries. Also the Nord Stream II pipeline that was expect to enter service delivering natural gas to Europe has not been started. \n\nIs it partially Putin's fault, yes, is partially because we are still in a pandemic and supply chains are still messed up, yes. Is it easy and politically expedient to blame it all on Biden or Putin, yes. Do people want to blame someone for a complex problem that has no solution, yes."}
{"question":"I read a washington post op\/ed saying that Biden's new loan forgiveness plan is regressive and mostly helps higher earning individuals. Is that the case? If it really is a regressive policy, why does it seem that its mostly left leaning progressives that are celebrating it?","answer":"The argument is about people who *after* finishing college will be well enough off that financial assistance becomes questionable.\n\nFinishing college comes with a huge earnings premium. The average college graduate earns roughly *double* in their lifetime compared to the average highschool graduate.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/policy2020\/votervital\/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.clevelandfed.org\/newsroom-and-events\/publications\/economic-commentary\/economic-commentary-archives\/2012-economic-commentaries\/ec-201210-the-college-wage-premium.aspx\n\nSo, people who attend college are on average much better off than those who don't. And of course people who don't attend college don't have student loans and therefore don't benefit from student loan forgiveness. Because of that, it's seen as a handout to at least the rich*er* part of the population.\n\nOf course that doesn't mean you can't make an argument for student loan forgiveness for the part of the population who have student loan debt and don't earn substantially more than highschool grads.\n\nAlso, there are at least some caps. People with incomes above 125k don't benefit. But then, that's still over 3x as much as the median personal income. Handing $10000 to someone who earns 100k a year is still regressive. Not to mention that it's an argument about *future* earnings as well. Maybe you're still in College, earning like 10k a year at some shitty sidegig, but if you *will* earn 100k+ a few years down the line, handing you student loan forgiveness is still regressive.\n\n&gt;If it really is a regressive policy, why does it seem that its mostly left leaning progressives that are celebrating it?\n\nBecause it's mostly politics and arguments tend to be rather dumb.\n\nBlanket student loan forgiveness is regressive. That doesn't mean that nobody is struggling or that you can't make an argument for those who could actually benefit from some help. But ultimately these discussions tend to be either slapfights or circlejerks, people aren't discussing the nuances of for which people it does and doesn't make sense."}
{"question":"I am 25 years old and just started earning 18 lpa in hand. My location will be gurgaon and I think I will be able to live in 50,000 rs per month. That leaves me with 1 lakh rs to spare every month. I already have a sip of 28000 per month. I don’t want to do debt investment as I am already investing 2 LPA in epf (deducted from my ctc of 22.5 lpa). Should I stick to mutual funds or try direct stocks ?\n\n\nEdit: I am a Software Engineer from a Tier 2 college, many people are asking.","answer":"Step 1: Emergency Fund: Before doing anything else, start with 6-12 months of expenses (50k x 12) and stash it away in an absolutely liquid investment - liquid meaning one that is near instantly convertible into cash - something like an FD. One additional point - this has to be separated from your regular savings account, so that you are not tempted to spend it unless it is a true emergency. \n\nThe idea of the emergency fund is to give you freedom. Let’s say your job turns crappy and you want to leave. If you are dependent on the salary, you can’t just up and leave. But if you have 12 months stashed away, you know you can take the time to breathe and search for a job that you truly like. Next, think of the power it gives you in a salary negotiation. You walk in not needing the job that instant. You are not stressed about your expenses and relying on whatever the HR of the new company throws at you. Instead, you have the ultimate power to walk away from the negotiation if you have to. Finally, it benefits you in case, god forbid, you lose your job for whatever reason. \n\nThe emergency fund is the last you draw from and first you refill. Remember, if you ever draw your emergency fund down, your first priority is to fill it back up.\n\nStep 2: now that you have an emergency fund, you can start to think of investments. First up, tax saving ones - Section 80C. Google this to know more but my suggestion here is ELSS. Maximize the annual limit of 1.5 lakh in one or more ELSS schemes to claim this tax benefit. \n\nStep 3: Now, you are getting close to investing, but you aren’t there yet. Think of massive unexpected expenses that you cannot cover out of pocket and insure against them - health insurance, life insurance, term life insurance etc. Health insurance is a must, but the others depend on your needs, and the needs of your dependents if any. \n\nStep 4: we made it to investing land! Do you fancy losing half your money tomorrow and taking 7 years to get back to the original principal while losing value to inflation? If your answer is no, and it should be, then you should diversify. Again, you are young, so you can afford to take more risk, but it should still be diversified. The exact allocation is up to you, but consider equities (stocks), bonds (corporate, government), commodities, precious metals, real estate etc. Remember to save fees wherever possible, 1% fee compounded over decades will destroy returns - ex: choose direct mutual funds instead of regular. The investments in this step are long-term, long-term meaning until retirement or next milestone (marriage - please invite only 50 people and get married on the cheap - no one cares these days and if they do, that’s on them; house, whatever other expense but at least a decade time horizon).\n\nYou check on Step 4 investments annually and adjust (rebalance) to bring the allocation back to your target allocation + change the target allocation itself to go more conservative as you age.\n\nStep 5: Some fun money! This is the fun part. What’s the new thing? Solano? NFTs? DeFi? Options trading? Something else? \n\nThis category is to satisfy your craving to be in on the action. Remember that you have stashed away a majority of your money towards long-term goals in Step 4. So this is the small amount that’s left that you are willing to lose in its entirety but also willing to take the risk to see if it pans out. \n\nStep 5 isn’t just a gimmick. Psychologically, having a small amount of your portfolio to play with for high-risk active investing makes you far less likely to touch the rest of your portfolio than if you had none at all. If you have zero allocated to this category, you become tempted to gamble (yes, most of those, regardless of what anyone says, are risky gambles) with your large savings.\n\nThat’s it my friend. Most of this stuff is on autopilot, you get to have your fun on the weekends, focus on your life and career and not worry everyday because you have a plan and you are sticking to it. \n\nGood luck to the both of us! I am 2 years older than you are 😅"}
{"question":"I assume Santa uses magic to conjure up the materials needed to manufacture the various toys.

So the supply curve shifts right. Christmas however temporarily increases demand, so there are higher goods supplied at the same price point.\n\nSince Christmas has been going on for years predictably the market expects it and corrects itself in small increments, so there are no large changes to the market.\n\nAfter Christmas demand for toys goes down, and the labor supply from the elves will not be seen till the next year.

It is a hypothesis that financial players on wallstreet have been committing crimes for decades and in doing so they are robbing the general public. A certain individual on reddit noticed that this stock had more shares shorted than were ever issued. A following was started. In January of 2021, the thesis was all but \"proved\" when we saw the price squeeze from a few dollars to over 500$ in less than a couple of days. The thesis was all but proved!! Since that time, there is enough evidence to show that the amount of shares sold short are even greater than last January. The new thesis since that time is that crimes were committed by shutting off the buying of this stock but the financial powers that be, rather than taking their loss, decided to double down. Increasing their short position and opening themselves up to an infinite loss of money. \n\nYou friend is playing the odds. He is not looking at this as an investment based on earnings, PE ratios, etc...He is looking at it as once in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of an infinite gain of money. January 2021 cannot be denied. It happened and we all saw the industry shut retail out from unimaginable gains. THey didnt do this because they were sour. They did it because if they hadn't they would have incurred infinite losses. We already know this to be true. Major Wallstreet execs have admitted to this. We were there as it happened. \n\nIn the end, any individual NOT holding GME is making the mistake. There has never been a greater opportunity to be a part of an infinite money glitch than there is now. Everyone holding GME is aware that this may not play out exactly as they want. They are all prepared to lose. If your friend made as much money as I did back in Jan...then he is playing with house money so it's even better. \n\nOne thing is for sure...if you think we are all nuts. Fine!

Has there been any breakthroughs or major shifts of thought?","answer":"Probably the biggest advancements in economics over that time period would be developments in computation which have allowed for development of more advanced data methods. Economic data is very plentiful in the 21st century and new methods emerging to leverage that data have also followed suit and resulted in their own developments. The growth of the industrial optimization field is a good example of how both data and method have evolved with computational ability to expand knowledge of industrial methods.\n\nAnother major growth area has been behavioral economics. A lot of new research in this field has emerged since the 1990s and especially in the 21st century, and although doesn't originate in the past 50 years (some behavioral economics can be found as earlier as Adam Smith), much of the current literature is based on findings that have only emerged in the last 30 or so years.\n\nFinally, changes to the structure of the global economy, especially the end of the Bretton-Woods system in the early 1970s, has resulted in all sorts of advancements and modernization in finance and currency. Financial markets look nothing like they did 50 years ago, and floating exchange rates have also resulted in a bunch of emergent areas of study as well (exchange rate pass through, currency markets and arbitrage, etc.).

{"question":"The shares plummeted as low as 271p within the first 20 minutes of trading, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe company had on Tuesday set its opening share price at the bottom of its target range at 390p, citing choppy market conditions and following a backlash from some large British investors over corporate governance. The initial public offering had given Deliveroo an opening valuation of around £7.6bn, the highest in London since resources group Glencore’s 2011 IPO, according to Dealogic data.\n\nDeliveroo sold shares worth £1.5bn in the offering, raising gross proceeds of around £1bn for the company to invest in new growth initiatives such as its Editions network of delivery kitchens, while existing investors will cash in to the tune of £500m.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/5028437e-accf-4624-8ecd-2b502d04743d","answer":"* 2020 peak demand due to COVID, will struggle to repeat that growth\n* Still loss making in 2020 despite the best possible operating conditions\n* Existing shareholders cashing out including Amazon\n* Not a no. 1 in any market (the 2nd\/3rd largest in most markets)\n* More concentrated than peers towards certain brands e.g. Nandos\n* Tough industry where everyone is fighting to maximise customer numbers which means rampant discounting (the amount of 50% off vouchers I get from Uber Eats is crazy)\n* Prospectus shows they reduced sales &amp; marketing employees by 75% in 2020 - odd for a 'growth' business\n* Prospectus didn't even mention competitors Just Eat Takeway and Uber\n* Ongoing legal risks e.g. Italy demanding EUR733m in fines from food delivery platforms\n* Aggressively pushing to retail investors with their app\n* IPO priced ~30% above Doordash on a comparable basis"}
{"question":"Tiny tiny apartment, 1bed $525pw in inner city Sydney. Lift had already made a few trips up, about 30 more people upstairs... I guess this was undervalued by about $75-100.","answer":"Haymarket is the heart of Chinatown, for Chinese people looking for places via Mandarin apps, they will see places in this area, the buildings are nice but there aren't that many.\n\nIf you look at the photo you will see almost everyone is Chinese here, these are the reasons there are so many people here.  One of the only inspections I have been to that had heaps of people was in the same building a year ago.\n\nThis amount of people absolutely does not reflect the rest of the rental market."}
{"question":"Honest question.\n\nWhere is all the money?  I hear nothing but bad news about financial crisis all over the world, and it seems that there is a shortage of cash - like it is some sort of natural resource.\n\nPeople haven't stopped buying stuff.  They still need food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Taxes are still collected. Fines are still levied. \n\nSo where is all the money?  I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \n\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?","answer":"Here's some way of thinking about it, and I'm not really sure if it's completely correct, but sometimes we oversimplify when trying to tell a five year old :)\n\nSay there are two people in the world. You and me. We both have $100. A total of $200 in the world.\n\nSuddenly, a wild bank appears. I deposit my $100 in the bank. I still have $100 and you still have $100. Now you want to buy something from me that costs $150. You go to the bank to loan money. The bank has $100 available so gives you $50. You give me $150. Now I have $250 and you are $50 in debt. I deposit the $150 in the bank.\n\nWe do this again and again, until I have $1000 on my bank account, and you are $900 in debt. I want to buy a house of $500 and go to my bank, demanding to take out $500. But there is only $200 in the whole world so the bank can only give me $200.\n\n\"Money\" has been created out of thin air, but it's actually you who are in debt. If you go bankrupt, the bank has a big debt it won't get back, and is in deep shit when I come around to demand my money back. At that point governments step in to loan the bank money for cheap, because if the bank fails, I will lose all my pension savings I put into that bank, as well as my companies and a lot of my employees.\n\nAnd other banks loaned this bank money, so if this bank fails, the other banks will be in the exact same position and will also fail, because then they will also have debts that won't be paid back.\n\nThere are regulations minimizing this - i.e. a bank is required to keep a percentage of the amount of money on its accounts, so there's a maximum limit of \"money created\".\n\n"}
{"question":"I honestly didn't know how to answer the question (despite my family from being from there). I had a couple go to answers such as corruption, exploitation, and bad leaders. But why is it that countries with a lot of resources and donations can perpetually be poor?","answer":"A professor of Economics at Oxford tried to answer this question, and wrote the book called [The bottom billion](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Bottom_Billion).  He highlighted a few points:\n\n* Conflict trap\n* Natural resource trap\n* Bad Neighbours\n* Landlocked Countries\n* Bad Governance (you might put corruption in here)\n\nCollier uses a lot of data to support his arguments, but of course, using correlative data to assign causal meaning is always going to run into trouble.  The book has it's critics, but also it's supporters."}
{"question":"I hang with you guys, not the YOLO's at r\/WSB, but I'm reading tonight and they're all convinced that the crazy run on GME is just starting (they're also high on BB).\n\nMaybe I'm just feeling a little FOMO, but I have some FU money and thinking about throwing some money at GME and BB next week just for the rush. Anyone else thinking about it?","answer":"What is going on: there are more shares of GME shorted than actually exist. That means that if the stock goes up for *any* reason, short sellers come under pressure to buy shares to close their short positions. But when the first short seller cracks and buys shares (taking a loss) they inadvertently drive the price up further, adding to the pressure on the other short sellers. Soon it’s a race to buy shares, but there simply aren’t enough to go around, so the price skyrockets before falling back down as shareholders finally take profits and sell. This is called a “short squeeze”. The only way a short squeeze is averted is if the stock price drops for some reason (like bad news from the company). GME is at ATH right now so it’s very unlikely that the short sellers will get out alive. It’s a matter of *when* they start to crack, not *if*. By all accounts they haven’t cracked yet, so the short squeeze hasn’t actually started.\n\nWhat happened Friday was a “gamma squeeze”, which is unrelated to a short squeeze, but happens when call options are being bought extremely fast and the stock price is rising, which indirectly causes market makers to buy massive volumes of shares to hedge, driving the price higher, and so on.\n\nThe high probability of a massive short squeeze caused retail traders to plow money into shares and calls on Friday, which in then caused a gamma squeeze, causing the stock price to go higher, making the short squeeze even *more* likely.\n\nIf you have gambling money and you want to take part in this unique event, you either buy shares or call options. Shares are safer (since no matter when the squeeze occurs, you’re ready, while calls expire) but calls give you leverage. Calls, even far OTM and short expiry calls, are likely to be very expensive. Everybody knows this is going down, it’s been covered on major news, and retail money is flooding in as people try to get onboard before the shorts crack.\n\nEdit: either pony up for gold so I don’t have to look at ads or save your money for GME shares Monday morning"}

{"question":"You hear about the kid who put in $500 into a memecoin and made 100k, but you don't hear about the hundreds who put $1000 and are left with $0.1\n\nYou also don't hear about the guys who put $10,000 but cant cash out because these memecoins have no liquidity.\n\nDon't beat yourself up for missing out.\n\nSurvivorship bias is a dangerous thing.","answer":"The need to “Win more” (greed) is a weird quirk of humanity. I didn’t buy into BTC until 28k. I passed on every opportunity when it was $1, $5, $100, etc... because I didn’t really understand what was happening. I was around when 4chan users were tipping each other in BTC. I sold my BTC at $50k. I could’ve bought in sooner and I could’ve held longer, but I DOUBLED MY INVESTMENT in a very short period of time. That’s the DREAM in most investments.\n\nThink about a traditional investment. If you make 20% in a year on a stock, that’s a really amazing stock. Take your profits and move on. Don’t agonize over how much you could’ve made with a different decision.\n\nI think it’s because with cryptos, people are investing very small amounts. $50-$100 at a time and expecting $1000 or more in profit. If you put in $100 and get $120 out, you’ve done VERY well compared to almost anything else."}

Employers are required to deduct taxes from any pay, even if it's a cash bonus.\n\nHe could have told the finance\/payroll person to \"make sure to deduct that $100 from u\/LouisSeaGays paycheck next week\". He meant deduct the taxes, they heard deduct the whole amount off your check.\n\nSo just call your boss. Say \"hey, I really appreciate the bonus you gave me. I'm a little confused though.

{"question":"Doesn't matter where you go, I'm not going to suggest any brokers. However, there are a number of brokers you can find who didn't stop or limit trading on stocks. Having people post gains on the RH app gives new users a reason to give money to those scum thinking its the preferred app. When they gain new members and you own a stock like GME at a good broker it still fucks you in the end when they limit their clients ability to buy.

The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \n\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?","answer":"To summarize, the money never existed. The best example I can give is the housing bubble. Houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money. When people couldn't make their payments, the house prices crashed.\n\nThe boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended (boom) and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes (bust).\n\nThe real question that people should be asking is not \"Where did all the money go?\", but \"Why is money issued by private banks?\"\n\nMoney is a social invention to facilitate trade. Should it not be like a public water utility? Counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it. Money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized. All natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters, joules, degrees, etc. Money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest. We essentially pay rent on all money that isssued and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created, once again at interest. This is why economists generally say some inflation is good. Finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality, money is just an IOU that requires no such interest payment for it's issue.\n\nInterest should be made if a loan is issued against savings, but not for the simple issuance of money. There should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment. You can read more about this from reading about Arthur Kitson. In this way, the public controls the value of it's money, not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class.\n\nIf you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt, read the work of Frederick Soddy. It's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least. Wealth is subject to the laws of thermodynamics while debt is an invention of the human will. Debt never rots or degrades with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest - nothing in the natural world does this."}

{"question":"So, unfortunate circumstances have made me a millionaire over night at the age of 37.\n\nI remember stating that if I wasn’t a millionaire by age 40, i would blow my brains out.\n\nBe it as it may, my grandfather passed away from old age, and unbeknownst to me, he left me his mansion in the sweetest part of town, and a his childhood home which is about 2 hrs away; also in a prime location.\n\nMy aunts and uncles screwed me and my mom out of everything when my grandmother  passed away, since she left no will. All certificates were then modified to favor them.\n\nBut now, as hard of a situation this is, the tables turned.\n\nI will not be selling my homes or any art of jewelry. I am not allowed to anyways, for 5 years.\n\nI have received 450k cash along with this.\n\nWhat’s the best way to work these 450 so I don’t have to sell my homes for millions of dollars.\n\nThanks","answer":"Typically what people do here is start with a capital allocation plan where they split up their money putting more of it into lower risk investments and smaller sums into higher risk ones.  How much to put in each \"basket\" of risk depends on the individual but usually it'd be something like 300k into a low risk stable longer term return. 100K into a slightly more aggressive mid term sort of investment and then 50K (maybe split over 5\\* 10K) high risk sort of investments that can either lose or hit you home runs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea here is you exposure yourself to a lot of potential upside if things run well for you but limit the amount of downside since most of your money is in lower risk investments.  If you do not have a lot of experience with investing you're going to want to spend a decent amount of time and effort into researching your lower risk\/higher capital investments."}
{"question":"If my underlying assumption is incorrect, please elucidate me. \n\nThat said, I know of several family members who worked as grocers and retail workers and they were able to buy their homes in the 70s and eventually paid them off. \n\nI, on the other hand, have a well-paying job, a graduate degree, and I’m also married to a partner with a great job. \n\nYet, had it not been for inheriting the equity from my grocer and retail worker relatives, I would never have been able to affordably buy my townhouse. \n\nIn contrast, similarly sized 2 or 3 bedroom apartments for rent in my area are now priced at about $3,500 a month.

{"question":" Warren Buffett, once, advised a bunch of youngsters, to get a punch card with only 20 spots in it. That’s the number of stocks they’re allowed to buy in their lifetime, he told them.

They treat their investments like a Playstation game. They think that they need to always act. If they don’t act, they lose the game, they assume. The fact of the matter is investing **isn’t a game**. It isn’t easy. If it was, most people would win. In reality, though, the majority of investors actually lose. Some estimate that 90% of investors lose. The problem is, most investors believe they are among the 10% that win!","answer":"I have a poster of Warren Buffett above my bed.

{"question":"I can understand how other people touted as \"wealthiest person in the world\" got their wealth, for example:\n\n* Bill Gates gained his wealth because his Windows operating system is the dominant computer operating system\n* Jeff Bezos gained his wealth because his e-commerce business is widely used worldwide\n* Sergey Brin and Larry Page gained their wealth through creating the world's dominant search engine and web browser\n* Vladimir Putin gained his wealth through corruption at the head of a massive and resource-rich nation\n\nIn contrast:\n\n* SpaceX products and services are not as widely used as those of Microsoft, Amazon or Google\n* Tesla comprises less than 1% of the market share of automobiles worldwide\n* Elon Musk's other promises such as Hyperloop have been nothing but hot air","answer":"The vast majority of Elon Musk's net worth come from Tesla, so let's ignore the other things for now. \n\nTesla is currently the most valuable asset cat company in the world. In fact, it's worth more than the next 5 biggest combined. So it's easy to see how a major owner and leader of the by far most valuable car company in the world could have a high net worth. \n\nRemember those wealth number just list net worth. They are not just counting his cash in the bank. It's highly unlikely he could sell all his stock and realise that kind of money without the stock tanking.\n\nNow, from the way you've phrased your question or sounds like you doubt the value of Tesla. You may be right of course, and if you are his net worth will go down as others figure it out. However the reason a lot of people value it so highly goes something like this:\nA companies value is not determined by what its doing right now. If I had a dollar but knew it was about to turn into $100, I wouldn't sell it for a dollar. I wouldn't even sell it for $50, I'd probably value it at very close to $100. So people are looking at Tesla and trying to work out what it will turn into over the next decades. \nThey only sold a bit over 1% of new cars, but they certainly didn't sell them at the average price. These are expensive cars globally.\n\nNow we get to electric cars. A lot of people think there won't be many petrol cars sold in 10 to 20 years. Tesla sold double as many electric cars than its next competitor in 2021. So the bet is, is it easier for existing auto makers to switch their factories to electric cars? Or is it easier for Tesla to build new factories? If it is easier for existing car manufacturers to convert factories, how did Tesla get such a huge lead inf the first place?\n\nNow everything I've said about Tesla has little to do with economics and could be all wrong. But the stock is valued that high because there are people who believe it, and demonstrate that with their wallet by buying a piece of the company for what they think the company will be worth. Elon Musks net worth is calculated based on the amount investors show they believe the company is worth by buying shares, divide by the portion he owns.\n\nRemember Bill Gates didn't become a billionaire in the current era. He did it in the 80s. Only about 5 million PC's were sold that year. He was a billionaire long before his Microsoft was ubiquitous in every household. \n\nAnd so Elon Musk has a high net worth before his companies either have an impact commensurate with their valuations, or decline with his net worth to follow."}

This is almost a philosophical question.. same can be asked in the context of a tech startup. And the answer is, startups sometimes look where big companies dont, or they actually have an edge! (say a proprietary IP)","answer":"Yes. In fact, there are many advantages to being a (automated) retail investor\/trader. I won't distinguish automation as an advantage or disadvantage because it is simply a tool for executing strategies and not a strategy within itself. \n\nFirst and foremost, small trades (I mean &lt;$100k or so, assuming a liquid enough asset) do not really move markets, allowing your positions to effectively realize the full intended movement at the time of entering the trade. Second, and perhaps more importantly, retail order flow is considered \"non-toxic\" and often allows you to get better fills. That's right - market makers DO NOT want to trade against sophisticated institutions and will actively try to avoid their orders. However, retail order flow is literally just considered noise (as for the most part, it is), so market makers love to trade on it (think Robinhood). No matter how sophisticated your strategies might be, your trades will be considered retail and gobbled up by market makers, providing you with better fills. \n\nThe markets are so complex and there are so many opportunities for everyone involved. To think that \"I can't do this because someone bigger and smarter already does\" is defeatist and incorrect. Good strategies make money; bad ones don't - simple as that."}

{"question":"I hear lots of people calling for a boycott on companies like Nestle or Apple, because those companies are often tied to child labor and inhumane working conditions in foreign countries. And obviously child labor and sweatshops are despicable, but I’ve always wondered: if these boycotts became widespread enough to start affecting the company, would they actually start treating their employees better? Or would they just like, fire them all? Do boycotts help improve the conditions of mistreated workers, or do they just lead to them being unemployed and even poorer?\n\n(This is probably the dumbest and most ignorant question ever, but I don’t take AP Macro til next year and I kinda don’t know a lot about the global supply chain)","answer":"Far from being dumb or ignorant, it is indeed a very intelligent and legitimate question . Here is an excerpt from a paper that investigates this issue: \n\n\"A common perception is that most child laborers work for wages in the formal sector, conjuring images of children working long hours in sweatshops or toiling away in mines. As a result, consumer boycotts and trade sanctions against products using child labor as an input are often discussed as means of reducing the incidence of child labor. In reality, however, such methods may have little impact for several reasons. Firstly, nearly 70 percent of working children are active in the agricultural sector, rather than manufacturing (ILO, 2006). Secondly, very few children work for wages outside the home; rather, most children are employed by their parents on the family farm or enterprise (Edmonds and Pavcnik, 2005). As a result, the majority of child laborers will not be affected by boycotts and trading sanctions. Further, children working in the affected sectors may simply relocate to an unaffected sector. Similarly, an outright ban on child labor would in most cases be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce and as such would likely to have little effect on the overall incidence of child labor. In the worst case, a ban could end up making some children significantly worse off if these children are compelled to work in order to keep themselves and their families out of extreme poverty. This is not to say that bans are never motivated; clearly a ban on illegal and hazardous activities is desirable. However, additional policy instruments are necessary in order to effectively combat child labor.\"\n\n[https:\/\/gupea.ub.gu.se\/bitstream\/2077\/18369\/1\/gupea\\_2077\\_18369\\_1.pdf](https:\/\/gupea.ub.gu.se\/bitstream\/2077\/18369\/1\/gupea_2077_18369_1.pdf)"}

{"question":"This is driving me crazy just from confusion. In like 90% of books and sources I read, experts say rent control creates scarcity, it does the opposite of its desired effect essentially. I’ve seen that when rent control was put into place in various cities it immediately lead to less housing development. I’ve seen that it causes landlords to not care about upkeep, it causes abandoned buildings occasionally cause they weren’t profitable, and I read it can lead to construction of more luxury buildings where rent control doesn’t apply. In that last case it seems like this system that tries to help the poor in fact helps the rich. Yet I still see politicians advocating for it and it still exists in places around the world. What the hell am I missing? People don’t seem that upset over this and I don’t get it lol.","answer":"See my username.\n\nIt is bad for society, bad for new\/future residents, bad for a city as a whole.  That's basically the economic story, but I don't think you are asking why it is bad.\n\nSo why do we have it?\n\nBecause it is great for for current renters and current renters vote.  They outnumber landlords (many landlords probably don't even live in the same local political zone as their properties) and are easily moved by self-interest.  Nobody likes paying rent, so it is really easy to vote for a candidate who is going to keep yours down.\n\nWhy does it continue in places where it is having a clear adverse effect?\n\nSame reason basically.  The local tenants control who gets elected.  Any long time resident is heavily benefiting from rent control so they want to to stick around.  The people who are harmed most, such as those who can't find an apartment, don't live there and don't vote in the district.  \n\nSecond answer is just that a lot of people don't understand.  They see super high rents in non-rent controlled units and see it as evidence that rent control works.  Instead of blaming the rent controlled units for the problem, they get jealous and wish they had one themselves... They aren't going to vote against the thing they aspire to eventually have!\n\nBut mainly I think the story is that in most places with rent control, renters control the politicians who wrote the laws rebuilding rent.  They vote their own self interest and the politicians follow.\n\nedit: last night after posting this I listened to the rebroadcast [Freakonomics podcast about rent control](https:\/\/freakonomics.com\/podcast\/rent-control-rebroadcast\/).

However, hiring would probably be more arduous and structural unemployment would likely go up significantly because of the associated bureaucracy (voting on each new employee) and cost (every current employee’s equity and share of profits being diluted) of hiring.   \n\nTo clear something up, worker ownership is socialism at a systematic level.

In that time I've traded just about every type of market condition there is.  Made a ton of money during the internet boom because all you had to do was trade a .com name and made a fortune.  I was on top of the world, king of the castle, the head honcho... then came the internet crash and I lost every damn penny chasing the dragon, and then some.  \n\nUnfortunately, I'm seeing a very similar mindset now as I did during the internet boom.  Everyone thinks they can make money and everyone is an expert.

Don't get me wrong, I was profitable for most of those first 7 years (minus the internet bust blowup) but my personal volatility was off the charts.\n\nMy advice is to keep it simple.  Don't get caught up in trading all sorts of different vehicles, pick one, and learn it like the back of your hand.  Become the master of that one thing.  Then just grind it out.  All I trade is the \/YM now.  That's it, nothing else.  (I also manage my own investments but that's not trading).\n\nNext, don't trade just to trade, only trade when the setup is proper.  Patience is definitely the key here.  Don't rush into trades, don't trade just because you haven't done so in a while, don't force anything.  There have been weeks where I don't place a single trade.  \n\nFinally, learn when to sell losers.  It's more important (by a little) than knowing when to sell for a gain.

He told me he wanted to start trading and I told him to study it some more, or at the very least, start by paper trading.\n\na few days ago I found out he threw thousands of dollars on a stock that he did 0 research on, without telling me. His reasoning on picking that stock was that \"The graph went down so it must come up\". I had a look at the stock, the share price lost half of it's value since January, and then jumped 40% since May. He bought in at the 2-month high basically.\n\nHe currently has NO exit plan and I'm scared to tell him to cut his losses because there's a possibility of the share price jumping, and he'll end up blaming me for pushing him into selling. I'm infuriated and I don't know what to do. He clearly has no idea what he's doing and won't bother listening to me. I could let him lose the money as a learning curve but then I'd just feel shit about myself.","answer":"Some people learn by the trial of fire.

{"question":"They say if you ask a poor person for money advice is poor and with rich it's rich. So I have been asking advice of people who have become financially independent, at least money isn't a stressing factor in their lives.\n\nOh my god. \"Save 20% of income and invest it.\" I explain money is tight and hardly any left to buy a single stock. \"Oh then ask for a raise or job hop.\" OK, my review is 6 months away, and in the Mean time what else? \"A side Hustle! Whatever you make there invest it!\" Tried and got burned out, actually made me work less from exhaustion. \n\nSo I asked \"what did YOU do?\" And the story is what you expext; my parents paid for college, I got into tech, my dad knew someone in the company, etc.\n\nThey are giving me advice they didn't follow through with. They could have just said \"I don't have any experience with that, I grew up in privilege.\"","answer":"At this point becoming financially independent requires a high salary, very low expenses, very good savings habits or a combination of two of the three. You’re asking people what they did to get there and saving AT LEAST 20% of their income, having side hustles, job hopping are all common things that actually work. When you are truly in poverty and are working lower wage jobs then  these things are just not possible so it’s hard to relate to that advice."}
{"question":"By Econ 101, I do not mean people who are ignorant of the study of economics.

I never considered that the velocity of money could fall!","answer":"It’s seems no one believes in supply and demand anymore.

{"question":"What is going on with their housing and land valuation setup that home ownership functions in the opposite manner to other national peers, where real estate prices consistently increase despite decreasing property conditions?","answer":"Earthquakes, population decline, and arguably some policy related to zoning.\n\nFirst off, we should note its the house, and not usually the land that depreciates. This is in large part because of earthquakes. People do not want to buy old houses because they dont meet the most recent earthquake standards.

I think it has a limited impact, but given that this is a recent phenomenon and the zoning measures mostly aren't, I highly doubt this is the whole story*. In the 80s Japanese housing had insane price runs despite the zoning laws being quite similar.

{"question":"What are some major questions that the most respected economists are working on today? Is there any issue that has two \"evenly matched\" sides and no true consensus yet?","answer":"Economics is a huge field with a *lot* of topics being researched. Just a select few off the top of my head:\n\n- In the macro world, why are interest rates so low (not just today, but even pre-COVID)? There are a [number of competing theories](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/s4zs7s\/why_are_longterm_interest_rates_so_low_is_larry\/hsus29m\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3), with the main ones being global savings glut, secular stagnation, and a shift towards less risky assets (this is explored in more detail in the link).\n- In labor economics, the effects of minimum wage on employment is still frequently researched. The [FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_minwage\/) covers the topic well. Research has revealed that minimum wages don’t always lead to large employment losses, so most research today is focused on the question of at what level (or under what conditions) minimum wages could become more problematic.\n- In developmental economics, there is lots of cool research going on trying to answer the question of “how do we make very poor people better off?” I highly suggest “Poor Economics” by Banerjee &amp; Duflo (2019 Nobel laureates) as a non-technical read on the subject. It remains my favourite non-technical econ book.\n- Climate economics is a very active field.

{"question":"According to Wikipedia, the United States has the seventh highest nominal GDP per capita in the world and the eighth highest PPP GDP per capita. And most of the countries ranked higher than it are very small and generate their money through oil (Norway, Qatar) or banking (Switzerland). Also according to Wikipedia, the US has the highest median household income. \n\nSo what explains this? Why is America so rich, even compared to other developed countries?","answer":"This question is too broad to provide a definitive answer to. \"Why are some countries richer than others?\" is *the* fundamental question in the field of macroeconomic growth and development. Getting a comprehensive answer would require taking a semester long course on growth and development (at the very least).\n\nWe know a little bit more about what are typically called \"proximate\" causes (for a general framework, see [here](http:\/\/klenow.com\/DevelopmentAccounting.pdf)). This answers the question of how the US makes more stuff than (say) France, in a literal physical sense. The short answer here is that generally speaking about 10-30 percent of the difference is explained by education and skill differences (\"human capital\"), 20 percent is explain by more and better machines (\"physical capital\"), and 50-70 percent is explained by \"total factor productivity\" (TFP), which is basically a term meaning \"everything else that is harder to measure\/quantify\".\n\nGiven its large role in explaining income differences, the last few decades of growth research has mostly involved trying to break down TFP and determine\/quantify its various components. I will defer to the previously linked paper if you want further discussion of this.\n\nBut this leaves open the question: why was it the US, in particular, that ended up with high human capital, physical capital, and TFP? Why not Argentina or some other country? These are effectively the first sets of arrows in the framework I linked.\n\nThis is a much broader and more open question without a conclusive answer. The answer seems be to lots of little things from history (WWII, colonialism, etc) to geography to culture to simple randomness. I'm unaware of the solid lit review covering all of this, and it's beyond the scope of this post. The gist is: there's a lot here that we don't really know and this bit in particular is still an active area of research.\n\nAnyways, that's my quick summary. There is also a cheap answer to your question that I have saved for the end (because apparently I wanted to write a post about development accounting). This is that the US simply works more hours than many of these countries which lets them make more income. If you look at [output per hour worked](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/labor-productivity-per-hour-pennworldtable?tab=table), the US is still near the top but it isn't a crazy outlier."}

Hence, while going to the bar at the same time might be smart, you need to do more to ensure that deciding to go to the bar again is [individually rational](https:\/\/www.econlib.org\/book-chapters\/chapter-ch-4-individual-rationality-in-social-choice\/) for her. \n\nSo, you make a deal with the bar owner\/bartender to make a drink cheaper, or something that that reduces her cost of attendance. \"But it'll be very expensive if I have to strike a deal!\" Then you write out your intertemporal utility maximization problem, where your goal is to (potentially) marry this lady, but in the short run you'd have to pay the cost of the deal with the bartender (Note that the goal is probably to just meet this lady and get to know her more, with the possibility than you go on to want to marry her, but that depends on signals and whatnot; since it's an exam I think this can be mentioned in a line, while you just simplify the goal to marriage, due to limited time). I'd recommend writing search theory [Bellman equation(s)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dynamic_programming) for this portion, and characterizing the reservation cost of a deal you strike with the bartender using standard assumptions on utility\/production functions, i.e. the cost that makes you indifferent between a deal and no deal. See how you can apply the [Slutsky equation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slutsky_equation) to her decision-making process.\n\nThese parts can be answered in maybe 2\/3 a page of writing\/equations with normal-sized handwriting, which I think is reasonable for an exam question.\n\nIf you have time remaining, I'd definitely go into complements and substitutes. The day of the week matters here. My prior is that going to the bar on a Friday night is complementary to going to the bar next Friday night, but is a substitute for going to the bar on Saturday night. Going to the bar on, say, a Monday night is probably not a complement with anything, as the impression I have is that people unfortunately tend to do that when going through a rough time. But I don't drink, so I wouldn't know.\n\n*Note: this question is open-ended and most likely will accept multiple answers. It probably wants to test your economic reasoning.*\n\nEdit: I mixed up individual rationality with incentive compatibility at first."}

{"question":"What do economists think of models of socialism where the means of production are owned by the workers, not the state, operating through a mixed market? Is such a thing even feasible?","answer":"The problem with this approach is that it creates a mismatch between supply of and and demand for capital. Different industries have wildly different capital to labor ratios, so you end up with situations where, e.g., landscapers own very little capital while factory workers own huge amounts of capital, despite these jobs having similar skill requirements.\n\nHow does that happen? It's not hard to buy landscaping tools, but how does a worker fresh out of high school get the cash to buy a share of a factory so he can work there?\n\nMaybe the factory worker doesn't have to buy in, but gets shares of the factory in addition to a salary. So he must get paid a lot less than the landscaper. But that's okay, since he has savings in the form of factory shares which I guess he'll sell to new workers when he retires. Unless the factory goes bust. Then he's kind of screwed. Investing your life's savings in one business isn't a great idea. Also, if the factory goes through a rough spell and loses money for several years, how do workers get paid?\n\nMeanwhile, the landscaper is living large on pure cash compensation. He's making so much money that he decides to save some and invest it in...what, exactly? There's no stock market because the means of production are all owned by the workers. Some market socialists allow the issuing of bonds, although it's never really been clear to me why buying a portion of future EBITDA via lending is kosher while doing so via equity is not. So there's an option, maybe.\n\nElsewhere, a group of young geniuses have a great idea and want to start a business. Let's say that after five years it has a 90% chance of failure and a 10% chance of making $10 billion. They need $5 million dollars to pay their business and living expenses for the next 5 years. They do not have this money. Lending is not a good way to fund this because of the high risk of failure. Equity investment would be ideal for this situation, but that's not allowed, because workers have to own the means of production. So they just go to work at existing companies.\n\nTo summarize, a non-exhaustive list of the problems:\n\n1. People who have cash to invest and people who need capital to do their jobs are often not the same people. This is an especially big problem for forming new firms, since bootstrapping is infeasible in industries that require large up-front investments.\n\n2. Workers who save money benefit from the ability to diversify their investments. Investing exclusively in the company where you work is a really bad idea.\n\n3. Often less-skilled workers simply are not productive enough that they can afford to take a large share of their total compensation in the form of shares.\n\nWe have capital markets in order to allocate capital efficiently and mitigate risk. When you don't allow the roles of worker and investor to be played by different people, that doesn't happen.\n\nFurthermore, workers who want to own the means of production can do that right now. All we have to do is set aside some of our pay to invest in the stock market. Preferably in an index fund instead of just one company."}

{"question":"Since billionares have so much money that is not being used to move the economy sunce its not being used at all, isn't this bad for the economy in a capitalist country?","answer":"Your question assumes that billionaires’ wealth is mostly made up of cash. But it’s the opposite actually, they typically owns assets that are worth billions in the open market today.\n\nIn essence what that means is they bought\/invested in those assets with some cash at some point. And the recipients of that cash (typically some company), deployed that cash in a value creating manner for the public i.e. they provided goods and services that generate profits. The goods and services generate profits because the customers value them and are willing to spend money on it. In addition they generate profits because the company created the goods and services efficiently, in other words it costs them less to create than what customers are willing to pay. \n\nSo billionaires cash is actually being put to work in the market, and this is actually the essence of capitalism. Letting people choose where they want to spend their money, and in return giving them ownership of what they buy. In fact, this works the same whether you’re a billionaire or not. For most people with any retirement account, they don’t actually have much cash. They’ve given their cash to someone else (usually another investor) who uses that cash however they want. This is all overly simplified but it’s meant to address your assumption and explain how the money is being used."}

Why would a superpower and rich country like USA need to borrow anything from a much poorer country like India? How does this work? Why is USA borrowing that money and what for?","answer":"Nations borrow by issuing bonds. They sells bonds at auctions. The bond then pays a payment over some number of years, that's called the coupon. At the end the principle is paid back.\n\nSo, you could buy a bond with a face value of $100. It might pay, say, $2 every year. Then after 10 years, for example, the government will pay the entire $100 back. This bond is auction off to the highest bidder and then can be traded on the bond market.\n\nAs a result, all sorts of people and organizations own bonds. Nearly anyone who wants to can buy bonds. Though some countries have laws limiting buying bonds from other countries they consider hostile.\n\nMany governments buy the bonds of other governments. That is all about controlling forex rates. Government like to have the ability to prevent steep declines in forex rates. To prevent that they intervene in the forex market and buy their own currency paying with another currency. Very often that other currency is the US dollar. Rather than holding dollars countries often hold bonds which can easily be sold in exchange for dollars.\n\nImagine that there's an emergency of some sort in India and the value of the rupee falls. The government needs to import some goods to deal with the emergency. They hold US bonds which they can sell for dollars then they can buy the goods for import with those dollars."}

{"question":"I read a lot of posts asking about surviving or at least building a financially smart life on a 'meagre' 60k wage. I earn about 30k as a social worker and do alright. I mean I have to manage spending of course, but I'm not in trouble or anything, and seem to be able to use advice here as well. But I'm just wondering: is this mainly a sub for the more wealthy?","answer":"36k earner here from Austria! That translates to 1.8k netto monthly. It has been my salary for about 2 years now. Previously my salary was 26k\/1.4k netto (PhD student) for about 3 years after which I was unemployed for 1½ years. My salary during that time was about 20k\/1.1k netto. All of these numbers are [below the median Austrian household income](http:\/\/www.statistik.at\/web_en\/statistics\/PeopleSociety\/social_statistics\/household_income\/index.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202020%20EU,per%20annum%20at%20their%20disposal.). \n\nMost people tend to invest with whatever \"left over\" income they have at the end of the month. For me, it has always been the opposite - I'd always take out a fixed sum (even when I was unemployed) and lock it away. Then I'd figure out how to make do with what was left over. Despite the fact that I am making more than I used to, this habit has stuck. In my head, my salary is still just 1.4k. If I could make do on that salary for 3 years, I can jolly well do it now. As soon as the paycheck comes in, I lock 300 to 500 away and then figure out how to deal with the rest. \n\nThis sub has definitely been helpful for me and a few friends of mine. We are all in the 20k to 40k range. Based on what we've learned here, we've all started off a Sparplan and are putting away anywhere between €50 and €300 a month on the regular. It ain't much, but it's honest investing!\n\nWe all have anywhere between 1k and 4k as emergency funds and whenever we have spare cash, we stash it away and have anywhere between €100 and 5k saved over the span of a few months to a few years that we use for buying big dips whenever they happen. It's likely a good idea to invest this sum instead of trying to time the market, but we prefer doing it this way because transaction fees are ridiculous unless you go via a Sparplan."}
{"question":"I read this NPR article about how The Fed printing money is not likely to cause hyperinflation as the money is unlikely to flood the market and drive up prices of commodities. \n\nIn the case of say Zimbabwe or Venezuela, why does hyperinflation happen? Is it a matter of scale of printing?","answer":"In the case of what the fed does right now, they are providing relief for a lack of liquidity through collateralised short term loans. Once those loans are paid back, the money is destroyed again. It's also not really money that enters the \"general economy\" but just to fulfill outstanding debt obligations between companies and banks.\n\nWhat countries like Venezuela did is different. They fund their governments through money creation, so the government can buy goods and services. That is money that does enter the economy, leading to inflation."}

{"question":"From what I've read house prices being high and rapidly increasing is a good sign they may crash. I've read this in property investment guides and online about timing the cycle. Everywhere I look seems to assume that property prices will continue to rise well into the 2040s!\n\nNow I've read the average baby boomer will die in 2034, which will create a buyers market but no analysts from property firms or banks seem to agree. My sneaking suspicion is that they are wealthy and benefit from increasing house prices and wouldn't want anyone to know the party has to end eventually.","answer":"The first point is that it's spectacularly hard to time bubbles. I haven't heard anyone say that prices will rise monotonically, and I would be skeptical of anyone who says they can predict year over year changes for the next twenty years. I certainly can't. There are also semantic questions of what exactly a \"crash\" is (are dropping prices a crash? is it determined by foreclosures?).\n\nStill, limiting ourselves to the near term (maybe the next five years), we can look at various reasons for why home prices are going up and ask ourselves if we think that these reasons could be signs of an impending crash. \n\nOn the demand side, one of the largest reasons for why some many people want homes now is that interest rates are at historic lows. It is considerably [cheaper to get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage than it ever has been](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/MORTGAGE30US). This will push up the price of homes because it means that more people are able to afford them. Importantly, [foreclosures are also at record lows](https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/mortgages\/foreclosures-fell-to-record-low-in-2020\/) (with the very important caveat that while they are especially low currently because the [Federal Government has issued a freeze on foreclosures for homes with federally backed mortgages](https:\/\/www.hud.gov\/press\/press_releases_media_advisories\/HUD_No_21_009)). There will likely be an uptick on foreclosures when the moratorium lifts, as the COVID-19 pandemic has meant that [more homeowners are behind on their mortgage payments](https:\/\/www.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publication\/103273\/housing-finance-at-a-glance-a-monthly-chartbook-november-2020_0.pdf) (pg 24). However, compared to the Great Recession, which saw historic levels of foreclosures on the backs of predatory loans, the low interest rates do not seem to be inviting people to take out loans they truly cannot afford. \n\nOn the supply side, the number of homes we are building has not kept pace with the increased demand for homes. The stock of available housing, which peaked in 2011 [has hit a historic low](https:\/\/www.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publication\/103273\/housing-finance-at-a-glance-a-monthly-chartbook-november-2020_0.pdf) (pg 20). This has been [exacerbated by the pandemic](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/us-underbuilding-housing-over-the-past-decade-2020-9), which caused many construction firms to cease production during the otherwise peak summer months.  [Housing construction has been trending up in the last decade](https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/united-states\/housing-starts); it just hasn't kept pace with demand. \n\nIt's possible that these trends will reverse. Interest rates could go up and the relative housing supply could increase. Both of these would push down prices. Still, something like the Great Recession where a substantial number of homeowners are unable to make their payments seems unlikely. The rise in foreclosures was driven by predatory loans where repayment relied on the promise of refinancing based on increased equity. I don't see evidence that this is happening. Maybe housing prices will fall (or at least stop increasing faster than inflation) in the next 10 years -- I don't know -- but I would not predict the housing market to collapse in the next few years."}

{"question":"There's this [article](https:\/\/monthlyreview.org\/2009\/05\/01\/why-socialism\/) by Einstein blatantly endorsing socialism.  \nI'd like to clarify that I have no dog in this fight, and I think Einstein being Einstein deserves the benefit of the doubt.  \nNow I read the article. It has some interesting points. Though it seems very idealistic in some cases.  \nMost discussions I've encountered about this article online and on reddit talk about whether Einstein's qualified to talk about this along with the typical socialism\/capitalism circlejerks.  \nNone are actually addressing the points being made in the article.  \nSo I'm curious to hear what economists have to say about the things written there.","answer":"You should keep in mind that Einstein, while an excellent physicist, is about as educated in economics as your average Joe, and not instantly credible in the field of economics because he's good at physics. Same goes for an economist regarding physics. If an economist wrote a paper on general relativity with a bit more than average research (that probably isn't correct to begin with), would you take him seriously? Probably not. \n\nIn the article, he seems to be essentially saying that economics is not a real science by comparing it to astronomy, which isn't a very good argument. The field of economics does have a set methodology they use to conduct research. See Econ methodology FAQ in the sidebar of this sub.\n\nHe then appears to make the ethical argument for socialism, which, while completely ok, is outside the scope of economics.\n\nOverall this article isn't much different from any other. It ignores basic economic concepts and instead makes an ethical case, which an economist can't really respond to."}

If they raise rates they crash the housing market &amp; consumer confidence, and if they cut\/do nothing they'll crash the pound even further.\n\nSure we have plenty of world class companies but many assemble goods\/raw materials bought in from abroad (paid for in dollars) and global demographics are not favouring exporters (regardless of what country they're in).\n\nI guess where things are different to the 70's is that labour shortages should persist so we'll probably not see such high unemployment. Inflation is likely to prove very sticky though. I went shopping today and while fruit and vegetables are still affordable things that used to be dirt cheap (like cheese sauce) are only for the super rich now!\n\nIn the medium to long term we're one of the very few countries where renewable energy works (i.e. we have an abundance of water and wind) and going forward can probably out-compete German manufacturing now they'll never again have affordable energy.\n\nIt's a shame because things are actually not to bad in the UK now but the politicians are in the process of wrecking it all."}

{"question":"\n\nPigzbe is a decentralised application that allows people to create their own enclosed, autonomous financial networks and to exchange money within them.   Decentralisation means that no central authority is needed for operation. Anybody can participate and the degree of decentralisation increases as the number of  independent participants grows.  The complexity of linking existing banking systems causes delays and inefficiencies which increase costs to a level that limits practical minimum transaction sizes.\n\nBy employing distributed ledger technology, we circumvent the current convoluted,  centralised global payment infrastructure, creating efficient and trustless networks.  The back-end code that powers the DApp runs autonomously on the decentralised network, rather than on centralised networks such as cloud hosting. The DApp builds on the core technology through Smart Contracts and User Interfaces in order to provide some utility.\n\n","answer":" Pigzbe uses the blockchain to make money transfers within families borderless, safe, and instant.

{"question":"I was reading Yuval Noah Harari's book *Sapiens*, and on page 136, he says, \"...it's a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.\"  There is no specific citation for this in the book, and it caught my eye because I had read that Thomas J. Stanley's book, *The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy,* said that [only 20% of millionaires inherited their riches.](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/0810\/7-millionaire-myths.aspx)\n\nI'm guessing that perhaps Harari is going off the Georgetown study that said [to succeed in America, it’s better to be born rich than smart](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/05\/29\/study-to-succeed-in-america-its-better-to-be-born-rich-than-smart.html) or talented?\n\nWould you say Harari's quote is true?  And is it inconsistent with Stanley's contention?","answer":"I can't speak to the empirical facts, but simple logic decrees that these statements are not necessarily inconsistent:\n\n\"most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family\"\n\nvs. \n\n\"only 20% of millionaires inherited their riches.\"\n\nIt is entirely possible that being born into a rich family carries a host of economic advantages other than inheritance. E.g., children of rich families might go to better schools, get better medical care, better support outside of schools, have wealthier and more influential people in their social networks, and have a better financial safety net if they want to do something risky, like starting a new business or running for political office. Even if no one inherited anything (e.g., if there was a 100% estate tax), you would still expect children of rich families to start out with a considerable advantage in terms of lifetime earnings."}

{"question":"This is one of those questions that ive always been afraid to ask because I feel stupid for not knowing \/ understanding the answer, but it came up in my mind as I was listening to a lecture from Mankiw. \n\nIn that lecture, he said that expanding education would decrease inequality because most of the US' inequality increase from the 70s onward was due to Skill-Biased Technological Change, since technology significantly benefited those with high skills, while those with low skills were more or less left out.\n\nThis makes sense, and I can definitely see why giving low-skilled workers more skills would decrease inequality (as it could help them capture the gains of technology)\n\nbut dont we need low-skilled workers, like in services, for instance? Dont we need taco bell workers, janitors, etc.? If everyone had a college degree or more, who would be \/ who would wanna work in these jobs?","answer":"No (and yes).\r  \nFirst thing is that the price of any good or service in any given market is determined by the supply and demand of that specific service. Labor market, like it or not, is not different. So education and salaries, even if they are correlated since there are factors moderating their relation (like specialization) do not have a causal relationship.\n\n\r  \nSecond, there is a gap between giving somebody high education, and having that person working in jobs related to his high education experience. You may be a mechanical engineer and end up working as a bartender. This is happening in many economies around the globe.\r\n\nWhen you consider a closed environment (let's say that we lock everybody up in X country and nobody can enter or leave) if you give high education to 100% of the population, the only thing that is going to happen, is that these skills will decrease in value as there will be an oversupply, and probably, lack of enough demand. On the other hand, low skilled jobs will be in high demand, so the salaries of the first will go down, and the salaries of low skilled jobs will go up, and eventually, you will have people that are engineers and rather work in a low skilled job. So, no, education does not cause that shortage by itself.\n\n\r  \nBut, and here comes the trick, we don't live in closed environments. If high skilled employees are not paid enough, before going to work to low skilled manual jobs, many will leave the country, and you will have a brain drain."}

{"question":"i’ve seen a bunch of different figures for how much the money supply rose in 2020, but surely if there was a 35% increase in the money supply there’d be an increase of 35% inflation? is that not what the fisher equation shows?","answer":"&gt;is that not what the fisher equation shows?\n\nNo. The fisher eq just states that real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation. The money supply isn't part of that at all.\n\n&gt;but surely if there was a 35% increase in the money supply there’d be an increase of 35% inflation?\n\nNo. First of all, to state the obvious, there isn't.\n\nEverything else being equal and all new money going towards consumption, this would be the case. But everything else *isn't* equal.\n\nMonetary policy doesn't happen in a vacuum, significant changes are usually a response to a change in economic conditions. In this case, the increase was so substantial to avoid the *deflation* that would have occured thanks to the economic shock by the pandemic. You had a fall in output, a fall in how quickly money changed hands, and in response an increase in the money supply.\n\nNotable is also that behaviour in of itself matters. That's why central banks generally try to communicate their policy clearly and try to communicate policy changes ahead of time, so that expectations are in line with it. What people *believe* about inflation changes their actions and alters de facto inflation just as changes in the money supply do.\n\nUltimately in an economy you always have a mix of factors that push inflation up or down, the job of the central bank is to counteract these factors in order to reach their target of low and stable inflation. That's not always a perfect process, central bankers are neither wizards nor can they perfectly anticipate the future, but it does mean that \"why did the central bank alter the money supply\" is an important question to ask."}

{"question":"So my wife has been looking for part time work from home jobs to supplement my income. She found a virtual assistant position and applied.\n\nThe company offered her a position without interviewing her. It's for 6-7 hours a week making hotel and travel reservations. She will be paid $400 a week, and $30 extra per hour over 7 hours as needed.\n\nShe asked some questions and got an odd response that felt canned. Basically she said she would receive a check for $2950 that would cover the first week's pay, the cost of a printer and paper, as well as booking software.\n\nThis all feels like a scam, but I don't know how. Has anyone run into this? What should I be asking\/looking for?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the responses everyone. I should have phrased this a bit differently. I knew this was a scam, I just didn't know how. I appreciate all of the advice for legitimate work from home options.","answer":"This is 8000% a scam, and a very well-known one. Your wife will get a check and be told to cash it and then send $X to the \"printer company\" and keep the rest as her pay. There is no printer company. She is sending money to the scammer. The check will later bounce, and the bank will deduct the full $2950 from her account. She'll then be out the money that she sent for the \"printer,\" and possibly incur overdraft fees as well if it causes an overdraft.\n\nThe way this works is that the scammer uses a bad check, but that looks good enough to pass initial muster. It then gets credited to the account within X business days according to the bank's policy, but just because the money is available in your account doesn't mean a check has actually cleared. It takes a few weeks on the back end to make sure the check is legitimate and the account it's drawn on has sufficient funds to cover it, and once they realize it's no good they pull the money back from the account it was deposited in.\n\nTell her to run from this job, and she can report the person to the police if she wants to, though I doubt they'll actually catch them.

I thought economists were in agreement that rent control was a terrible idea but Vienna seems to be doing [great](https:\/\/www.insider.com\/why-vienna-is-world-most-liveable-city-food-architecture-renting-2020-1). \n\nWhat gives?","answer":"The short answer is that the Viennese government uses a combination of subsidy and direct government construction to get around any negative supply effects caused by rent control.\\* The city itself is also in a lot of ways more free market than most US cities; single-family zoning doesn't exist in Vienna, comparatively around [75% of land zoned for housing in the US is zoned exclusively for single](https:\/\/www.planetizen.com\/definition\/single-family-zoning) family homes; [their building codes are also much more permissive](https:\/\/slate.com\/business\/2021\/12\/staircases-floor-plan-twitter-housing-apartments.html) and allow for cheaper construction than the US; they have much more streamlined building processes.\n\nThe other answer is that they do also have some of the negative characteristics associated with rent control. In particular, they have a two year residency requirement for social housing plus a waitlist. I don't have a source for typical wait times or for how easy it is to get a rental in the private market, though. It's certainly does not seem to be nearly as bad as it is in Sweeden or for trying to get into the US housing voucher system."}

{"question":"So I understand that Bidens tax plan will only affect individual incomes of over $400k, but what about the increase in corporate taxes? There's fear from the opposition that corporate taxes don't truly affect the corporation as much as it eventually affects the consumer. I guess I'm looking for a rebuttal to this point. I can totally envision a major multi million dollar company getting taxed more, but increasing their prices while finding more reasons to go offshore. Thanks and hoping for a prosperous presidency!","answer":"A detailed economic [analysis](https:\/\/budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu\/issues\/2020\/9\/14\/biden-2020-analysis) of the Biden platform was done at the Wharton Business School (Trump's alma mater, ironically), which said the following:\n\n&gt; Under the Biden tax plan, households with adjusted gross income (AGI) of $400,000 per year or less would not see their taxes increase directly but would see lower investment returns and wages as a result of corporate tax increases. Those with AGI at or below $400,000 would see an average decrease in after-tax income of 0.9 percent under the Biden tax plan, compared to a decrease of 17.7 percent for those with AGI above $400,000 (the top 1.5 percent).\n\nIt also summarizes the general impact of the Biden platform, finding that it would result in a reduced debt and increased GDP growth relative to the status quo:\n\n&gt; PWBM finds that over the 10-year budget window 2021 – 2030, the Biden platform would raise $3.375 trillion in additional tax revenue and increase spending by $5.37 trillion. Including macroeconomic and health effects, by 2050 the Biden platform would decrease the federal debt by 6.1 percent and increase GDP by 0.8 percent relative to current law. Almost 80 percent of the increase in taxes under the Biden tax plan would fall on the top 1 percent of the income distribution.\n\nIn short, the Biden tax plan would result in slightly lower wages and returns on investment for those with incomes under $400,000, but would not directly increase their taxes. His platform would also reduce the national debt and boost GDP growth relative to Trump's policies. I hope that answers the question."}

Yet: What I find is that those who lean too much into this logic of optimization are the ones that suffer from a (literal) maddening degree of alienation.\n\nIt's an easy trap to fall into as it is so very *sensible*: Why would you spend six hours cleaning (doing a chore you hate and doing it badly) if you could just work an additional hour and outsource that? So you hire a cleaner. And a cook, a personal shopper, an interior designer and a nanny. But if you don't watch out, all your little self worth eggs, so to speak, are kept in the same work basket - and, step by step, you start to live the life of a stranger. You eat the food of someone else, wear the clothes of not-you, in an apartment that might as well be a hotel room, with kids that are more attached to their nanny than to you. Your vacations are glamorous, but there's little connection to anyone or anything in them. At this point you might start to feel a little unease. You might start to wonder why you're unfulfilled and try to treat yourself better - so you double down. You get a PA because dealing with a schedule is annoying, you get a personal trainer because *mens sana in corpore sano* and while you're at it, you also start therapy, where you learn techniques that help somewhat and where you analyze childhood events. But what somehow is kept at bay, in a fish-not-having-a-word-for-water-way, is that you identify with your job of optimizing processes to maximum efficency to a degree that you treat yourself like any work project.

This is not Instagram.\n\nEdit: \"making ends meet\" meaning trying to hit my investments, earnings and savings targets (not always easy). Some folks are saying I don't belong here, so I want to clarify that I'm currently on the FatFIRE track, but would like to learn more from others - especially those who made it.","answer":"&gt; Lift others up, not bring other down.\n\nWhy does someone posting about their success in a forum intended for that “bring other down”?\n\nSome people have nobody they can tell or talk to, and just want to share their success. They’re not doing it for you, they are doing it for them, and I’m not sure why there would be a problem with that."}
{"question":"I’m a millennial who has been slowly clawing his way out of the lower class for the better part of 10 years now, and am finally in the position to look at buying a first home. Other than the fact that I still probably won’t be able to afford one at this point, my main gripe (and a common one I’ve heard among almost everyone in my peer group) is that everything is gray. Specifically this ugly vinyl gray mock-wood flooring that is in literally almost every home I’m looking at. I just want to cry out “please STOP”… Like if I’m going to have to pay $250k for a 2 bedroom shoebox in OMAHA in 2022 the last thing I want to do is rip out the new floors you just put in and repaint everything :((\n\n\/end rant","answer":"The force is strong with the gray shit. Worse yet is the ceramic gray tile intended to look like wood. Typically installed by amateurs and a bitch to remove. Id rather have a bare sub floor to work with."}
{"question":"Sure, we'd all feel the pain, but apparently we need the pain, and we wouldn't have to help an industry that won't give even one sick day to rail workers.  Are interest rate hikes the only acceptable mechanism to control inflation?","answer":"It should be noted that a rail strike wouldn't necessarily reduce inflation, as it would slow down shipping for both intermediate products for production and final products to market. The former would impact production costs and increase prices as a result, whereas the latter would reduce market supply and increase prices as well. The result would most likely be higher prices for goods and an economic downturn as a result of businesses struggling to ship cross-country and consumers struggling to buy affected goods.\n\n(I should note that threatening to strike is not necessarily a bad thing, and I support rail workers in their strike action should they choose to take it. Given the importance of rail infrastructure for cross-country shipping and given the threat that a work stoppage would pose for the economy, it should go without saying that the workers that operate that system should be taken seriously and given what are ultimately pretty small demands anyways, especially in the context of labour provisions provided in other OECD countries.)"}
{"question":"Hi all,\n\nSo I have been observing GBP, EUR and USD and dollar and euro are now 1 to 1 which didn't happen for a long time (Probably to Russia\/Ukraine things going on) but I don't get why GBP soon will be 1 to 1 to the dollar as well?\n\nI am no expert in economics but from my understanding, it is quite worrying as such things didn't happen for more than 20 years. \n\nWould that mean that currencies\/markets will crash soon? or if not what could be the major change in the economy since GBP\/EURO\/USD will be all 1 to 1?","answer":"1) The ECB and BoE were also running fairly loose monetary policy\n\n2) The Fed is tightening monetary policy more aggressively than BoE and ECB\n\n3) The UK and EU are highly dependent on oil &amp; gas imports, whereas the US is a net exporter of gas and more balanced in oil, so the Ukraine war has dealt a more severe terms of trade shock to the UK and EU than to the US"}

So now that you no longer have to a lot if past decisions are no longer relevant (eg buying a house near work, stuff like that.)\n\nTakes awhile to unwind. \n\nAt same time you don’t want to just sit bored, so your new job is to rethink everything slowly until you figure out a new mission for your life."}

{"question":"JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said on Monday the investment bank is sitting on $500 billion in cash in anticipation of higher inflation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has been \"effectively stockpiling more and more cash\" in anticipation of investing at higher rates rather than putting money into Treasuries and other investments now, he said at Morgan Stanley's US Financials, Payments &amp; Commercial Real Estate Conference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We have a lot of cash and capability and we're going to be very patient, because I think you have a very good chance inflation will be more than transitory,\" Dimon, the longest-serving CEO among the big US banks, said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInflation means fiat is worth less, no?

You you could at that point (arguably) get a better rate of return on a fixed income (in theory, less risk) instrument rather than risk it in current markets. \n\n This all means there will be a correction (who’s size is unknown but sounds like dimon is betting it will be on the big end), which is what he’s hoping for to put that extra cash to work"}

{"question":"[This argument for mandating 100% reserve requirements is compelling to me.](https:\/\/blog.p2pfoundation.net\/the-100-reserve-requirement-for-banks-a-proposal-by-herman-daly\/2010\/05\/08) It makes me wonder why banks were allowed to do anything else in the first place. Why is this allowed?","answer":"In essence, reserve requirements are not going to be 100% for the same reason that we won’t require insurance companies to have a 100% reserve: the chances of a simultaneous withdrawal at 100% is almost infinitesimally small, and the chances of it happening across the whole financial system would imply we were on the verge of complete societal collapse already.\n\nSo what do we get from giving up the 100% reserve requirement? Now banks can do things with your money- they can offer loans (generally good for the economy that we have credit) and they are happy to hold your money for free.\n\nWhat would happen if the reserve requirement was 100%? As banks can no longer loan out your money, they’d likely want to charge you (potentially exorbitant) fees to go through the process of holding and securing it. Loans would have to come entirely from financial capital already owned by lenders, which would massively reduce the supply of credit. \n\nAll in all, the benefits outweigh the risks."}

So while more companies will think about outsourcing, I doubt we will see a drastic shift. \n\nBut what could happen is overall wage reduction for remote workers if they move out of the expensive areas like the Bay area into more rural lands. A lot of people would take that pay cut if rent was cheaper. \n\n\nAnd also lets not forget other issues with remote work that will force companies to call everyone back into the office when they can.

That being said, a majority of my studies revolve around measuring\/improving social welfare, and on the theory side, maximizing social welfare.

{"question":"Hello all,\n\nCurious if anybody in here has gone the route of building a portfolio centred around dividends.\n\nTo this point, I’ve got a few rental properties, one full Bitcoin, and a few ETFs like xaw, xuu, vee, vcn. I’m completely ok with risk. I’m a buy-and-hold guy. But I’ve gotten to wondering what it might be like to make dividends a centrepiece of my portfolio. This will be in addition to rental incomes and equity draw-downs.\n\nHas anybody here invested primarily for dividends? What does your portfolio look like? Have you had significant regrets about this kind of portfolio construction?\n\n27 years old, looking to retire (or semi-retire) by 2030. I put away 45-55k in savings a year.\n\nThanks in advance; good luck out there.\n\nP.S. You folks are awesome. So many impressive portfolios and perspectives in the replies below. I hope your investments continue to work magic!","answer":"Our country has various benefits for why dividend investing should be a top priority for each Canadian. For example our dividend tax is 30% as opposed to Americans at 50% and companies that pay 4%+ dividends are usually one of very few in a controlled market. \n\nI pick what I believe to be the best company in each sector that shows growth of dividends, revenue, income, equity, over at least a 10 year timeframe. Why care about the latter 3 you may ask? Because of my goals!\n\nMy goals: \n\n1. Capital preservation - every investor should hold their first goal in investing as being able to preserve their original investment. By investing in only high dividend yielding stocks, you risk your actual equity side of the investment because usually these companies focused on solely dividends issue debt in order to keep paying them out to attract shareholders. A quick indicator of this is happening is to check the payout ratio (should be 50-70% for traditional companies).\n\n2. Dividend income - obviously this is the another reason why you would be looking at building such a portfolio. Try to aim for 4%+ dividend yield! I wouldn’t exclude solid companies that can make your portfolio more defensive just cause they have low dividend yields, you can always balance it out if you are creative.\n\n3. Capital appreciation - Not sure what planet some people may be coming from but it’s not a good look to have bought a stock 20 years ago and today it’s trading at the same price. They should be at least keep up with inflation (2%) otherwise your money is slowly getting burned. To determine how you can find a company with solid capital appreciation and solid dividends, just take a look at consistencies in revenue and income growth. \n\nThe portfolio:\n\nFortis - 47 years of dividends  nuff said it’s literally a linear regression, if you are really picky buy when it taps the EMA on the monthly (hint: just did a few days ago). Pays 4% dividend and ppl need to pay their power bill it’s a century trade. \n\nTD - Guess what? We have some of the greatest financial institutions in the entire world based on regulation and accountability! imo this bank is the best in Canada going forward with the highest revenue, income growth in their industry whilst continuing to pay dividends. Kinda rare to see such massive growth for a Canadian company especially a bank but this is because they are focused on our neighbours down south! RBC is a close second but I like the colour green baby $$$. Pays 4% dividend\n\nEnbridge - just lol. This industry was beaten to a pulp from our government and it isn’t a good look to be invested in. They pay a solid dividend at 6-7% and are throwing most of their remaining cash into projects that will create more renewable infrastructure. Their management doesn’t have to lie to their shareholders cause they aren’t directly in on oil so they can tell them, “look 2050 our revenue is gonna be nearly 100% renewable”. These guys are in it for the long hall - this I evaluate as my riskier bet but the high dividend yield will allow me to pick a super conservative stock that has low dividend (2%) to balance out back to our 4%.\n\nCNR - speaking of conservative stocks we got CNR it’s I think the widest moat and hardest hurdle to jump into the ring with because who in their right mind is gonna put up $100B in CAPEX to build a railroad, plus jump through all the provincial legislation hoops, and all the aborigines treaties. Yeah not likely right? CP was the only other company I considered for this sector nothing wrong with that company but I needed a purely safe bet to balance out “risk on” bets so here we are. I think it pays 2% dividend\n\nBAM.A - this is just a sexy stock honestly and it gives you exposure into real estate among various other businesses internationally without getting destroyed by crap management, large issuance of debt, and dividend baiting. This is the growthiest stock of them all and they also pay roughly 2% yield. \n\nBCE - high dividend at 6% yield, biggest telecom in Canada, 5G coming, tbh not really all that excited with where cable is going in the future so I may transition this into Telus because I see more growth through their wireless and teledoc initiatives.\n\nManulife - this is your unsexy boring insurance company stock but hey they got great constant growth over the years and pay a dividend that meets our goal of 4% so let’s pick it up\n\nAlgonquin - they got rekt from I think the texas power outage if I’m not mistaken recently? So good buying opportunity. Same sort of idea - high revenue growth, high dividend growth, only concern is the income growth this is I believe the lowest income generator based on market cap and revenue compared to the rest in the list. Also if you aren’t comfortable with so much overlap you already have fortis and BAM.A which owns BIP which owns utilities too. This you can leave out and toss more into fortis or Brookfield."}
{"question":"Throwaway account but I was an early employee at a tech startup that has gone public recently. I left a few years ago and worked at some other well know companies which I’ve made some money from as well. \n\nNow I’m 32 with 8 figures but still living in a $2k apartment in San Francisco and single. Weird. \n\nIt seems silly to try to win lottery another time so feels like my time as a traditionally employed mid level person is probably ending soon. Have no aspiration to be an executive of any kind unless I’m the founder. But I haven’t really planned for a different life as of yet. \n\nWhat should my first step be to figure things out? Maybe start going to therapy on the regular.","answer":"Hey, I had a similar situation to you. Made 8 figures at the age of 27 from working at a successful startup. Lived in a $2k apartment and had a serious girlfriend at the time.\n\nThis windfall will change your life dramatically, in ways you can’t even imagine today. It has taken me years to get acclimated to a new lifestyle... one that is filled with different possibilities, different opportunities, different friendships, different power dynamics, different social influence, different lovers than ever before.\n\nMy advice to you would be to take it slowly. Don’t make any drastic decisions. You’re young, what’s the rush? To the best of your abilities, pretend like the money doesn’t exist for awhile. This will allow you to carefully navigate the transition and reflect at each step of the way — what kind of person do you want to be? Do you want to be a rich asshole or a kind, humble and caring? Do you want to buy a Ferrari or drive a Tesla Model 3? To be clear, these are rhetorical questions. What I’m saying is that you should critically analyze the choices you make at each step of the way, and think about what it means for the person you’re growing into. I believe this slow and steady introspection will lead you to the right path.\n\nSo why not keep working your current job for now? Why not stay at your current apartment for a little while?\n\nFor me, I kept my job and ended up finding deep fulfillment learning how to build effective teams and how to empower others. I stayed in my $2k apartment for a year or so, and then upgraded to a multi-million dollar house. I realized who my true friends really are. I found love. I constantly reflected on the person I was becoming, and found deeper purpose in life.\n\nThat’s what worked for me, anyways. Your mileage may vary. Congrats and good luck!"}

{"question":"Productivity in Brazil has been stagnant for 30 years. We were richer than China in the early 1990s, but now we are humiliated in every way. Why did this happen?","answer":"A failure to climb the value chain. [Here](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b9\/Rank_in_the_Economic_Complexity_Index%2C_OWID.svg) is a map of countries by economic complexity - the diversity of skills, knowledge, and productive capabilities in a country. From the [full list](https:\/\/atlas.cid.harvard.edu\/rankings), Japan is #1, South Korea #4, China #16, and Brazil #53, behind famously commodity-dependent Russia. Brazil's [top exports](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1191541\/products-exported-from-brazil\/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Brazil%20most%20exported,U.S.%20dollars%20worth%20of%20exports.) are agricultural and raw materials, while China's [top exports](https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/china\/exports) are all manufactured goods. Contra popular belief, the bulk of these now adays are not labor intensive consumer products, but capital intensive and complex products: the top 5 are mechanical &amp; industrial products, machinery &amp; transport equipment, high tech products, automatic data processing equipment, and cell phones.\n\nIt should be noted as well that countries like Japan, South Korea, and China are the exception, where Brazil is the norm. Countless other promising economies like Turkey, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, and even India have been trapped in boom and bust cycles.\n\nUnderstanding this requires an understanding of the different economic strategies employed. Until 1931, the economic reputation of Japan was the same as that of Brazil today: the country of the future... and always would be. It was fueled by exports of labor intensive industrial products, silk, and rayon. The barriers to entry in this business were low and a few large companies controlled the international distribution chain, just as a few large trading firms control the exports of Brazilian agricultural and mineral products today. The result was low profits and frequent market crashes whenever the international market worsened.\n\nFrom 1931 to 1954, Japanese bureaucrats tested and perfected a strategy to climb the value chain and shift to more capital intensive industries with higher barriers to entry. It involved 1) limiting competition in low-barrier industries to increase the rate of profit, 2) channeling profits from low-barrier industries into \"strategic sectors\": the next rung on the value chain (i,e. textiles to steel, steel to machinery, machinery to consumer appliances, consumer appliances to automobiles), and 3) restricting foreign competition in strategic sectors until they could *outcompete* foreigners. This strategy was imitated by South Korea and later China.\n\nIt of course had downsides. For one, restricting competition in a low-barrier industry is tantamount to imposing a consumption tax on the public: they bear the burden of higher prices. Restricting imports also increases prices until local strategic sectors can mature. Finally, in the short-term, this policy defies comparative advantage: strategic sectors begin very inefficient. It only succeeded because, over time, the \"experience curve\" (brief summary of the concept [here](https:\/\/hbr.org\/1985\/03\/building-strategy-on-the-experience-curve)) changes comparative advantages over time.\n\nUnderstanding its advantages is less straightforward. As mentioned, industries up the value chain have higher barriers to entry, so they tend to also have higher margins, but not always. More importantly, compensation is better. Economic growth is highly counter-intuitive. Most people will interpret \"6% growth\" as \"the average person in country X is getting 6% richer a year\". In practice, it's more like 6% of the people have seen their incomes increase greatly this year, while most people's real incomes have barely changed. Assume you live in a town with a textile mill where most workers are being paid $15 an hour. A windshield glass factory opens next door and offers $30 and a sizable share of the town's incomes have doubled. The impression often given by economists is that the face of economic growth is that textile mill getting more and more efficient, when in practice it's that glass factory opening and doubling local wages. \n\nThat glass factory starts with a far higher input cost than its competitors due to being on the left hand of the experience curve, but over time equalizes with them. In that time, it either requires huge amounts of capital to stay afloat, unnatural advantages like government subsidies, free land, or tax benefits, or both. Japan, South Korea, and China had their attention on building the glass factories and giving them that capital and those unnatural advantages: uncompetitive trade policies, free land harborside, infrastructural development meant to lower transportation costs specifically around a few industrial parks, hostile labor policy, and tax incentives (including tax deductions on buying their products) all but guaranteed those industries would be in the black from day 1, even if their methods were very inefficient. Then, when they became more efficient, they became dominant in export markets for a while, both because they still had *most* of these advantages (though would lose \"strategic sector\" privileges shortly after this point), and because wages hadn't caught up with the rest of the world.\n\nAs wages rose and certain industries stopped becoming profit leaders, *they* would then become the new \"textile industry\" and see competition limited and profits redirected to fund a new class of \"strategic sectors\". The state in Japan, China, and South Korea managed a never-ending cannibalism of industries to fund increasingly capital-intensive ones.\n\nThe growth model in boom and bust dependent \"failed miracle economies\" was very different. In Turkey and Brazil, just to give two examples, growth was typically driven by FDI. That FDI took advantage of relatively low wages, and, in some areas, relatively high levels of skill and education to create export-oriented businesses. Those businesses would then turn a profit for a while, but the influx of foreign capital into the country increased the value of the currency, and thereby decreased competitive of exports. Eventually, black balance sheets would go red and foreign investors would flee. These economies crashed into low wages and cheap currency again and once again became attractive to investors, so this cycle started over. All the while there were only very limited attempts to \"collect\" profits of industries further down the value chain and establish higher value chain industries: the only real initiative to do this were the establishment of a few public sector firms (on a much smaller order of magnitude than what was happening in East Asia) and periods of increased investment in education.\n\nThe difference between the rare miracle economies and the mass of disappointments came down to political incentives. Too often this is oversimplified to \"dictatorships focus on the long term while democracies focus on the short term\": this ignores the fact that most of the world's poor countries are dictatorships. Rather, we have to adopt a nuanced understanding of Northeast Asian governments during the boom years. They were not democracies where leaders are accountable to the public (even Japan is essentially a one party state), nor were they \"traditional\" autocracies where the leader is accountable to no one. Rather, for thousands of years, Confucian rulers have been accountable to *the palace*. The expectation has always been that the top leader is the public face of the regime but allows his ministers to govern autonomously, controlling only who gets promoted and fired. Whenever a leader - even an absolute monarch - lacks virtue or ability, there is a long tradition of his ministers either removing him or turning him into a puppet (we've seen this even in modern years with Jiang Zemin). The result in all the Asian miracle economies was an \"economic general staff\" that ran the country with 10 and 20 year timetables in mind, and that was relatively insulated from politics."}

{"question":"I can't understand very well why workers simply don't get a raise according to inflation for every year of work. I'm not so cynical that I think that companies are simply exploiting more more from the workers, but it does seem very suspicious that it's hard to get a raise in the same position after a year, even if it's just to stay even with inflation. \n\nSo what could be a possible consequence if, say, everyone got a raise very year according to a given inflation index?

Inflation happens, which forces companies to raise wages, which leads to further inflation, until you end up in a situation where wages keeping up with inflation is the least of your problems. The currency goes down the drain, imports get super expensive, lending unreasonable, etc.\n\nSecond of all, wages are rigid downward. People don't like wage cuts, surprise. Inflation helps companies during downturns by lowering real wages, and helps them to avoid firing people or going under instead.\n\nThird of all, what about dying industries? Eventually the revenue you generate falls below your wage, right now you'd still have the choice to accept a lower wage, if you couldn't cut wages, people would against just get fired.\n\nMedian real wage growth is usually positive, wages *do* keep up with inflation, just not always and not immediately."}

{"question":"There are a lot of people in [this post](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/oe89i4\/rgaming_argues_about_a_16yearold_scalper_who_has\/) who are angry at scalpers. And I get that, if you have to pay 2x MSRP for a PS5 then of course it doesn’t feel good. \n\nBut that’s *literally* what happens in a shortage. You aren’t able to get things \n\nHowever, what a lot of these people seem to get wrong is that, even if scalpers *didn’t* exist, it would have no effect on the supply. There would still be the same number of PS5s as before. You wouldn’t have a better chance of getting a PS5.\n\nWhen scalpers exist to regulate the free market, the person with the highest marginal value for a PS5 will be able to get it. When scalpers don’t exist, the same thing will happen. Sure, people would resell the goods but people would pay in other ways—for example by waiting in line longer. \n\nThis is all basic economics. Am I just stupid or do most redditors not understand basic economics concepts like this?","answer":"Think of it this way, every individual who is able to purchase a console at the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), despite being willing to pay more, would experience an economic gain. Every additional dollar they have to pay to a scalper reduces their economic gain and increases the scalper's.\n\nIf you would pay $1,000 for a console, but are able to get it for only $500, that's an extra $500 in your pocket and possibly some intangible happiness. If you have to pay $1,000 for the console, you realize no gain. Even though the market as a whole might be functioning efficiently in the latter scenario where you pay $1k, a rational consumer would prefer the former where they realize a gain.\n\nWhile the actions of the scalper might be rational, his profit is in some cases derived from the losses of people who would have otherwise been able to purchase the console at MSRP. While the scalpers don't affect total supply, they do affect demand, which can increase the market price.\n\nI think what you have to understand is that while this does seem rational from the perspective of the free market in basic economics, the real world is composed of individuals who are subject individual gains and losses as well as location differences, search costs, and expectations.\n\nLet's consider how some of these other things can affect individual opinions against the behaviors of a rational economic actor like a scalper:\n\n1. Location Differences - While you're correct that the scalper's actions will not have any effect on overall supply, they can impact local supply and demand. When some profit-seeking individuals purchase large quantities of these consoles, they can reduce the quantity of consoles available in their local area, because the scalper might be able to make a greater profit selling it online to a different city or state. A Walmart in Giddings, Texas might receive a limited quantity of PS5s because of the relatively small population and median household income of [$44,000](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/quickfacts\/fact\/table\/giddingscitytexas\/IPE120219v). A scalper who purchases all of their consoles and sells them to individuals in New York City with a median income of [$64,000](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/quickfacts\/fact\/table\/newyorkcitynewyork\/IPE120219) might price them above what an individual in Giddings is able to pay. While it makes sense for the scalper from an economic perspective, individuals in certain locations might not appreciate being forced to compete with other areas earning higher median incomes.\n2. Search Costs - Some consumers are not price sensitive, so the search costs for a console are minimal, because they're willing to pay the market price of a console on an auction site. For these consumers, scalpers can provide a valuable service by drastically reducing their cost (time spent) searching for a console.  \nOther consumers who are price sensitive might only be willing to purchase a console if it's below a certain price. For them, the added demand from scalpers and potentially reduced local supply of consoles can increase their costs of searching for a console.\n3. Expectations are an important part of economics that can influence opinion and behavior. In this case, people expect to be able to purchase a console at MSRP, and scalpers are economic agents who act explicitly for the purpose of selling consoles above MSRP. The actions of the scalper undermine peoples' expectations of what they feel is fair, which could explain the overwhelming negative response.\n\nEven though the actions of the scalper are rational due to limited supply, some individuals bear the economic costs of their actions either through a higher purchase price, lack of a local supply, or increased search costs. Additionally, many people expect being able to purchase a console at MSRP, and might view the actions of the scalper as undermining their expectations.\n\n*Edit: I focused my comment on why people might justifiably be angry at scalpers, but as* u\/YaYaOnTour *correctly pointed out in their* [*comment*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/oenoun\/am_i_just_dumb_or_does_reddit_really_not\/h482so4)*, a more complete response should have mentioned that scalpers create a benefit for people who are willing to pay more for a console but unable to find one. I made that a bit clearer in the section on Search Costs.*"}
{"question":"My girlfriend has this political opinion that every person should be paid the exact same wage, no matter what job they do. I don’t know enough about economics to explain why this wouldn’t work. Looking for some insight.","answer":"Here are a few common problems people bring up about this kind of proposal:\n\n1) Jobs that are more difficult, [more dangerous](https:\/\/advisorsmith.com\/data\/most-dangerous-jobs\/), or just more unpleasant will not be filled now.  We call the difference in salary needed to get someone to do these jobs \"compensating wage differentials\".  Who would go down in the coal mines, fight in the army, work with toxic chemicals all day, or clean out the clogs in the sewer system?\n\n2) What about people who start their own business?  Exact same wage implies that there will be no reward for doing this.  Who will work hard to invent better ways of doing things (or curing cancer)?  Again, with no reward system available, it isn't going to happen.\n\n3) There is no incentive to **work hard**, either. With no way of getting raises, no way of getting a promotion, it is difficult to see why people would *work hard*.  Everyone might phone it in, all the time.  What are you going to do to me if I don't do any work at all?  I can always get another job making exactly the same thing. (This is the **opposite** of the \"efficiency wage\" idea, where you might pay someone more just for the fact that they will work harder to avoid losing the job.)\n\n4) \"But human beings just love working, and will do all of these things anyway\", your girlfriend says. Sadly. most people do not agree.  I would be searching for the cushiest job I would enjoy the most (petting kittens, playing competitive video games whether I'm any good or not, be a member of a band), and will do the minimum I have to. \n\n5) What about jobs that require 6-10 years of schooling and training before you ever get paid?  Are we going to pay the students the same amount as well?  Then, I change my answer-- I will be a student for the rest of my life.  I will be really good at it though!\n\n6) Think about this \"same wage\", what we will be paying a 16 year old kid. What about a single mother who has 5 kids?  What about a single father who went to Med school with 5 kids who is also responsible for taking care of his parents? You are going to limit him to the same salary, so that they now starve?\n\n7) What about people who earn money on Patreon or similar platforms? What about people who are really good at earning tips because they do a great job?  Are we making laws preventing people from voluntarily giving other people money? \n\n8) Finally-- many people who make the \"same wage\" argument are also in favor of confiscating all the wealth, and dividing it equally among everyone.

My father invested in the market and taught me to do the same. Born during the depression, he quit junior year of high school to help support his family when my grandfather suffered a stroke. Needless to say he worked blue collar jobs and long hours at that. He swore he would never be poor again. Understandably, my father was always a saver. He researched how to invest in the market and in the late 60s he started investing in stocks that paid dividends.  He didn’t make much money but he managed to save small amounts to invest. When he worked overtime or had extra cash he invested it and over the years continued to drip. Growing up we lived comfortably but not extravagantly. On top of an impressive portfolio my father built on his own research and knowledge, my parents managed to purchase 2 homes, pay for my entire education (masters in art education) as well as my brother (doctor of veterinary medicine). They were able to retire in their 50s and live off  SOME of the dividends while continuing to drip others. Neither had a job that paid a pension. My father started an IRA for him and my mother. My mom passed in 2008 (portfolio took a hit) but my father didn’t flinch as he survived many bear markets. My father passed December 2021 with the legacy of his impressive portfolio worth millions while accomplishing all he set out to achieve by saving and investing in dividend paying stocks which was the best strategy for him!  Keep up the great work!"}

Unemployed people are not doing \"nothing\"; they're looking for work. Benefits expire after a said period of time. UI benefits are meant to smooth consumption while you're looking for a job.\n2. There's evidence that UI improves the quality of your search. People with benefits find jobs that they are better-qualified for, have higher wages, and\/or longer tenure. This is good for the labor market because it means the right people are being matched with the right job, and increases what we call \"match quality\".\n3. Human capital (like skills) are occupation specific i.e. people are good at what they do. There's a lot of research demonstrating that exogenous (as in random) occupation switches lead to long term loss in wage prospects and job quality.

While Nifty may have 8~13% return rate when averaged over next 20 years, the individual years may have wildly varying returns... A series of negative return years, say -20%, -10%, -30% followed by some very good years might wreck your financial plan. You still will have to withdraw 15k per month to pay off your EMI. Sequence of returns is very important, more important than averaged returns over x years... \n\nCombine both scenarios and you are looking at more trouble. \n\nIf you look at investing part of the portfolio in some debt instrument for \"safety\"  then the averaged out return may not be enough to justify the time and  effort involved."}
{"question":"i.e. What have economists discovered in the last 50 years?\n\nA lot has happened since the 1970s, like the two oil shocks, US stagflation, fall of the Soviet Union, 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nHas economics undergone any fundamental shifts over this period of time? Has there been any breakthroughs or major shifts of thought?","answer":"Economics is *very* different than it was 50 years ago. Microeconomics, for instance, has undergone a drastic shift. Microeconomic theory in the 1970s was very much what you might call \"classical\" microeconomic theory- there was still a large focus on consumer and producer theory that underpins general equilibrium, and decision theory was still an active subfield. \n\nSince then, microeconomics evolved; many of the issues in decision theory were worked on and resolved (or at least resolved enough that economists figured further inquiry would be largely mathematical exercises of little real interest). Further, game theory rose to forefront of microeconomic theory and took over the field and has *almost* gotten to the point of exhausting it's traditional lines of inquiry (e.g. game theorists have moved away from a lot of traditional approaches to mechanism design to focus instead on more exotic approaches that yield \"worse case\" bounds or robust mechanisms; good examples of this would be the work of Bergemann or Brooks). Behavioral and Experimental economics (in many ways deeply related to microeconomic theory) became a field, and some of the results (such as Vernon Smith's stock market experiments with ASU undergrads) were deeply shocking to the field (among other things, this experiment exhibited evidence of bubbles arising even in relatively simple settings). \n\nEconometrics evolved as well. For one, in the most recent two or three decades, there's been an explosion of interest in causality on all levels. This means on a philosophical level, on an estimation level, on an implementation level, and in specific particularized applied problems. This has led to drastic advances in econometric methods, giving the applied researcher a very powerful toolbox as well as something of a guide to best practices in experimental implementation (thanks to the work of people like Duflo and Banerjee in doing so many experiments and learning the good practices the hard way). The combination of this interest in experiments, good guidelines, and strong tools for estimation has allowed us to answer questions we would have found impossible to answer before: what is the impact of UBI? Which aid programs to developing countries are most effective at increasing health outcomes? etc. Of course, as an econometrician, I find the theoretical advances that this has brought more interesting, but most people care less about that. Other things of note in econometrics are the rise and fall of a whole theoretical subfield, that of time series analysis (much like decision theory, there *was* a lot of productive work, but most of the questions have been exhausted). Whole nonparametric methods of estimation have come into style, gone out of style, and come back into style in the last 50 years- a good example would be neural networks, which actually saw pioneering work in the early 90s by an *econometrician* who would later go on to win the Nobel Prize for his many *other* contributions. \n\nFinally, macroeconomic theory is a very different beast than it was 50 years ago. Stagflation and the Lucas critique led to a drastic underlying shift in macroeconomic theory which pulled the field towards microfounded models beginning in the early 80s. While early microfounded models got a lot of well deserved flak, they eventually became an essential part of modern macroeconomic research, and in recent years, the most advanced of these models have become as good at forecasting as the traditional gold standard, VARs. Moving away from macroeconomic \"methods\" and more to macroeconomic \"facts\", many of the crises you mentioned have been taken in stride by macroeconomists in pursuit of understanding economic dynamics. There are certain macroeconomists who constantly emphasize the tightly related role that oil shocks seem to play in the business cycle (one prominent macroeconometrician in particular who emphasizes this that comes to mind is Jim Hamilton). The 2008 financial crisis spurred a whole host of literature on financial networks, systemic risk, and macroprudential policy; the low interest rate environment that results from the GFC spurred research into macroeconomic policy at the zero lower bound (when interest rates are nominally 0). The \"lost decade\" of Japan led to the now Nobel prize winning research of Ben Bernanke on interest rate targeting and forward guidance, research that would inform his actions during and after the GFC.\n\nAll this is to say that economics is a very large and very active field, and if you were a newly minted PhD student in 1972, there's a huge chance that much of what you learned as being the leading edge of economics would be seen as being so outdated as to not even justify inclusion (or inclusion to a significant degree) in the standard first year PhD sequence."}

{"question":"I’m in a microeconomic class right now and I feel like all of this would be so much easier\/intuitive\/effective if we used calculus. Elasticity, marginal benefit, everything. There’s no way this can be used in the real world without calculus right?  Why isn’t the class taught with calculus in mind.","answer":"It depends on the country and the university. In the US, Intro Micro is usually taught without calculus, but Intermediate usually is with calculus (but certainly not always). In some engineering focused universities in the US (e.g. MIT) and most European ones (from what I have heard), they use calculus in intro micro. \n\nI am in the US, and in my intro classes that don't require calculus I briefly go through the idea of taking the derivative of a total revenue function to get marginal revenue, so they can see where the \"twice the slope is demand is linear\" rule comes from. Probably 80% of my students have seen calculus before they take it.\n\nAs to \"Why no calc?\", there are too many college degrees in the US that don't require any calculus classes at all, and many of those majors also require some kind of introductory economics course (e.g. some management degrees, political science, construction management)."}
{"question":"I'm not terribly versed on this stuff, I'm aware my question might be naïve. $1.5 trillion dollars seems an absolutely astronomical sum - I've seen it pointed out that it's as much as the total amount of student loan debt in the US. My question is - if this money doesn't represent taxes paid or goods exchanged or whatever, what does it even represent? Where does it come from? Who gets to \"keep\" this money and spend it going forward? Is the fed just essentially devaluing everyone's existing dollars in order to keep the bond market going? \n\nTangential question to help me understand this: Would it be possible for the Fed to inject $1.5T into, say, infrastructure?","answer":"The 1.5T is essentially short term loans to big banks to stabilize their balance sheets, so that nobody worries about their ability to pay or worries the banks will be unstable.  These types of short term loans will be repaid in the very short term, it seems like between a few days to a few months."}

When the company recruiter asked me what my target salary was, I responded by asking, \"What is the range for the position?\" to which they responded with their target, which was $30k more than I was expecting\/am making now. Essentially, if I would have given the range I was hoping for (even if it was +$10k more than I am making it now) I still would have sold myself short. \n\nGranted, this is just an interview and not an offer- but I'm happy knowing that I didn't lowball myself from the getgo. ","answer":"This is another frustrating thing about those online form type applications. Many ask you to input a salary requirement and many of those won't let you input something like \"Negotiable\" as they only take hard numbers.

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.” "}

{"question":"Probably a very stupid question and even more philosophical than economic, but are there theories or even proof that Supply and Demand is a law that applies to nature as well?","answer":"What an interesting question! One way to look at the law of supply and demand is as a law about what the **optimal quantity** to be supplied based on the benefits to the supplier is. If the supplier produces more than that quantity, they will either have a surplus, meaning unnecessary costs, or reduced benefit, since it will have to discount the supply to get rid of all of it. If a supplier produces too little, they miss out on potential benefits.  \nFrom the perspective of the consumer, if they consume below the optimal quantity, they're missing out on a trade that would make them better off. If they over consume, they have spent more resources than they like.\n\nTo see how this might play out in nature, consider a flowering tree and a bee. The bees are consumers, using energy to fly from flower to flower (price) in order to consume nectar from the flowers. The tree is the supplier, using energy to produce flowers, and gaining the benefit of pollination from the bees (price). If the tree produces too many flowers, the bees will only visit the easiest ones, so there is a surplus. The law of supply and demand doesn't say that the tree will produce the right number of flowers, or that the bee will visit the right number, just that there is an equilibrium value."}
{"question":"So, pardon my ignorance, but we are essentially borrowing $6 trillion from who exactly?  And what does that mean on top of what we already owe?\n\nThe further I look into this, it just seems like a shell game.  I mean, who the fuck borrows $28 trillion dollars, who is lending that, and who the hell is going to call out on that eventually?","answer":"The US mostly finances it's debt via bonds. So they sell bonds to literally the highest bidder, and pay them back once they reach maturity.\n\nWho owns those bonds? Well, more or less anyone who wants can buy them, people, companies, foreign investors, etc.\n\nThat said, most of this debt is held by the American public.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124\n\nHow is it paid? Well, you have to keep in mind that this isn't one big loan, it's hundreds of thousands of bonds. It's not paid back all at once, either. The cost of the debt isn't really the 28 trillion, it's what it costs to service that debt.\n\nAnd it's paid by mostly tax dollars. Current tax dollars and future tax dollars. And especially with things like infrastructure investments, what matters is how much you get in return, meaning how much you invest into the economy and how much economic growth you get for that.\n\nIn that regard, the US has a pretty good track record. Because debt is generally cheap for the US, because it's literally the most reliable debtor there is, so rates are low, and because returns are good, leading to a cost that's ultimately the vast majority of the time either negative or slightly positive.\n\nhttps:\/\/fredblog.stlouisfed.org\/2018\/11\/how-expensive-is-it-to-service-the-national-debt\/"}
{"question":"It's common sense personal finance advice to build enough of an emergency fund to last a few months, but clearly institutions don't act the same way because otherwise the Fed wouldn't be forced to intervene so heavily in the repo market. Is it fair to draw analogies between short-term liquidity facilities and payday\/title loans? Is the expectation of cheap institutional credit disincentivizing the long-term planning that we encourage from individuals, and does this cost the economy in the long run?","answer":"It's important to remember the difference between liquidity and solvency. It's not that companies are at risk of going bankrupt due to bad managment, its a sudden demand shock thats hurting them. They just need cash to hold them over until things normalise.\n\nSo that leads to the question; why don't companies keep rainy day funds? \n\nNow a lot of people on reddit will start harping on about stock buy-backs and corperate evil and stuff like that, but it's actually a lot simpler. \n\nLeaving cash sitting around in a bank account waiting for a rainy day is a bad investment, like an awful investment. Say you run a cafe, any extra cash you have lying around can probably be invested back into you business, buy a better coffee machine, upgrade your kitchen, ect. Now for a cafe there's only so many things you can spend your money on, but for a massive international firm there are always ways to invest that money. And if you as a company don't have anything good to invest in then you can pay money to your shareholders and let them invest in new things. Money sitting in a bank account isn't doing anyone any good, if we did what some morons on latestagecapialism are suggesting and made companies have rainy day funds that would tie up billions (maybe even trillions) of dollars in the economy (and fuck with interest rates)."}

{"question":"In the fine 1964 film Goldfinger, James Bond and the audience initially think the villain's plan is to steal the gold from Fort Knox. Bond even points out the madness of this idea by calculating how many trucks would be needed to haul it away.\n\nNot so fast, Goldfinger replies. The actual plan is to detonate a dirty bomb inside the vault, irradiating the gold. In Goldfinger's mind, this will essentially destroy its usefulness for many years, and his own legally-owned gold will increase in value because it's now a scarcer resource, making him an immense profit. Bond later tells Pussy Galore that the plan is insane.\n\nWhat would actually happen if a dirty bomb went off inside the Fort Knox gold depository? Would owners of non-radioactive gold make out like bandits? If the U.S. suddenly had some urgent need to trade away highly radioactive gold, could it just sell bullion inside lead boxes?","answer":"So I'm not an economist, but I am a chemist. A dirty bomb works by scattering radioactive dust in the area of the explosion, so there's little bits of radioactive uranium causing the health hazard. It's possible to remove the dust, so after a thorough clean the gold would be fine. If the uranium caused some of the outermost layer of gold to become radioactive, it would form an isotope of gold, which would then undergo decay into regular gold and helium in a pretty short amount of time, seconds to days depending on the particular isotope formed."}

Come up with fake businesses, or pretend you're writing a business plan for an already existing business in your area.\n\nOnce you've learned how to do that, take the skills you learned writing a business plan, and apply it to your personal life.\n\nWhat are your values, your mission, goals.. how are you going to achieve those goals? What obstacles might you run into? How are you going to overcome those obstacles? What is the timeline for achieving each goal?

{"question":"Isn’t the stock market mostly an indicator of how well corporations are doing? If they are doing well than why is the stock market falling at unprecedented rates?","answer":"Markets are forward looking. Investors and speculators see that things will be worse in the future. That affects corporate profits now.\n\nRemember that companies borrow a lot. They also often borrow at variable interest rates. As a result, their borrowing cost will rise significantly. Bank borrow and lend. In the US however, they usually lend at fixed interest rates for home loans. So, the mortgage payments banks are getting are falling in value due to inflation, but banks can't compensate by increasing interest rates.\n\nThen there's leverage. Many investors use leverage to obtain higher returns. Those loans are also variable rate. They have become sharply more expensive because of the Fed interest rate rises.\n\nLastly, there's bonds which are an alternative to shares. The rate rises have made bonds much more attractive. 15 year US government bonds yield nearly 4%. Compare that to the shares of a company that gives no growth, those may also yield 4%. So, why buy a share - which comes with risk - when you can buy the bond?"}
{"question":"The new car is on avg. $40,000, and the homes people buy are usually way above their pay grade.

Is everyone just in massive debt? Is this sustainable or will it cause another crash?","answer":"I think a lot of it is not just financing (cars and houses bought on credit incuring interest) but just the way that monthly payments are the norm. I feel like I live in a bubble from reading a lot of financial planning subreddits and blogs, so I'm always surprised to see furniture and cell phones bought on a monthly payment (whether financed or not). Best example I have is my partner went to buy an apple watch and asked the price and it was like \"$30\". She said no, like the price to buy it, not to pay monthly. The employee had to go look it up. I was blown away. Is it really that rare that you buy something at cost anymore?  I get it, if it's not financed what's the problem?  For me, the problem is shitty cash flow every month because you're tied up in monthly costs. And if your income changes, you're not done with those transactions, you owe on them for years (usually). I'll never go back to that.\n\nTLDR:  I feel like everyone is tricked into believing they can afford it if it's broken into cost per month."}

{"question":"Would a group of new grads who just graduated from college with Bachelor's degrees in Economics do a fairly good job at running the Federal Reserve, or would they most likely lead the country to economic ruin given the amount of knowledge that their degree has taught them?\n\nLet's say this is their first job and they are tasked with running the Federal Reserve and creating U.S. federal economic policy. \n\nI'm curious as to what necessary on-the-job training in economics you all felt like you acquired that you did not learn in school that would be necessary in government positions like this.","answer":"The Fed is supported by about 300 PhD economists. A PhD in economics is typically an additional five years of training beyond undergrad. Within the Fed, there are a bunch of more senior positions that are pretty much strictly for established economists (so at least ten years post PhD). A position as an economist at the Fed usually requires the accumulation of at least 15 years of bachelors training. Beyond that, the Fed employees a number of lawyers who ensure that the actions the Fed takes are legal and a number of bankers who I honestly don't know what they do, but presumably it's important. So it's not just the economics that the Fed requires, but all the legal and institutional knowledge as well.\n\nA lot of the difference is that a PhD is substantially more thorough and rigorous than an undergraduate degree. As for on the job training, maybe someone who is a mid career PhD economist can chime in.\n\nSo yes, it would be very bad for the economy if the Fed was run by people straight out of undergrad,"}

Its important to be familiar with the subject, you will know when to apply salt accordingly. The NYT opinion section has Krugman and WP has wonks like Drezner. Both sections also have a ton of filler shit articles as well.\n\nEconomist: Probably more geopolitics than Economics ironically, but magazines-due to having to cover a wider period- often have longer articles and tend to be better researched. They often do reviews or talk about topics du jour that you can explore further: piketty appeared a bunch when Capital came out. \n\nPolicy Wonk sites: If you are familiar with the subject, you'll be able to detect someone's bias by their argument\/ who they cite. Some sites are more casual opinion, warontherocks and warisboring for Nat Sec. Others are focused on Industry news, such as Defense one. Use salt accordingly. I'm not as familiar with which ones are the economics equivalent. Try googling scholars you respect, they'll often post to these sites as well.\n\nThe actual source: If you are interested in legislation or enacted policy, bills are available online and the Federal Register is the official mouthpiece of all government organizations policy-wise. The Fed also has a ton of cool graphs\/info.\n\nFinally, the daily news cycle is oppressive in how much comes out a day. Rarely does one require minute-by-minute knowledge, since 24 news channels are just trying to fill up time on slow days. No one wants to watch \"boring day in NYC\". Clicks tend to be garnered from disasters that don't affect them, like miners trapped in cave in or \"disaster occurs in area we would never cover on a busy day\".

After doing so, think what to do the rest money.\n* **Family**. You said you want to adopt a child. This is so amazing but you need to do your budjet estimation because a kid has a lot of expenses. might be a good idea to put some cash at the side for this goal if it is a short-term goal.\n* **Plan ahead**. Then, if you don’t have short term projects (e.g. buying a car, spending big on something, etc) that require cash, you can think about investing into stocks, ETFs etc. I understand that you have 25k saved already and **plan** to save in the next 5 years.\n* **Define an investing goal.** Depending on your goal and time horizon you can decide where to invest. What if you goal? To increase your capital in order to buy your home? VWCE is great for long term but if you seek short term gains then other assets or ETFs can be more appropriate.\n* **ETF choice**. Concerning ETFs, VWCE is a nice, not so risky ETF that contains stocks and many people including myself invest in it. And remember, always invest money that you don’t need in the short term. Also, justetf.com is great for ETF research.\n* **Broker**. As a broker, Degiro and IBKR are the most popular in Europe. I use degiro because of its low fees in nice ETFs like VWCE, IWDA, VUAA. Edit: people say below that in Germany there are also others. Do your research and find a low fee broker.\n* **Optimize taxes**. Concerning capital gain taxes I have no idea so speak with a financial advisor in Germany. Maybe an accumulating ETF is advantageous in your case. Or maybe not."}

{"question":"Doesn't dedicating resources to building new houses when we already have many vacant houses a bad allocation of our land, labor and capital -- not to mention unnecessarily bad for the environment?","answer":"Because the general idea is that where demand is is not the same place that supply is. There is a lot of demand for housing in urban areas, hence they tend to be significantly expensive.  But it’s the opposite effect in rural areas where there is low demand. So, by building more housing in urban areas we can shift the demand supply left so the end result is cheaper housing."}
{"question":"\nHear me out. The airline industry has asked for $50bn in support to avoid bankrupty. Meanwhile these same companies have spend 80-98% of their free cash buying back their own company stock over the last 10 years. American Airlines alone has spent $12.5bn to buy back stocks. This of course is done to reduce overall divident costs and increase the share price. \n\nOn top of that, under the new US corporate tax code all of these companies have lowered their tax bills by billions of dollars. The idea of the tax bill was that this money would be used for investment in technology\/R&amp;D and go to employees. Again a lot of this money ended up being used to buy back stocks. \n\nIndividuals are expected to save up 3-6 months of emergency funds but yet these giant corporations can’t whether any storm.

{"question":"This question is inspired by Adam Something's video [City Review - Prague: Beautiful and Disappointing](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EnVvlhhqWtw)\n\nIn it, he repeats the common argument that a city centre became unaffordable to live in because people who intend to rent them out for Airbnb snap up all the properties and rent them out to tourists. But does that mean that tourism is the real driver of the unaffordability problem?\n\nIf so, why does Airbnb get the blame, and not other tourist infrastructure like hotels? Just like Airbnb, if land in a city centre is purchased to build a hotel on, it would increase demand for land and therefore increase prices.","answer":"Hotels are more controlled than Airbnb. Depending on the city, you either need to buy land zoned for that purpose, or obtain specific permission to build a hotel, or both. Tourism will still compete with residential for land use, but it can’t compete freely, so cities have more tools manage the trade-off between tourism jobs and increased rents.\n\nAirbnb, by contrast, allows landlords to freely convert residential property into tourism accommodation (at least initially, some places have legislated to stop this), so they can arbitrage between tourism &amp; residential, which would cause a convergence in prices.\n\nThis does seem to be supported by empirical evidence - a number of studies have shown a link between volume of airbnb listings &amp; rising rents in particular neighbourhoods.\n\nhttps:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676909"}

As I ask my attorney to draft up the notices I’m feeling guilt for the first time in my real estate investing journey.\n\nI’ve done BRRRRs for multi families but they are typically been either empty or with delinquent tenants. \n\nThoughts?","answer":"Probably wont be popular here but if you're feeling guilt maybe that's for a reason. You have people living in units that need \"severe rehabs\". They probably also recognize this and would've moved if they could afford to, so you will be kicking people out who likely have limited options. As others have said at least give more than 30 days notice.  I realize that you're making an investment but you should also ask yourself what you're even doing this for.  What is the point of a major reno vs. something more minor with a modest rent increase on current tenants? A comment on another thread in this sub recently called this strategy \"reprehensible\" and honestly I agree.  Housing is not a \"pure\" investment.  Obviously you expect to make money and that's fine, but real estate is different than other forms of investing.  It's not just an investment it's someone's home you are providing and if you don't want to deal with the realities of that maybe the money would be put to better use in the stock market."}

{"question":"I'm a newbie to value investing and have been binging on Roaring Kitty's Youtube videos for the past couple of weeks.

Say even if he's ballparking , what is that based on? I'm sure it can't be a simple straight forward formula where you plug in the numbers and outputs the value. If he says a particular company at this current price will be a 4-5 bagger, or sometimes he says \"I'd prefer this stock under 10$\"  how does he determine the value ?\n\n(p.s I'm a beginner so any article or books or tips y'all think would help me out in this learning process would be appreciated )","answer":"What you're looking for is a ***relative baseline***.\n\nEverything in investing (much like life) is relative. What is it relative to? Everything else, of course.\n\nIs company A a better bargain than company B? Is company A less risk to my principal than company B?\n\nHoward Marks is fantastic for this (read his Oaktree memos).\n\nMost people use 10yr US Treasuries as a faux \"absolute baseline\", ie: the safest thing I can buy, often called \"riskless\". The 10 yr Treasury rate is currently about 1.6%.\n\nTo figure out from a P\/E perspective, we just flip the equation to E\/P, to get an earnings yield, which can be compared to a bond yield like a US Treasury. A P\/E of 10 is easy, 1\/10 = 10% yield.\n\nTypically, people apply a couple hundred basis points (fancy word for 1\/100th percent) to account for the risk between a stock and a bond, but of course it depends an awful lot on which stock or which bond.\n\nFor the riskless rate, let's apply 3.5% premium (350 basis points) to compare a treasury to a company we think is very safe). 1.6% 10yr Treasury + 3.5% premium gives us 5.1%. So the hurdle (rate which we must beat) for the stock to be a better deal than the treasury is a 5.1% yield. What is this in P\/E? Just invert. 100\/5.1 = P\/E 19.6\n\nNow you can decide things like \"Do I think interest rates (and treasury yields) will go up the next year or two? Maybe I want to give myself more room to account for this.

There's also a lot of investors looking to gobble up prime real estate either to flip or keep as long term investment.\n\nLots of the frenzy is built  on a combination of factors mostly due to the low interest rate environment, pent up demand from year of COvID ,more workplaces offering more flexible wfh arrangements and increase in millennials ready to settle down. ..\n\nNo one knows if this is a bubble, because it's very different than 2008  , some regions could be in bubble territory depending on what happens when the moratoriums end, others could just be the new normal."}
{"question":"I've heard from a lot of people that say day trading is a very risky career choice because most day traders lose money and it's not worth it. Why is this so, why do most day traders lose money and if \"most\" lose money then there are those \"some\" that are doing well. So what do those day traders do so well that they've capable of having successful day trading careers as opposed to the \"most\" day traders that fail?","answer":"Risk management is the main differentiating factor. Due to human nature\/psychology and whatever you wanna call it, most just simply aren’t able to do it. Someone can 99 good trades with solid consistent profits, get greedy on the 100th one thinking they can 10x their money in a jiffy, and lose everything they had made in those first 99 trades in that one 100th trade. This sort of thing happens all the time and it can happen to anyone, no matter how well disciplined they think they are.\n\nThose who end up surviving are those who literally manage to ‘survive’ without losing their entire account for long enough (at least a couple of years at the earliest, if not more) while they navigate the learning curve and hopefully come out ahead. But it’s rare and most will either lose a substantial amount of money and give up and\/or decide that they would’ve actually made so much profit had they just bought and hold some good stocks and\/or index funds during all that time, and just go back to doing that (which is ultimately the safest most reliable way for anyone to make money in the market, buy index funds and\/or some solid blue chip stocks, keep contributing cash to the account as possible, and forget about the account for a few years).\n\nRight now, there’s tons of traders in the market who started trading after the March crash. Things have gone up since then in the most historic bull run in the market’s history. Someone essentially could’ve closed their eyes and pull some ticker names out of a hat and most likely they would’ve made money on them in the last few months. So there are traders out there who feel they’ve figured out the game and it’ll be smooth sailing from here. We see this type of posts all the time, like ‘check out my $500 to $5000 in last 3 months’ type of stuff. One semi-major speed bump in the market (which are inevitable from time to time) and most of these traders will be wiped out, and the cycle will begin again.\n\nThose who have been around longer always take the market with a healthy dose of skepticism and try to have their ducks in a row as much as possible, but that doesn’t mean they also aren’t susceptible to being wiped out if the perfect storm comes around.\n\nGood luck to all!"}

Human transportation (air taxi) drones, and industrial inspection and maintenance are examples of adjacent industries that have great growth potential and not a lot of competition.

Any accidental violation of this term will be tantamount to fraud, and the lender may initiate legal proceedings against you.\n\nIt's unclear if they will actually enforce this, but it does seem risky to take a loan knowing that even accidental deletion will be considered fraud.

{"question":"From my own research, it seems like accounting, IT related, some trade, and vocational nurse degrees are the best bet. What do y'all think? I'm trying to make some real progress in pay without taking on debt.","answer":"Please do not listen to reddit on this kind of thing. People here ***wildly*** overestimate\/overvalue any sort skilled or semi-skilled trade pay. I think people on reddit have a fetish with \"manly\" careers, or at least are blissfully unaware of little most of them pay.\n\nFor example, the most highly rated comment in this thread claims you can make $100k driving a truck. The ***median pay*** for truck drivers is ***41k a year***, and the top 10% make ***$63k***. I'm sure someone makes $100k driving a truck, but its gotta be the top 0.1%.\n\nInevitably, when someone points out the data to debunk these wildly inflated salaries people on reddit throw out for trade skills, we get a lot of people commenting about how they know person X who is in a trade and makes a ton of money. That is called an ***argument by exception***. Medians and percentile rankings represent a large number of people. You can still know someone who makes $100k in a trade while the median is $40k. It is sort of like arguing that because Bill Gates dropped out of college and made billions, it is a good idea to drop out of college. \n\n***Edit 1:*** I am getting a lot of people responding to me trying to qualify their claims by saying that you have to move to make these huge dollar figures. The numbers I am looking at cover the entire United States, your local market may pay $60k+ for truck driving but that just means your market is on the right side of the income distribution. \n\n***Edit 2:*** I am also seeing a lot of people replying and claiming that these $100k figures are real, but only if you drive your own truck and work for yourself. The great thing is the BLS also has data on self-employed individuals in this profession.  Self employed individuals in the following occupations do ***not*** make much more than traditional employees: Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Drivers, Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers, and Industrial Truck and Tractor Operators.

There were varying degrees of legal market activity, such as collective farms being able to sell food they produced above their quotas. And we do know there can be differences between the official accounts and the day-to-day reality, for example while state-owned enterprises in the Soviet Union were officially centrally planned, they'd employ buyers to trade with other such enterprises to get their needed inputs.

That means if you bought in the morning, you would do just as well as if you bought at close, as long as you're not selling your whole portfolio EVERY NIGHT and re-buying it every morning. In other words, someone who buys in the morning and holds gets to enjoy the overnight growth just as much as someone who bought right before close.

In years past this was previously regarded as being appropriate by some economic thinkers like Marx, but is not widely believed by modern economists today.\n\nAn alternate method of calculation might be to take the [federal minimum wage for 1968](https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/agencies\/whd\/minimum-wage\/history\/chart) ($1.60) and adjust purely for inflation using something like the [Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/data\/inflation_calculator.htm), which would indicate that it should be about $12.27.  In this sense, the Politifact checker cited is pretty much on track.\n\nThis gets problematic though, since it doesn't take into account whether $12.27 would really be sufficient to provide a comparable relative standard of living in the current era, when things like housing, cars, and healthcare are much more expensive if for no other reason than they're much safer and more advanced now. Something like broadband internet access would have been a fantastically unimaginable luxury in 1968, but now is often considered essential or nearly so. In this sense, just pegging wages to any one metric might not be answering the wider social questions well enough.\n\nAnother popular method of selecting minimum wage target is 150% of the [federal poverty level](https:\/\/aspe.hhs.gov\/poverty-guidelines) for a family of 4; the idea being that any person working full-time ought to be able to provide such a standard of living to her\/his family at a minimum. In 2021 for the lower 48 this would amount to $39,750\/yr, or about $19.40\/hr assuming 51 weeks\/yr and 40 hrs\/week.

{"question":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DanPriceSeattle\/status\/1309696726425628672\n\nRestaurant industry profit margins are very low, so it seems to me that any franchise paying this much would be bankrupt instantly.","answer":"So [this Bloomberg article](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/features\/2015-mcdonalds-franchises\/) has a [table](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZoLFd0w.jpg) that breaks down the finances for McDonald's franchises in the US (credit to \/u\/uptons_bjs for finding it). Based on this table, we can try and estimate the price\/quantity change needed to support higher wages in the US. Specifically, let's see what needs to happen in order to keep the profit quantity constant. \n\n\n**Case 1: Growing Sales**\n\nSuppose that McDonalds was able to grow net sales by keeping prices constant. Furthermore, suppose that the composition of new sales was such that the composition of increased expenses did not change. In other words, assume that sales growing by 10% caused all other expenses to grow by the same amount. We don't have enough data to figure out what to assume otherwise, hence this is the simplest assumption. But, this will *overestimate* the quantity growth required to raise profit. \n\n[This table](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CiXSUJ5.png) shows the necessary growth in sales in order to compensate for a 100% increase in payroll expenses. Basically, if net sales and the cost of goods go up by 77.5% along with other expenses, we can hit about the same level of total operating income as before. \n\n\n**Case 2: Raising Prices**\n\nThis time, suppose McDonalds just raised prices. We will also assume complete inelasticity of demand (very wrong assumption!). We don't have enough data to figure out the true elasticity, so this is a generous assumption. Then, a Y% increase in prices will increase net sales by Y%, since we're assuming quantity sold doesn't change. At the same time, we can assume that all other costs and expenses are constant, since quantity sold is constant. \n\n\nHere's [the table](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mbPC28O.png) but it now also shows how much of a price increase we need to compensate for a 100% increase in payroll expenses. As you can see, it's 37.5% which is a lot less than the quantity increase needed. \n\n\n**Case 3: Both**\n\nThere's multiple possible solutions here. Note that a 10% sales growth and 10% price growth will raise net sales by 1.1^2 = 1.21. So, the math is a little bit different from before. However, we are again assuming inelastic prices and that quantity growth causes an equivalent percentage change in each row. \n\nThe last part of [this table](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9iF9yR1.png) shows that 15% price growth and 12% sales growth is enough to ensure profit stays the same. \n\n----\n\nSo, basically, with  a moderate increase in price and sales, US franchises could face double the payroll expenses without losing much operating income. \n\nBut, take this all with a big grain of salt, because I've made some major simplifying assumptions to do the math here."}

{"question":"I'm not involved in real estate much, but I can't help but think that heavily over-paying on a property (which, granted, is a long-term investment) seems a bit crazy on the surface to me.\n\nMany are paying cash, waiving appraisals\/inspections etc just to get to the top of a list for property listed 48 hours ago. I'm in the US, and I'm a bit familiar with how much foreign investors are at play.\n\nIs this just a potential recipe for another major bust, or is there more to this story than I understand?","answer":"I wouldn't speak to much to the macro effects but I work in real estate so I'll lay out a few concepts. Sorry I'm on mobile. \n\nThe prices are high right now for at least three reasons. The lowering of interest rates means people can spend more and keep the same monthly payment they would have 2 years ago. Sellers have seen this and began raising prices last year as more people were shopping for homes then previously.\n\nBuilding materials have gone up in cost across the nation. From my understanding this is partly due to the forest fires in California, and partly due to covid restrictions on staffing at lumber mills. I believe tariffs have also had an effect. This has led to showing production. I've known a few builders that have just stopped production entirely last year.\n\nMore jobs going online and work from home have given people the freedom to live further away from their work and to live where they've wanted to move. This includes people from HCOL areas moving to cheaper markets and beyond and to offer cash on top of what a bank would be able to loan on a property. \n\nThis has all compounded to a lack of supply on a national scale. Some states have been hit worse then others.\n\nOur system of typical home loans requiring appraisals has at least slowed down the raise in pricing, but hasn't stopped the people with extra resources from offering over the appraised value. Appraiser's can only use comparable past sales to bracket appraised value with similar homes. As more homes are sold for inflated values, this become less of a hindrance on the values appraisers can reach.\n\nCommon perception in my corner of the real estate corner is that values will lower as interest rates raise. The speed for both would depend on the federal reserve. Im personally not sure how much they'll lower, since production is in no way close to making up for the lack of supply. Even when production rates were at full capacity two years ago, some markets still had signs of lack of supply, so I'm not sure how they would catch up. \n\nHow many jobs will continue to support remote workers? When will building material production raise enough to lower supply cost? Will we struggle with finding labor for the needed housing supply? Will interest rates raise too sharply force home values to crash? Stay tuned for the next episode"}

{"question":"I am loving our growth this year, and if bitcoin can get to where it is as an unusable coin, there is no reason Ethereum (which is superior in every way) can't","answer":"You're not wrong, but I think a direct correlation to Bitcoin is unwise. Not even considering total supply, remember that Bitcoin has years in development.

That being said I have 0 btc, and hold around 70% of my stake in eth. It is far superior and could definitely take over btc as the face of crypto but it'll take some time.

{"question":"Thinking about human nature, I feel it is reasonable to assume some companies will take the news about inflation and use it to raise prices higher than actually needed, but blame inflation.

Unfortunately, [local land-use regulations](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dataisbeautiful\/comments\/g4bdb0\/comment\/fnwed99\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) are driving up production costs and\/or preventing the construction of more affordable units.

Over time, the housing units we built have become nicer—larger square footage, more features (like A\/C), etc. We could see an increase in more basic homes that cost a little less. However, as long as land-use regulations remain prevalent, the effect on the price of housing is likely to be limited.\n\nBut more broadly, we could see faster growth in the cities that have more relaxed regulations that allow the housing supply to expand.

{"question":"Here I am not thinking about developers but landlords who buy property to rent out. Considering that they did not design, build, plumb, or contribute in any other way to the development of the housing, are these people not extracting wealth without creating any?","answer":"Separating property managers from landlords because I think it's pretty clear what value a property manager brings -- somebody has to fix the pipes, repair the AC, make sure the building passes fire inspection etc. These are all things that I as a tenant am paying money specifically so I do not have to think about them and were I a homeowner I would have to bother with them.\n\nThere are also obvious reasons why renting is good for an economy; taking myself as an example, I'm at a stage in my life where I'm moving a lot and if I couldn't rent I would be forced to buy and sell a house every time I wanted to move, which is obviously suboptimal for a lot of reasons.\n\nBut tackling the question of \"why private landlords\", the usual normative justification is that someone has to take on the risk of owning property. As a renter, if there's some property damage -- let's say a fire -- I can just move, but the landlord faces a much larger monetary loss. The landlord would likely be insured for that, but they wouldn't be insured for the pipes bursting or the AC failing, etc. So clearly there's risk in operating a rental unit and people need to be compensated for that risk in order for them to take the risk. And taking on this risk creates value. I've no interest in defending the many shitty landlords, but that's the general argument. \n\nBut why private landlords as opposed to the government? Basically the same justification for why use markets and not to centrally plan things; it's really hard for a government to figure out where to build housing, how much to charge for it, etc (not withstanding that transitioning from private to public ownership is challenging). There are successful housing regimes with substantial government involvement ([the city of Vienna owns and operates about 25% of Vienna's housing stock](https:\/\/www.huduser.gov\/portal\/pdredge\/pdr_edge_featd_article_011314.html), and this has had generally good outcomes for Austrian citizens), but there's a big jump from 25% to 100% of housing been owned and planned by the government."}
{"question":"I may be wrong about this, but why does it seem like there is a conflict of interest between what's best for individual finance vs the economy? For example, it's best for a person to live frugally and use the most money to invest (education, health, retirement, etc.); whereas, it's better for the economy if everybody spends all of their money on not just essential but also luxurious goods. A society where people save more than they spend is a deflationary one. Likewise, a society where people invest more than they spend would probably cause a market bubble since more people buying a company's stock than it's product just drives its PE ratio through the roof\n\nAnother example is having kids is expensive. It's best for a poor couple to not have kids or only one if they want to get out of poverty as fast as possible. However, in economics, every couple should have 2 kids to sustain the future workforce and consumer spending.","answer":"The general idea that individual household prudence can be bad for the economy is absolutely correct - this is called the Paradox of Thrift, and while it was heavily popularised by Keynes (1936), it's been part of mainstream economics for a long time. Keynes himself notes that Adam Smith (1776) refers to it in The Wealth of Nations, saying \"*What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great Kingdom*\", and John M. Robertson (1892) wrote a whole book called the Fallacy of Saving, saying \"*Had the whole population been alike bent on saving, the total saved would positively have been much less... industrial paralysis would have been reached sooner or oftener, profits would be less, interest much lower, and earnings smaller and more precarious. This ... is no idle paradox, but the strictest economic truth*.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe formalised version is essentially a prisoner's dilemma. There is some intertemporal balance of savings and consumption in each period which is optimal for the economy, and another one which is optimal for the individual. There is no requirement that the two are the same. Some economists bicker over how different they are, for example there are those who argue that savings represent investments and are also conducive to growth; which is not wrong, but from an intertemporal optimisation point of view, investment returns come with significant lag, so they are not optimal in each period. Consequently, no one really disputes that it would take a dramatic coincidence for the individual and collective optimums to be exactly the same even in one period for one individual, let alone in every period for every individual. This is made even worse in a recession, where greater economic uncertainty motivates higher precautionary savings, but higher savings would sink the economy into a larger hole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the specific examples you choose to highlight though... some are more relevant than others. Overvaluation of the stock market isn't necessarily related to overinvestment, but rather inefficient allocation of investments. If the total value of investments increases dramatically, but the threshold for required returns remains the same, then there's really no change in valuations; instead, capital flows to underinvested companies, or to new opportunities. If there are no new opportunities but investment inflow continues to enter the market, that's not a problem in itself either, all it does is lower the expected market return and hence valuations continue to remain fair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are actually a bunch more economic paradoxes; most kicking in when the economy is in a recession or otherwise impaired. The paradox of toil argues that an increase in willingness to work can have the effect of lowering wages, but if nominal interest rates are at a zero lower bound then total demand falls instead since people have lower spending power and no further available credit, workers just spend less and the economy shrinks. The paradox of flexibility argues a similar angle, but points to low wage stickiness (perhaps from having good-natured and understanding workers) making it easier for wages to fall, also causing the economy to shrink. The paradox of deleveraging focuses on banks, who when faced with economic recession, tend to reduce the risk on their balance sheet; but in so doing, tighten credit and magnify distress to the economy."}

Dont we need taco bell workers, janitors, etc.? If everyone had a college degree or more, who would be \/ who would wanna work in these jobs?","answer":"In the short run there could be a shortage of low skilled workers, but then wages rise to compensate for the low supply. \n\nMore people in higher skilled work may decide they would prefer to work in a lower skilled profession if it means they could earn the same amount or slightly lower without the stress that can come with a more demanding profession. \n\nAdditionally less people may be inclined to take up further education pursuing a more skilled profession if low skilled work wages rise. Same goes for those already in low skilled professions (leaving low skilled work in pursuit of higher skilled work) \n\nThere’ll also be higher immigration into countries that see a rise in wages for low skilled work where their home countries have lower wages, improving the trade off of moving abroad for work to send funds back home."}

Algorithms are constantly learning herd behavior so they can trade ahead of it.\n\n&gt; Investment funds exist to aggregate user money to make bets on the collective results of the world's traders, who are now mostly lines of code coded by mathematicians and statisticians. They trade on inside information and they all front-run the herd with misleading information or selective omission. As the investing public, we've all agreed that it's ok for them to cheat because they are cheating on our behalf in the form of investment savings, and pensions. We just ride the whale. For non-institutional traders like myself, we don't trade with a particular ideology. We just follow the whale. \n\n&gt; The funds are not 'smart' money as the media often claim.

I don’t get it. Do people earning less than 100k per year even have a goddamn voice in this country?","answer":"Part of the reason for all the negativity is the wealth effect being hit when house prices drop. People who may have no intention or interest in selling love to hear their house appreciated by $100K or so. Some may use that to refinance, draw down on equity to pay for an IP or buy a new car, or go on an overseas trip.\n\nSo when they hear their house has dropped in value by $100K, they feel poorer. Now, to go on that trip to Bali or Bermuda, they may not have enough equity to draw down. So they either have to save (many may not be doing that actively so it feels hard), or they have to pull back on their expectations- the new Porsche Cayenne will have to wait, so the old Pajero will have to keep going for a few more years.\n\nSo even though people may not be looking to sell, their lives are impacted because their options for increased consumption have been pared back.\n\nBesides, we have a culture where home ownership is worshipped and some of the media networks have ownership in the real estate portals."}

What am I missing?","answer":"Here's the math. \n\nThe term cap rate refers to the net operating income divided by the price of the property. \n\nNet operating income ignores any mortgage, as that cost can fluctuate greatly based on how big of a loan is taken out. The cap rate is essentially the return you would achieve if you bought the property outright without a mortgage. I'll explain why you wouldnt do that. \n\nIn today's market where values are high cap rates are lower, but typically still higher than the cost of a mortgage.\n\nLet's use 8% cap rate (return) for example as that's around where I bought my last property.\n\n Let's see how leverage enhances those returns with a fictional example of a 100K property where we put 20K down and borrow 80K @ a 4% interest rate. \n\nA 100k property with an 8% cap rate will return 8k in NOI annually, and the interest on the loan will cost $3,200, for a net income of $4,800\n\nA $4,800 net income on a 20k investment is a 24% leveraged return in your first year. If rent income increases or property value increases, so does you return. \n\nAnd that's how leverage takes an investment which produces an 8% return and turns it into a 24% return. \n\nUS Real Estste allows you to apply a lot of leverage in a way that's not overly risky (dont get me wrong, more leverage always means more risk).\n\nDid I succeed in ELI5?

I’ve seen that it causes landlords to not care about upkeep, it causes abandoned buildings occasionally cause they weren’t profitable, and I read it can lead to construction of more luxury buildings where rent control doesn’t apply. In that last case it seems like this system that tries to help the poor in fact helps the rich. Yet I still see politicians advocating for it and it still exists in places around the world.

Particularly, if you're a resident in a rent-controlled apartment, the policy may benefit you even if it's at the expense of many others. So it's entirely possible that the beneficiaries (who are current residents) may be a powerful voting group."}

However, their impact on overall economic growth is more ambiguous. One [study](https:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/mcb\/006\/1995\/00000022\/00000003\/art00002) looked at public enterprises in the OECD, finding that \"the evidence fails to support the hypothesis of a negative relationship between [public enterprises] and economic growth.\"\n\nSimilarly, a more recent [study](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1898677) looked at SOEs in China, and found that while they are less profitable, they also generate positive spillover effects that benefit the overall economy. To quote:\n\n&gt; Since these two effects offset each other, the contribution of SOEs to economic growth in China during our sample time frame was not significantly different from that of non-state enterprises.\n\nThere is also some evidence that SOEs can [improve health](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0020731419833530) and [reduce inequality](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1062940818303681), while privatization is associated with [lower wages](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3278753#:~:text=Following%20privatization%2C%20wages%20for%20incumbent,to%20within-establishment%20wage%20changes.)

{"question":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supply_and_demand#Criticism\n\nBasically, there's two arguments here:\n\n1. Supply and demand is a tautology, or the existence of it is unfalsifiable. The labor theory of value is a better way to set prices.\n2. Supply and demand doesn't apply to modern goods, since stores set prices using a fixed markup percentage over their costs. \n\nI thought supply and demand was a cornerstone of economics, like Newton's laws are to physics, but I'm just a layperson. \n\nAre these criticisms supported by a lot of economists? Is supply and demand really in doubt? Or are these just fringe positions that aren't backed up by research?","answer":"&gt;Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?\n\nNo. But we can expand on that a bit.\n\nSupply and demand is a model. Models are approximations of reality. Whether a model is a good approximation of realty in any specific application depends on how well the particular market you're studying lines up with the assumptions of the model. For example, S&amp;D assumes that (a) everyone knows what they're buying, (b) every firm in the market is selling basically the same good, and (c) there are many buyers and sellers, so that no one customer or firm has outsized influence on the good's price. Some markets satisfy those conditions; others do not.\n\nSupply and demand is a general framework that can be used to study a wide variety of market phenomena. However, if you are studying a specific market at a specific time in a specific place, then you might want to use a more detailed model that better conforms to the application under investigation.\n\nThere is an entire field of economics, *industrial organization,* that studies the behavior of supply in situations where the assumptions of supply and demand are not a good approximation for reality. This includes situations in which there are few competitors (monopoly, oligopoly); situations in which competitors compete on brand (monopolistic competition), situations in which one firm's actions depend on the actions of others (game theory), etc. All of these models allow for a more detailed analysis than simple S&amp;D. \n\nUsually S&amp;D should be the first place you go to solve your problem, but not necessarily the last place. You can use S&amp;D to get coarse answers to most questions, and more detailed models to get richer answers. \n\n-----\n\nRegarding the two criticisms you mentioned:\n\n1. S&amp;D is not a tautology; classical consumer and producer theory produces implications that can be tested against data. However, S&amp;D *is* a very general framework (by design), so it can accommodate a rather wide range of behavior.\n\n2. Under supply and demand, firms set price equal to marginal cost. There is no markup, and no profit. This is an extreme prediction. In most richer industrial organization models, firms set price equal to a markup over marginal cost. The size of the markup is a key object of interest in IO, and usually can be linked to demand parameters or other such primitives. But it's not necessarily \"fixed.\" Furthermore, in many IO models, the size of the markup falls as the number of competitors grows large -- so S&amp;D is the \"limit\" as the number of competitors grows.\n\n  You can even use these richer models to put bounds on how good the S&amp;D approximation is; for example, some models allow claims such as \"for any industry with more than 10 competitors, the S&amp;D-predicted price will be within 10% of the more complicated model's predicted price.\" Such bounds can be helpful, and put S&amp;D in its proper context. I wouldn't say these results \"invalidate\" S&amp;D, they just provide a richer model of the price-setting environment.\n\nSo, again, S&amp;D is usually a good first stab at most problems at a high level, and the answers one obtains can be refined by using more advanced models. There are famous cases where the S&amp;D answer and the more complicated model's answer are totally different (such as the case of price controls), but those are famous in part because they're rare.\n\nThink of models less in terms of, \"is the model right or wrong,\" and more, \"is it more or less useful in this particular situation?\" or, \"is it more or less useful in giving reasonable answers in a broad range of situations?\""}

How would that process work?\n\nI thank you in advance and am not looking for political answers but distinctly economic ones.","answer":"We'll take your Jeff Bezos example. The majority of Bezos's fortune is held in Amazon stock. If Bezos wanted to turn his stock into cash, he would simply sell his Amazon stock. However, because he owns such a large amount of Amazon stock, if he decided to dump all of it at once, it would hurt Amazon's share price and lower his net worth in the process. So he'd have to sell it very slowly over time to realise it's full value, assuming the stock price held stable over this time period which is a big assumption. If you taxed his wealth highly enough, then you'd see him have to devalue Amazon stock by selling off enough shares to cover the tax burden."}
{"question":"I'm not involved in real estate much, but I can't help but think that heavily over-paying on a property (which, granted, is a long-term investment) seems a bit crazy on the surface to me.\n\nMany are paying cash, waiving appraisals\/inspections etc just to get to the top of a list for property listed 48 hours ago. I'm in the US, and I'm a bit familiar with how much foreign investors are at play.\n\nIs this just a potential recipe for another major bust, or is there more to this story than I understand?","answer":"So when you say another \"major bust\" I suspect that you might be thinking of another 2008 style crash. It's important to note that there can be a decrease in home values without the broader economic effects that we saw in 2008.\n\nIn 2008 there essentially was a lot of things that in one way or another were relying on the fact that home values could only go up. There were a lot of risky mortgages being given out to people who could only afford them by cashing in on rising home prices. Securitization of these loans along with very poor credit ratings led a lot of the financial industry to be exposed to these loans without realizing the risk involved, and the entire economy is very exposed to the financial industry. Eventually new construction responded to the boom in the housing market, which leveled out prices and then the house of cards described above started to collapse.\n\nContrast that with now. There are many causes and it's hard to pinpoint the exact magnitude but they appear to be different than what we saw then.\n\nFirst is low inventory. While the housing market appears to be booming, there's actually not many people selling their home right now. This is most likely because people don't want to move during a pandemic. \n\nThen there's higher savings rates. While the pandemic hit many people hard economically, many others are able to (and almost forced to) save more now than ever. Many of the things people normally spend on (travel, entertainment, commuting costs) are no longer there. Add some government assistance like stimulus checks as a bonus and many people are racking up savings. This is very different than 2008 where [savings was very low](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20071217193831\/http:\/\/www.bea.gov\/briefrm\/saving.htm) and it was fueled by lending. There's a lot of cash offers being thrown around and no indication that banks are loosening their lending requirements.\n\nAnother factor is the pandemic changing what markets are desirable. Many people can now work from anywhere, and cities have many aspects shut down or limited so people want to move to places further from their office where they can have more space. This leads to excess demand in places that never had this level of demand before.\n\nThe point of all this is to say that there's not much of an indication of systemic risk in any of these explanations we see. This is a short term trend currently, and the low volume means not many people actually paid these prices. Furthermore, people seem to be able to afford these prices and have a sufficient amount of equity in these houses, banks don't seem to be overly exposed. \n\nIf the housing market corrected tomorrow back to 2019 levels, we would likely see a small minority of homeowners underwater (those who bought at the peak 2020 levels) and they would likely take the losses themselves rather than us seeing 2008 levels of foreclosures. For everyone else, they would be in the same place as before the pandemic (with regard to their home value). The trend could also continue as several of the reasons listed above could be lasting changes.\n\nThere could be a systemic risk exposed with a sudden correction in housing prices, but that's not readily apparent in the time being. I know this rambled quite a bit but the main point I was trying to get at is that the housing market can go up and down -- even quite dramatically -- and it doesn't mean there has to be giant rippling effects across the economy."}

Are they making large enough profits for these above inflation pay rises?","answer":"The reason you're not getting any answers is because it's impossible to formulate a general answer that applies to every sector\/company, let alone to every country with its own economic intricacies. \n\nIf you can give an example of a specific company, we could look up its financial reports, but without a clear target this is a very difficult conversation to have without getting overly political."}
{"question":"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/02\/08\/965483266\/-15-minimum-wage-would-reduce-poverty-but-cost-jobs-cbo-says\n\nTo what degree could the loss of jobs be explained by people no longer needing to work 2nd or 3rd jobs? Also, I'm starting to feel like there's no reason an advanced, modernized economy shouldn't consider workers getting paid more to do less a positive indicator, even something to be strived for, in which case less poverty and fewer jobs is perhaps the ideal outcome. Call me a dirty socialist, but what are the flaws in my interpretation here? I feel like my thesis must have lots of holes, but I don't understand economics well enough to spot them.","answer":"It isn't necessarily bad, no. But it depends. I do not think many labor economists would endorse the story you describe, however.\n\nIt's more like this. It turns out, people who take minimum wage jobs tend to have high employment churn rates, meaning they may hold a number of jobs throughout the year, but not holding any job for very long. Think being employees at job A for 3 months, then being unemployed for a month, then having job B for 4 months, then having no job for 2 months, etc.\n\nGiven the above, what happens if unemployment goes up a little bit? Well, rather then a specific set of full time employed workers losing their jobs and staying unemployed throughout the year, a more typical result would be for people going from 9mo employed throughout the year to 8mo (or however many months) employed throughout the year. And in that case, so long as the wage increase is large enough, it can offset the reduction in unemployment for each person such that they come out ahead in terms of annual earnings.\n\nOf course, for a large enough increase in unemployment, this math doesn't come out favorably for workers. And for large unemployment increases, like during the great recession, you do see people become long term unemployed - that's basically the case where you go from working however much to not working at all all year long.\n\nAs for your initial theory, that people may simply be choosing to work less because their incomes are higher. This is a phenomenon to some extent, but it is offset by the phenomenon that people may wish to work more when higher wages are offered. My recollection is that there isn't any good evidence that income effects (the labor econ phrase for the effect of having more money on your willingness to work) are substantially negative in this income range.\n\nAs a final note, I would mention that the cbo report has an idiosyncratically large estimate of the impact of minimum wages on employment that is larger than the largest negative estimates promoted by the minority of labor economists who think that minimum wages increases have a notable negative effect on employment. It's a bit hard to explain how they got to it as well. They seem to have done a mini lit review, gotten to an unusually large estimate, and then multiplied it by one and a half for no particular good reason."}

{"question":"Currently have 3M€ (2.5M in an investment fund doing well {around 13-16% yoy} and 500.000€ cash). Many years ago I bought a stake in a company that is being sold and will net me an additional 7-8M€ after tax. I live a comfortable but not excessive life in Spain and my earnings more than cover my living expenses plus occasionally luxuries\/hobbies. What on earth do I do with the extra?

I'd get their advice (it's usually by the book, good stuff), but I'd avoid paying them annual fees to manage your stuff. If you do wish this, specifically seek out a fiduciary in Spain (or elsewhere you may have a domicile of some sort, some countries like the US where a fiduciary is legally bound to represent your best  interests take it quite seriously).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe important thing is to consider what your goals are.

You can expect about 8% a year, or 800k on 10 million. At your age of 45 and given your earnings and wealth are so much larger than what you need, you can easily manage the volatility of the market without being impacted, and stocks remain the highest returning asset class. You could keep spending 200k (2%) a year and never see the money run out, especially not if you're going to be making that in earnings from your salary. Then decide on donating and writing a will, a little later in the next few years as you get more comfortable and knowledgeable."}

{"question":"I’m trying to grasp if billionaires actually pose a significant impact on the working class. On the consumer side I wouldn’t think they would trigger much inflation outside of stocks since their consumption for food, cars etc. are similar to a working class consumer. Perhaps on the income side they cause a suppression of wages by extracting excess value but wouldn’t competition generally minimize that excess? What am I missing or is there no fundamental problem with billionaires?","answer":"&gt; What am I missing or is there no fundamental problem with billionaires?\n\nFrom an income distribution perspective billionaires are pretty irrelevant representing an extreme outlier that politicians like using as an excuse for tax policy (in both directions). Depending on the level of corruption (NB - corruption doesn't just mean bribes, its policy influence in general) in a country they can be created due to extractive policies but these tend to be fairly obvious.\n\nWhile the $1t in income more than $1m earned each year would certainly be a useful source of revenue to combat deficits and the demographic wall facing us its not enough. For the broad based social welfare systems we have, and want to increase, we need broad based tax increases so we look like the rest of the world (the US has low rates of income tax but currently extremely progressive, they need to be higher rates and less progressive). 63% of filers are between $50k and $500k but tax increases for most of those are out of the question politically.\n\n&gt; On the consumer side I wouldn’t think they would trigger much inflation outside of stocks since their consumption for food, cars etc. are similar to a working class consumer.\n\nInflation occurring because people have excess income which they are spending instead of saving is a good thing, its generally not harmful to other consumers as an increase in demand for goods also increases demand for labor (higher wages). This is also why immigration is a net positive across most income groups.\n\nOne good tax policy for the wealthy is smarter &amp; better estate tax design to avoid large inheritances which would have an outsized effect on intergenerational mobility (if you are concerned with inequality this is primarily where policy should be focused). You want to encourage them to spend as much as they can while alive, tax as much as you can after they die (estate taxes are in a fairly unique part of tax policy of having extremely low distortionary costs if designed correctly) but avoid taxing in a way that causes privately owned businesses to break up.\n\nOn the last point this has been one of the most significant challenges of design to date. If someone dies and they own a private corporation if the estate tax is high enough those inheriting the business would have to sell or dissolve the business to pay estate taxes which is not a desirable outcome. Creating a loophole for private businesses would just mean the wealthy would move their capital in to a private business to avoid the taxes but large privately owned businesses dissolving is extremely disruptive."}

{"question":"I think most people have seen those comparison that if you’re make a certain amount, you’re top percent in the world. \n\nI recently saw that $32,400 per year puts you at top 1% income in the world. \n\nShould we really use these numbers as a basis to justify people who complain about their wages? After all, everything also costs more in the US. For instance, for a family of 3, making $21000 a year is considered poverty but at the same time, take that to some 3rd world country and you’re living in luxury.","answer":"[Anand and Segal (2017)](http:\/\/www.lse.ac.uk\/International-Inequalities\/Assets\/Documents\/Working-Papers\/Working-Paper-8-Who-are-the-Global-Top-1.pdf) find that the threshold to be in the top 1 percent (edit: as of 2012) is $50,600 *per person in a household*, so around $150,000 for a family of three. This puts only 7.7% of the US population in the global top 1%. The figure of $32,400 was based on different data with less coverage of the richest people in the world, and so is probably an underestimate. But that figure was also per person in a household, so $97,200 for a family of 3 would be the threshold.\n\nOn the other hand, 60.7% of Americans are in the top *ten* percent of income according to the same figures. The threshold for that is only $15,300 per person, $46,000 for a family of three. And that is adjusted for cost of living, because it uses [purchasing power parity](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Purchasing_power_parity) exchange rates. The fact is that there are billions of people in the world who are poorer than the median American, or even Americans below the poverty line. \n\nThat doesn't mean it's not justified for Americans to complain about their wages. Poor or middle-class Americans might have more income than most other people in the world, but if they're not earning as much as they could be with different government policy or employer behavior, there's no reason why they shouldn't complain about that."}

What exactly about Capitalism makes it relatively new and different?\n\nThank you,","answer":"&gt; I know this sounds like a stupid question....\n\nNo it doesn't, not at all.\n\n&gt; A quick search leads you to some simple answers like private ownership of goods and properties along with Individual trade and commerce. But hasn't this by and large always been the case in human society? Ancient Romans owned land and goods. You could go up to an apple seller and haggle a price for apples. What exactly about Capitalism makes it relatively new and different?\n\nThis is the problem. The term \"Capitalism\" was created by people who declared themselves to be critics of Capitalism. They also tried to define it as something fairly new. At least something that happened after ~1600. But, as you point out trade and ownership are ancient in origin (as is money). It is remarkably hard to come up with a definition of Capitalism that's really satisfactory.\n\nLet's think about what's necessary to make Capitalism something modern, something that happened after the year 1600. That rules-out lots of things. Trade can't be the defining factor, that's ancient. Money can't be the defining factor either, that's also ancient. The same is true of private property. The inequality of private property is also ancient. In many past societies there was landowners and merchants who owned lots of property, while the common people owned very little.\n\nSome would reach for slavery or serfdom. The idea here is that Capitalism is defined by markets and private property, but also by the *lack* of slavery. This also doesn't really work. Nearly always, in ancient societies there was slavery. Similarly, there was something like serfdom in most Manorial societies (as far as I know). But, sometimes it wasn't commonplace. So, if only a tiny population of slaves exist in a place how can that mean that it's not Capitalist?\n\nAnother criteria that people advocate is wage labour. The idea here is that there's Capitalism if workers are paid wages. Payment through wages is an old idea and the Romans had salaries. Also, places without market economies still had wages, such as the USSR. We can imagine a world much like our own with no wages. Businesses pay people for specific acts of work, not by the hour. Each person is a small business (a sole-trader). In such a world there would still be markets and money. Rich people could still be rich because they could rent out things to others (e.g. property and machinery).\n\nEconomists tend not to use the word Capitalism so much because of the problems of defining it."}

If you bought SCHD at inception (2012) and held during a strong bull market with low rates, your dividend income would have grown at a 15.6% CAGR. This is factoring in DRIP, no taxes, and 0 additional contributions.\n\n$250k invested into SCHD at inception would have paid $33.4k worth of dividends in 2022. If we project out 10 years into the future and simply say that dividend income will keep growing 15% per year, we finish with $135k\/year over a 20 year period. (still pretty good)\n\nBut even if we assume favorable market conditions for the next 20 years, can we really expect that dividend income to keep compounding at 15% per year?

{"question":"I mean that's enough to have 100% control right? \n\nAlso, when it is reported that he offers to buy Twitter, from whom is it? Wouldn't he just buy all the shares? Or are many of them not on the market?","answer":"Control over a company isn't binary, but exists on a spectrum. References to ownership here are by voting power, not economic interest, because lots of companies have dual-class shares. While 51% ownership guarantees a significant amount of control, a much smaller ownership, even under 5% at times, allows disproportionate influence, whereas other decisions need to be passed by a supermajority of 2\/3 or 3\/4 of votes, depending on the company's articles.\n\nHowever, I believe the general facts aren't as pertinent here as the specific history of Elon Musk, who has been at loggerheads with the SEC, the regulator of listed securities in the US. Even if he were to own 90% of the shares, if the remaining 10% were listed on a US stock exchange, he'd be bound by their regulations in a way that he wouldn't if the company were to go private. This would apply to any company going private, but I think it is of disproportionate importance to Musk. \n\nAs for the second part, shares don't get “on the market” unless the owner gives the specific order to the broker to sell. What happens most of the time is that these transactions, for tiny fractions of a company's shareholding, are conveyed to the stock exchange. However, when you want to buy a massive chunk of the shareholding, up to and including all of it, it becomes a lot easier and cheaper (edit: and sometimes necessary; see below) to make a tender offer, wherein you announce the number of shares and price per share you're soliciting (kind of similar to regular trades via the exchange, but much more formal and involved). Shareholders then subscribe to your offer if they want to sell at your price, rather than placing a sell order on the exchange. If he were just to buy shares off the market, he would be restricted to buying the shares that shareholders wanted to sell (at prevailing prices) anyway, rather than specifically informing them of his intention.\n\nIt becomes necessary to make a tender offer because there are regulations in place regarding a minimum proportion of the company's shares (here, by economic interest, not voting power, I think) to be owned by shareholders not affiliated with or able to directly influence the management. Called ‘free float’, this minimum is 20% in the US, which means that Musk would not be able to perform what's known as a creeping acquisition, buying up shares on the open market, because he would eventually hit that 80% theoretical maximum before he had to make a tender offer, assuming other insiders and active investors agreed to sell to him. Most of the time, investors looking to exert their influence don't need to acquire nearly as many shares. Note how he was already the largest shareholder with a 9% stake, and had been invited to the board."}

You might end up taking less trades or more per month. But there is some balance between accuracy and R2R which will allow you to hit your goal based on your trading style.\n\nA Risk Unit is simply a function of your account size; the consistent trader continues doing the same thing up to a certain dollar-risk level which is feasible given constraints such as liquidity, volume, mental ceiling, etc.\n\nIf you can consistently make $10\/day, all you need to do is scale up to achieve $100 per day, and eventually $1,000.\n\nCheers and best of luck."}

People tend to want to 'get rid' of money because they aren't used to having it. Take some time, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, to just acclimatise to having that cash. You'll have many nights to sleep on it, to think about the best uses, and to not do anything rash with it. Being poor your entire life and then coming into a significant amount of money like this is going to mess with your head a bit.   \n\n\nSolve the urgent things that can be solved with your money, but for everything else, push it back for the next 3 months and work through the shock and panic that you'll be going through. \n\nI would also say, now that you've won at the Races you're going to be tempted to get that hit again. Do your very best to not give into that temptation. There's a common saying - no one leaves Vegas a winner: the losers lose their money, and the winners stick around chasing the thrill until they give back all their gains."}
{"question":"\nIf I buy x20 stocks of a particular company on an app like Robinhood for example at $6 each, I spent $120 and I now own x20 stocks of this company until I decide to sell. I can decide to sell at any time I want. Stocks go up and down in price all the time so as long as I sell on a day when the stock price is higher than what I paid I will make a profit.

Please enlighten me with how stock buying and selling actually works, if not as I’ve explained.","answer":"Stock price isn't only based on the company's revenue. It's also based on popular opinion, billionaires buying and selling, frenzied buys at astronomical momentary prices, any current news, who the CEO is, future projections, and how the media wants to sway the majority opinion of a stock. You're not just selling high and buying low, your playing against companies and investors so big and so influential they can convince you of anything. So do your Due Diligence (DD) study a company, learn about a company, its employees, and find out where it's headed (future contracts or funded capital) and then invest if the numbers add up. \n\nI've been investing for 3 years and I'm still learning.

One thing these countries have in common is [an interesting tax structure](https:\/\/taxfoundation.org\/scandinavian-countries-taxes-2021\/) compared to the US and other EU nations. Businesses pay lower taxes, and the very wealthy pay lower taxes, but the middle-upper class and moderately wealthy pay significantly more in income taxes and social security payments. Businesses also play a much larger role in subsidizing social security in Nordic countries (minus Denmark), and the sectoral bargaining agreements mean that firms have much less monopsony power to keep wages below equilibrium levels. The document I've linked here goes much further in depth regarding tax policy.\n\nOn the welfare side of the equation, Scandinavian countries have some of the most generous child benefits, parental leave, and unemployment protection programs in the developed world, as well as universal education and healthcare. [One thing to note is that Nordic countries also have fairly stringent work requirements](https:\/\/www.iza.org\/publications\/dp\/7084\/in-work-benefits-and-the-nordic-model) for someone to have access to these programs\n\nOne thing to also note is that while these countries have traditionally done a good job of reducing poverty, [it is difficult for unskilled laborers to find work with the collective bargaining agreements that are in place and with how educated the rest of the work force is.](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-sweden-unemployment-pandemic\/new-swedes-left-out-as-economy-powers-through-pandemic-idUSKBN2B91MO) Unskilled work mostly goes to people who have an education and can be promoted to more specialized work when available."}

{"question":"Hi ! \n\nI was reading the comments of two threads on this subreddit this morning and saw that a lot of new investors did not know about the 15% whitholding tax on US dividend in TFSA. \n\nSo quick reminder, most US stocks that are held inside a TFSA will have a 15% tax on the dividend they pay. You don't need to do anything, they take it before you get the money. (Correct me if I'm wrong on this) \n\nHOWEVER, the capital gains are tax free. So for example if you bought 10 MSFT for 100$ and sold them at 200$ one year later, you would have made 1000$ tax free but had lost 15% of the dividend received. ( 2,24 x 15% = 0,33$ )\n\nTo save the 15% tax, you need to hold US stocks in an RRSP because they're is a tax treaty between US and Canada. \n\nFor more details : [Article about this](http:\/\/www.lucierwealth.ca\/Should-you-ever-hold-US-stocks-in-your-Tax-Free-Savings-Account-(TFSA).aspx#:~:text=Unlike%20Canadian%20income%20producing%20assets,avoid%20the%2015%25%20withholding%20tax.)","answer":"Honestly I think people tend to spend too much time worrying about stuff like this. A 15% tax on dividends means a US stock that pays a 4% dividend will instead give you a 3.40% dividend in your TFSA. Sure, if you want to optimize, aim to have US dividend stocks in your RRSP and US growth stocks in your TFSA, but on the list of decisions that affect people's wealth, this is pretty low down on the list."}

{"question":"Hello! I am in the midst of writing several articles about the Canadian housing crisis.

(Not developers but just landlords)\n\nAny articles\/sources are welcomed. Ideally tailored to the non economic reader. Thanks","answer":"Generally they bear risks so renters don't have to. Usually a home owner is responsible for maintenance and repair of appliances and utilities, which requires some amount of budgeting for that. They also have to deal with the investment risks. If the local housing market goes badly they are on the hook, or if the HOA mismanages something they are on the hook not renters, etc. Same for structural insurance and the like. A renter has to insure her own stuff, but the owner insures the property from fires, floods, etc. or in some cases simply self insures with savings. \n\nIt's a trade off, risk for price. To bear the risk responsibly you need savings, some people don't have large savings.\n\nYou could also make an argument that landlords make moving easier. There are lots of hurdles involved in home sale\/purchases, but very little to be done when renting. In this way they can be seen as a way to help increase the 'efficiency' of the housing distribution -- making it easy for people to move closer to work etc.\n\nAs for your question about landlords vs innovative ideas, I'm quite sure they're not mutually exclusive. There are plenty of innovative property management ideas out there."}

He argues that the origins of intercontinental\ninequality at the start of the modern period, five hundred\nyears ago, rested in different historical endowments of\nplant and animal species, which subsequently influenced\nagricultural productivity. In some places, such as the Fertile Crescent in the modern Middle East, there were a large\nnumber of species that could be domesticated by humans. Elsewhere, such as the Americas, there were not. Having many species capable of being domesticated made it very\nattractive for societies to make the transition from a huntergatherer to a farming lifestyle. As a consequence, farming\ndeveloped earlier in the Fertile Crescent than in the Americas. Population density grew, allowing specialization\nof labor, trade, urbanization, and political development. Crucially, in places where farming dominated, technological\ninnovation took place much more rapidly than in other parts\nof the world. Thus, according to Diamond, the differential\navailability of animal and plant species created differential\nintensities of farming, which led to different paths of\ntechnological change and prosperity across different\ncontinents.\n\n\n&gt;Though Diamond’s thesis is a powerful approach to the\npuzzle on which he focuses, it cannot be extended to\nexplain modern world inequality. For example, Diamond\nargues that the Spanish were able to dominate the\ncivilizations of the Americas because of their longer history\nof farming and consequent superior technology. But we\nnow need to explain why the Mexicans and Peruvians\ninhabiting the former lands of the Aztecs and Incas are\npoor. While having access to wheat, barley, and horses might have made the Spanish richer than the Incas, the gap\nin incomes between the two was not very large. The\naverage income of a Spaniard was probably less than\ndouble that of a citizen of the Inca Empire. Diamond’s\nthesis implies that once the Incas had been exposed to all\nthe species and resulting technologies that they had not\nbeen able to develop themselves, they ought quickly to\nhave attained the living standards of the Spanish. Yet\nnothing of the sort happened. On the contrary, in the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, a much larger gap in\nincomes between Spain and Peru emerged. Today the\naverage Spaniard is more than six times richer than the\naverage Peruvian. This gap in incomes is closely\nconnected to the uneven dissemination of modern industrial\ntechnologies, but this has little to do either with the potential\nfor animal and plant domestication or with intrinsic\nagricultural productivity differences between Spain and\nPeru. \n\n&gt;While Spain, albeit with a lag, adopted the technologies\nof steam power, railroads, electricity, mechanization, and\nfactory production, Peru did not, or at best did so very\nslowly and imperfectly. This technological gap persists\ntoday and reproduces itself on a bigger scale as new\ntechnologies, in particular those related to information\ntechnology, fuel further growth in many developed and\nsome rapidly developing nations. Diamond’s thesis does\nnot tell us why these crucial technologies are not diffusing\nand equalizing incomes across the world and does not\nexplain why the northern half of Nogales is so much richer\nthan its twin just to the south of the fence, even though both were part of the same civilization five hundred years ago.\nThe story of Nogales highlights another major problem in\nadapting Diamond’s thesis: as we have already seen, whatever the drawbacks of the Inca and Aztec empires were in 1532, Peru and Mexico were undoubtedly more\nprosperous than those parts of the Americas that went on\nto become the United States and Canada. North America\nbecame more prosperous precisely because it\nenthusiastically adopted the technologies and advances of\nthe Industrial Revolution. The population became educated\nand railways spread out across the Great Plains in stark\ncontrast to what happened in South America. This cannot\nbe explained by pointing to differential geographic\nendowments of North and South America, which, if\nanything, favored South America.\n\n\n&gt;Inequality in the modern world largely results from the\nuneven dissemination and adoption of technologies, and\nDiamond’s thesis does include important arguments about\nthis. For instance, he argues, following the historian William\nMcNeill, that the east–west orientation of Eurasia enabled\ncrops, animals, and innovations to spread from the Fertile Crescent into Western Europe, while the north–south\norientation of the Americas accounts for why writing\nsystems, which were created in Mexico, did not spread to\nthe Andes or North America. Yet the orientation of\ncontinents cannot provide an explanation for today’s world\ninequality. Consider Africa. Though the Sahara Desert did\npresent a significant barrier to the movement of goods and\nideas from the north to sub-Saharan Africa, this was not\ninsurmountable. The Portuguese, and then other Europeans, sailed around the coast and eliminated\ndifferences in knowledge at a time when gaps in incomes were very small compared with what they are today. Since\nthen, Africa has not caught up with Europe; on the contrary,\nthere is now a much larger income gap between most\nAfrican and European countries.\n\n&gt;It should also be clear that Diamond’s argument, which is\nabout continental inequality, is not well equipped to explain\nvariation within continents—an essential part of modern world inequality. For example, while the orientation of the Eurasian landmass might explain how England managed to\nbenefit from the innovations of the Middle East without\nhaving to reinvent them, it doesn’t explain why the Industrial\nRevolution happened in England rather than, say, Moldova.\nIn addition, as Diamond himself points out, China and India\nbenefited greatly from very rich suites of animals and\nplants, and from the orientation of Eurasia. But most of the\npoor people of the world today are in those two countries.\n\n\n&gt;In fact, the best way to see the scope of Diamond’s\nthesis is in terms of his own explanatory variables. Map 4\nshows data on the distribution of Sus scrofa, the ancestor\nof the modern pig, and the aurochs, ancestor of the modern\ncow. Both species were widely distributed throughout\nEurasia and even North Africa. Map 5 (this page) shows\nthe distribution of some of the wild ancestors of modern\ndomesticated crops, such as Oryza sativa, the ancestor of\nAsian cultivated rice, and the ancestors of modern wheat\nand barley. It demonstrates that the wild ancestor of rice was distributed widely across south and southeast Asia, while the ancestors of barley and wheat were distributed\nalong a long arc from the Levant, reaching through Iran and\ninto Afghanistan and the cluster of “stans” (Turkmenistan,\nTajikistan, and Krgyzistan). These ancestral species are\npresent in much of Eurasia. But their wide distribution\nsuggests that inequality within Eurasia cannot be explained\nby a theory based on the incidence of the species.\n\n\n&gt;The geography hypothesis is not only unhelpful for\nexplaining the origins of prosperity throughout history, and mostly incorrect in its emphasis, but also unable to account\nfor the lay of the land we started this chapter with. One might argue that any persistent pattern, such as the\nhierarchy of incomes within the Americas or the sharp and\nlong-ranging differences between Europe and the Middle East, can be explained by unchanging geography. But this\nis not so. We have already seen that the patterns within the Americas are highly unlikely to have been driven by\ngeographical factors. Before 1492 it was the civilizations in\nthe central valley of Mexico, Central America, and the Andes that had superior technology and living standards to North America or places such as Argentina and Chile. While the geography stayed the same, the institutions\nimposed by European colonists created a “reversal of\nfortune.” Geography is also unlikely to explain the poverty of\nthe Middle East for similar reasons. After all, the Middle East led the world in the Neolithic Revolution, and the first\ntowns developed in modern Iraq. Iron was first smelted in\nTurkey, and as late as the Middle Ages the Middle East was technologically dynamic. It was not the geography of\nthe Middle East that made the Neolithic Revolution flourish\nin that part of the world, as we will see in chapter 5, and it was, again, not geography that made the Middle East poor.\nInstead, it was the expansion and consolidation of the Ottoman Empire, and it is the institutional legacy of this\nempire that keeps the Middle East poor today.\n\n\n&gt;Finally, geographic factors are unhelpful for explaining\nnot only the differences we see across various parts of the world today but also why many nations such as Japan or China stagnate for long periods and then start a rapid\ngrowth process. We need another, better theory."}

{"question":"Hi Everyone\n\nSince most people get to buy\/sell real estate properties (flats, lands, commercial , etc.) only few times in their lifetimes, everyone learns something or the other that they wish they knew before.\n\n**What was your learning?**\n\nIt could be related to\n\n* tactics from real estate agents\n* some obscure law that you didn't knew about\n* something you realized you should have thought of checking\/considered before buying that land or flat, etc.\n* legal issues or missing some documentation or due diligence\n* etc.\n\nWant to pool your experience and learnings together for everyone to learn from!\n\nFootnote: Originally posted on r\/india but no traction whatsoever. Hoping to get helpful responses from here.","answer":"After doing a few real estate transactions, the things I have noticed are:\n\n1)There is way too much overhead in the form of registration fees, stamp duty, lawyer fees, bribes etc. In any deal, 10% of the price of the property be it land or house goes in covering these overheads. 2-5% brokerage fees are extra. So you could end up paying up to 15% extra in total. If this is an investment for you, your land price must increase by 15% before you breakeven.\n\nEarlier circles rates were very low, so people didn't care as much about these fees but now in many places, circle rates are actually more than the market rates. This can burn a massive hole in your pocket because all fees are a percentage of this.\n\n2) Following up on the previous point....buying below circle rate is problematic even if it's legitimitate. I had to cough up a huge amount of money in advance tax this year because of section 56(2)(X) as I bought a parcel of land 20% below circle rate last year. This is just adding salt to the wound because I already paid all the fees and duties based on circle rate.\n\n3) Real estate brokers will vehemently request you to pay money in cash. Don't pay the circle rate amount in cash no matter what. It's illegal to purchase any immovable property with more than 20k in cash. Sub-registrar should ideally refuse to register the property but they don't check anything and you will get notice from IT dept later. The sale deed itself may be nullified and invalidated in such cases.\n\n4) Check if there is any lien on the land. It's possible the owner may have taken a loan on this. Do not buy this unless and until the land owner clears the loan and gets an NOC for it. The land owner may request you to foot the money required to clear the loan outstanding. If you agree to do this, write down everything in a sale agreement along with the cheque number and get the sale agreement registered with the sub-registrar. Broker may insist on a notarized sale agreement to fool you but you must register it to get legal protection. Since the legal system in India is slow as molasses and agreements can often not be enforced, it's best if you avoid giving any money altogether before registration is done.\n\n5) Once you have paid the token money, ask the seller to produce the original title deed. He should have no objection to it. Do not be satisfied with a Xerox copy. If he has taken a loan on the land from the informal sector such as a local moneylender, there won't be any encumbrance on the land that will show up on official records but he won't be able to produce the original deed.\n\n6) Always verify the plot number of the plot you are being sold. Get the plot map from the tehsil or municipality and either verify it yourself if you know how to read maps or pay some money to the tehsildar or patwari or some other competent authority and take him to the site to get it verified in person. If you are shown one land by broker and then another land is registered in your name, you are done for and there is very little recourse later on.\n\n7) Always check for clear title of the land. Inherited land often has multiple stakeholders. Each stakeholder can individually sell off their share in the land without permission of the other stakeholders. Often the seller will show the best portion of the land to you to make the sale attractive and then the other stakeholders will raise a dispute after sale. Now you are screwed. You can't just take that juicy corner plot with road access and build your house as per your fancy and leave the crappy plots behind for others.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that you will become a joint tenant with all the stakeholders after sale and you will NOT have the right to claim any part of that land as exclusively your own. To mitigate this, there should be a written deed on stamp paper that mentions which portion of the land belongs to which stakeholder and it should be signed by all. Without this document, every stakeholder has equal rights to use all parts of the land equally. In addition, on the day of registration, all stakeholders must be present in the sub-registrar's office so that they don't raise a hue and cry after all is said and done.\n\n8) Get your property mutated as soon as registration is done. Don't dilly dally. Real estate sector in India is a mess as is the record keeping. Sale deeds can easily be falsified and it's not uncommon to find the same land sold to multiple people. Sub-registrar checks nothing before registering a deed. Later you find that multiple people are laying claim to the same piece of land. Indian judiciary will take 30 years to sort out that mess. Unless the property records show your name, the deed is of little value. So get your name mutated into the land records as fast as possible. Pay a little here if you have to in order to fast track it.\n\n9) Always hire a lawyer to do some basic due diligence. It will cost you not more than 5k and he will not only verify the title but also prepare the deed and help with the registration formalities. However, since land records are also available online in most places, you should do your own due diligence too. Whatever you see online is what the lawyer will see too. If the property is not in the seller's name, it should immediately raise a red flag. If it's in his ancestor's name, he should provide you with the succession certificate to proof that he has claim over the property.\n\n10) It's very tough to do a proper title verification when it comes to inherited land. So sit with the seller and try to draw the entire family tree in a visual manner on a plain piece of paper. The family tree should start with the original owner and then branch on to the inheritors. Verify this information with the other inheritors who are still alive (stakeholders). This is to make sure the seller didn't miss out on a brother or sister who may have a claim on that land. Now sit with the lawyer and figure out what percentage share of the land the seller actually has as per the family tree and whether it matches with the seller's claim. If seller claims that some stakeholders have sold their stake to him, ask him to produce the sale deeds and mutation certificates for the same. This is a long and arduous process. Take your time.\n\n11) Before registering and paying for any land, go to the tehsil office and request the ameen (land surveyor) to come to the site and measure the land in his official capacity. Some places may require you to fill up a form for this and submit the requisite fee. It's important you get this done. This is to make sure you are getting the exact measurements and land area seller promised you. Then buy some angles and barbed wires and ring fence the entire plot. Wait for a couple of weeks while you carry out the legal due diligence. If nobody shows up and creates a ruckus, then it's probably all good and you can proceed.\n\n12) Before finalizing a deal, be sure to ask the broker how much he is going to charge. 1-2% is the norm in most places but for small deals, the rate can go up to 4-6%. I got a rude shock when my broker asked for 5% after the registration was done for one of my deals. In another deal, broker didn't take any money, probably because he got his cut from the seller.\n\n13) Last but not the least, check if all land taxes have been paid for and all dues are cleared. Land tax is usually very little in most places, so that's not something you need to be worried about. But still why fork out an extra 10k or 20k later on because the previous owner didn't pay his dues?\n\nBuying land anywhere in India, especially in rural area is tough because the record keeping is so poor. Do as much due diligence as possible and leave the rest to fate."}

Therefore you should sell”, then I’m not surprised you got flack because that’s not addressing their main thesis. Hodlers of AMC (and GME) aren’t betting on current measures of traditional fundamentals (“last 12 month PE ratio”, “book value”, etc.) They’re betting on value of a different kind (and it’s not just FOMO buying, though that doesn’t hurt). It’s like if you went long on an undervalued company for the long term and someone told you to sell because the Fibonacci resistance levels on the hourly chart are against you. They might not be wrong per say (assuming Fibonacci resistance levels are valid), but it’s simply not relevant to your strategy. If instead you provided concrete evidence that all shorts had covered, then you would have had a much better reaction because that’s useful to the main thesis (granted, it probably still would be a controversial post, and you almost certainly can’t produce such evidence because the regulatory systems in place have loopholes to let financial institutions fake short interest numbers).\n\nTo be frank, I’m pretty surprised that many value investors (probably including the great Buffet himself) view AMC\/GME with such disdain. Back in the day, Buffet himself found “financial stupidities” in the market where a company was trading for less than just the assets the company owned. He would invest in these stocks even though people thought he was crazy for investing in a “failing company”. I won’t speak for AMC in particular (I haven’t done as much research on AMC), but GME is very much in this vein: the market heavily over-shorted the company, the company is making a turnaround, and now the price needs to adjust back upwards.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can play your strategy while others play theirs.

{"question":"If I didn’t know any better, I’d say Solana is gonna hear from the SEC pretty soon. Their ability to shut down the network on a whim today proves extreme centralization, thus making them a security. And, this has happened several times. Other areas of concern are they have 600 nodes managed by three companies, 95% of total tokens are owned and controlled by VC, Team members, and the foundation. 5% of tokens in circulation are available to purchase. Most of that 95% of the market is locked in staking and has a two day unlocking period. Sending good vibes to the small bag holders that big bags don’t dump. After thoroughly reviewing the project, I’m just not brave enough to catch this flight.","answer":"I am prepared for the downvotes, but let's speak TRUTH to what happened.\n\nSolana was NOT SHUTDOWN on a WHIM. It was overloaded! Very similar to a DoS attack. What is a DoS attack? It is when a server is bombarded by requests so that it cannot function. This happens because servers are limited by their hardware. (think of what happens when you try to run a computer game on max graphics on a crappy computer, it becomes so laggy and your computer might even crash.)\n\nThe reasons why SOLANA stopped working is because of some DeFi project that was spamming transactions on the main chain. Solana has a max TPS of 46,000. But this DeFi project triggered a bug that was creating transactions past that limit. All the validators failed because of their inability to process the sheer amount of transactions that was occurring because of this bug.\n\nAlso think about this logically, why would SOLANA shut down their own network on a whim? That's a nightmare. Also how would that even work? The blockchain has open source code, if this was true, please point to the code that allows this functionality.\n\nI'm not saying this was a NOT a bad event. But SOLANA is in Beta. The dev team of SOLANA has owned up to the bug in their code. It is what it is. Shit goes wrong. People have every reason to sell their SOL because of this issue, it looks bad. It is bad. But they found the bug and they are fixing it."}
{"question":"I apologize in advance for how morbid this post is. I am in no way supporting this, I'm merely curious. \n\nLet's hypothetically say that when covid-19 first started, the U.S. decided to do nothing and simply let the disease run it's course and kill anyone that was vulnerable. In March, the Imperial College of London estimated that without intervention, as many as 2.2 million Americans would die. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety places the value of a human life at around $10 million dollars. By this calculation the 2 million excess deaths would cost the economy $20 trillion. \n\nHowever, most of the deaths would be senior citizens who are at the end of their working life and have no more earning potential. Their remaining assets would likely be transferred to their families after death. Covid-19 has already cost the US $16 trillion; from a strictly economic standpoint, would it have made more sense to not address the virus and let it run rampant?","answer":"This is, unfortunately, very much so going to be speculation. Of course, the Imperial College study is already a long time ago in the quickly moving news cycle, and whilst other studies also estimate the [effects of a lockdown](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/goatsandsoda\/2020\/06\/09\/872441984\/modelers-suggest-pandemic-lockdowns-saved-millions-from-dying-of-covid-19), it is difficult to estimate how many lives it would've cost. The important notion here is that mortality rates aren't linear. The study above estimates the amount of cases in april to be 14 times as high if no measures were taken. Seeing that many hospitals and ICU are already overloaded, mortality rates would've spiked. Plus, many choices would've needed to be made on who gets to be treated, and those choices as well affect everything else.\n\n\n\nAs such, I don't think I'm qualified to give you actual numbers. But I do think you underestimate the long-term effect of a shock to population numbers. The reasoning now is that, whilst people may not be visiting your restaurant now, at least there will be people left to visit your restaurant after the pandemic. You have to realize that the people who have ''no more earning potential'' do have spending potential, and inflate the value of assets. Much of the economy, for example, is tied to the housing market. If many younger citizens inheret land and houses relatively suddenly in areas in which they do not wish to live, they will sell these assets causing a housing crash, for example. In that case, those receiving inheretance will in fact not receive much, whilst those who passed away kept the economy partially running with their expenses. \n\n\nThe thing is, there are many ways in which such a scenario could play out. For example, people may even change their behavior to an extent by which it simulates a lockdown. If many people around you are starting to pass, you will be less likely to visit a restaurant and demand working from home if possible. The thing is that *if* you are going to go through a lockdown, you may as well start early - this gives healthcare the chance to find a cure and\/or improve treatment (ICU care has for example dropped from on average a few weeks to a few days).\n\n\nEdit: A wise thing to do would be to look at counterfactuals. [Sweden](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-53664354) for example, has had much less strict regulations. They do see a smaller shrinkage than the EU average, but still, -8.6% compared to -11.9% is not that big of an improvement, and, if recovery is larger in the countries hit worse, the long-term effects may be minimal. Also very important when doing a comparison is to think of the contextual differences; many expected, for example, Africa to be hit very badly by COVID - but this is not the case. This makes complete sense as many African populations have a) more experience with the regulations (due to e.g. Ebola) b) generally live in much more secluded and rural communities (a big reason why contagious diseases have historically plagued Africa less) and c) have an, on average, much younger population. Comparing apples to apples is really difficult here."}

{"question":"YouTube for example is full of people trying to teach you how to profit from stock trading, what is the point of wasting time micro managing stocks when index funds exist? Am I missing something?","answer":"There is a small, but nonzero chance of your stocks doing better than index funds. If you do your research into a firm and have an understanding of the industry it's operating in, you may identify smaller firms that will grow significantly more than indices. Investing in a stock index is basically the ultimate in diversifying in the stock market: Your chances of making huge money go down, but your chances of losing money also goes down.\n\nThen the videos themselves can be useful tools to understanding how the stock market works and getting some grasp of economics. So even those who do not participate might watch and come out better. \n\nOn the flipside, the romanticization of the first paragraph's concept, where you could make more money by betting on individual firms rather than on indices brings in viewers as well. The potential rewards of having first put money into Facebook and come out 5 years later with millions of dollars is attractive, if incredibly unlikely. Despite the unlikelihood of this, it is still powerfully attractive to some people, enough to keep a few Youtubers making guides on how to invest, despite them possibly giving advice that would cost their viewers money in the long run.\n\nFurther, some people find it fun to manage their own stocks. In this case, making money may not be the primary goal, but instead finding successful businesses and rooting for them, as a hobby is. Like most hobbies, this may cost money but it can be fun."}

{"question":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DanPriceSeattle\/status\/1309696726425628672\n\nRestaurant industry profit margins are very low, so it seems to me that any franchise paying this much would be bankrupt instantly.","answer":"I was curious about this question so looked into it. First, based on research done by [Politifact](https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/factchecks\/2014\/sep\/03\/other-98\/can-you-make-45000year-mcdonalds-denmark\/), it looks like the average wage is about 2x in Denmark compared to the US, so let's put aside 3x.\n\nNote that relative prices (and wages) are tricky to determine, because of fluctuating exchange rates. Actually today a Big Mac in Denmark costs [less](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/274326\/big-mac-index-global-prices-for-a-big-mac\/) than a Big Mac in the US. About 7 years ago, though, the Euro was up to 20% higher and so was the cost of McDonald's food in Denmark. If we take a rough estimate of around 5% higher price under a \"normal\" exchange rate, we still have a lot of explaining to do to show how Denmark does it profitably.\n\nFor a fast food restaurant, labor costs are much less than half of total expenses. [This](https:\/\/smallbusiness.chron.com\/common-food-labor-cost-percentages-14700.html) industry publication says it is around 25-30% of total expenses (so does [this](https:\/\/www.7shifts.com\/blog\/restaurant-costs\/) one). Food cost is also around 30%. Other costs include real estate, equipment, management, marketing and utilities. The rest is profit (to oversimplify).\n\nSo, if labor cost goes up by 100% and revenue goes up by 5%, that creates a 20-25% pressure on the profit margin that has to be addressed. Apparently average margin for a franchise is 5-6% in the US.\n\nI think part of the problem here is the assumption that labor costs actually go up 100% in Denmark. With a middle-class wage, there is definitely a lot less turnover in Denmark and that reduces cost. Turnover is a huge problem in fast food restaurants, where [130% turnover](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/08\/29\/fast-food-restaurants-in-america-are-losing-100percent-of-workers-every-year.html) in a year is common. Turnover creates costs in hiring, training, and lost productivity. Just using the first web [source](https:\/\/www.peoplekeep.com\/blog\/employee-retention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee) I found on this, the average cost per instance of turnover is around $3,000, so at a rate of 130% that's around $4,000 per employee per year, which would raise the cost from around $20,000 annual labor cost for staff to $24,000. That doesn't count lost productivity, so Denmark restaurants can also probably make do with fewer employees on a shift, on average, for a given volume of orders.\n\nNow I'm spitballing, but if front line management is also paid better in Denmark and has a higher retention rate, then it too is likely to be more competent and efficient. This can translate into all sorts of other relevant changes, like lower presenteeism and less wasted food. While I haven't dug deep enough to put numbers to it, perhaps half of the total cost difference can be attributed to a higher quality, lower turnover workforce.\n\nThe only other thing that occurs to me is that McDonald's in Europe has a much higher volume per location than in the US (see annual [report](https:\/\/corporate.mcdonalds.com\/corpmcd\/investors-relations\/financial-information\/annual-reports.html) for US vs International data, which consists mostly of Europe). The revenue per restaurant is roughly double, so that also suggests greater efficiencies are possible in Europe, which probably shaves several more percentage points off the cost of operations."}

Why is it only 13.3%?","answer":"First of all, unemployment benefits only count one side--people who have lost jobs. They don't count people who got jobs over that period of time. Second, the workforce no longer consists of 164M people. As you can see in the link you posted, it did consist of \\~164.5 million people in February, but as of May (the most recent figure), it includes about \\~158.2M people. This suggests that as some people lost their jobs, they simply chose not to look for work.\n\nThe most recent [Employment Situation report](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/empsit.nr0.htm) includes some more details:\n\n&gt; Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 2.5 million in May, and the unemployment rate  declined to 13.3 percent  \n&gt;  \n&gt; The unemployment rate declined by 1.4 percentage points to 13.3 percent in May, and the number of unemployed persons fell by 2.1 million to 21.0 million  \n&gt;  \n&gt; The labor force participation rate increased by 0.6 percentage point in May to 60.8 percent, following a decrease of 2.5 percentage points in April \n\nSo TL;DR, there isn't 40 million people unemployed, there is 21 million.

{"question":"In a 1987 letter Warren Buffett wrote: “after ten years on the job, a CEO whose company retains earnings equal to 10 per cent of net worth will have been responsible for the deployment of more than 60 per cent of all capital at work in the business.” \n\nI understand that he's talking about the importance of allocation skills but I can't figure out how he gets to the 60% figure.

Let’s say your company has a net worth of $1 billion. If you retain earnings equal to 10% of net worth every year, by year 10, your company’s net worth compounds to $1*(1.1)^10= $2.594 billion. Of that amount, $1 billion is attributable to allocation decisions made prior to those 10 years (since that’s what the company was worth at the beginning).

{"question":"I’ve often heard that having a tax rate that is too high would negatively impact economic growth, but im somewhat confused as to exactly what the mechanism is. \n\nI’ve heard it argued that taxing the rich more will lead to less investment, but if the money is spent on redistribution to the poor\/middle class, shouldn’t it make up for that by giving rich people more money because those people will spend more on goods and services? \n\nI’ve also heard it argued that high taxes and subsequent spending would hurt economic growth because it would reduce the incentive to work, but I don’t really get that argument either. If people go from working say, 40 hours a week to 30 hours week, wouldn’t that not hurt growth but just hurt the total GDP? Like as long as labor gets more efficient shouldn’t growth still happen? \n\nAt the same time though, it seems impossible to me that we could just increase taxes on the rich forever without any downsides, so what gives as taxes go up?","answer":"**TL;DR Earning more money is a significant incentive for working harder, longer and producing more outputs.

Even in isolation this is difficult, but introduce the complications of the actual real-world tax system, with different rates, deductions, types of income and types of earner, and it gets very complex indeed.\n\nLuckily the question you've asked is fairly straightforward, but i'm going to make some assumptions so I can give you a clearer answer (assumptions in brackets): how does increasing the (personal income) tax rate affect economic growth (all else being equal)?\n\n**Note**: the effect of higher rates of \\*other\\* taxes, like the corporate tax rate or consumption taxes, is different again!\n\n**Ok with that said, Incentives!**\n\nA lot of tax policy is about trying to understand how different types and rates of taxes affect people's incentives to save, work and spend. Let's start with a very simplified case study. \n\nEconomists tend to assume (there are exceptions) that we can expect people to be rational actors who attempt to maximise their utility subject to a set of constraints. People derive utility from having money (because it allows them to buy things), and they also derive utility from not working (because it allows them to have leisure time). We also assume that people make their decisions \\*at the margin\\*. For example, you might be willing to work 4 hours in a row for $20 an hour, but after 4 hours you're tired and cranky and ready for a break, so $20 is not enough to work the 5th hour. If the pay got upped to $40 an hour, however, you would be willing to work through your tiredness for hour number 5. \n\nTo pre-emptively address a common critique of economics by non-economists: yes, not everyone is rational or has the same incentives! But, on average across a whole economy, assumptions about people being rational actors *tends* to be true enough that it's predictive.\n\n**A simple economy**\n\nUsing this trade off between work and leisure, and our marginal willingness to work, we imagine people making decisions about how much to work. For simplicity, let's imagine I own my own pie business. I make pies at a rate of 1 pie per hour, and I sell those pies (let's imagine there is infinite demand for my pies so they always sell) for $20 per pie. I live at home, and all my food and housing is paid for by my parents, so I just work to have money to spend on things I like, like travelling and model trains.\n\nI might decide that 30 hours a week is the perfect balance between earnings and leisure time, and my contribution to the economy is 30 pies, in real terms, for which i'm payed $600. We could assume from this that, after 30 hours a week, the wage i would demand to work the 31st hour is more than $20!\n\n**Tax policy (gone wrong!)**\n\nNow let's imagine we increase income taxes. We want to be progressive, so we introduce a tax of 50% \\*only\\* on people earning more than $400 a week. This means that, after my first 20 pies, half of my marginal income is now paid in tax. \n\nNow, instead of being paid $20 for each extra hour that I work, after my first 20 hours i'm paid $10! I'm still pretty fresh after 20 hours of work a week, and I'd like a bit more than $400 in total, but i'm not going to work the full 30 hours - maybe I decide to work 25 hours. After 25 hours, i'm willing to keep working for $20 an hour, but $10 just seems too low.\n\nWhat happens to my contribution to the economy? Well I used to make 30 pies a week and now I make 25. If everyone in the economy is like me, on average, the result would be a roughly 15% decline in Gross Domestic Product! \n\n**Ok, but like, there is more to the economy than pie?**\n\nOur preceding example is very simple, but it demonstrates a basic mechanism behind the impact of higher income tax - by reducing the marginal returns to work, higher tax rates incentivise people to work less and hang out more. The higher the tax, the less the effective return for working an additional hour is, and the more likely people are to work less. \n\nYou can see that it rests on a few assumptions. In addition to the assumptions we laid out at the start, in my case study I can choose how much to work, don't need a certain amount of money to survive and face no uncertainty - I get paid hourly. \n\nMuch of the economy today is not like that - some people work jobs that are paid annual wages, others would work \\*more\\* if their wages went down in order to meet their minimum living requirements, and still others have salaries with large variable components like bonuses or performance targets. \n\nSome of these things reduce the effect of income taxes on work incentives, or even reverse them. But, on average: high income taxes mean lower incomes, lower incomes mean people face weaker incentives to work and produce. Even if the taxed income is redistributed by the government, the total pie ( ;) )  is still smaller than it would have been.\n\nDoes this mean we should have no taxes? Not at all - apart from anything else, the government uses tax revenue to provide many goods and services that are core to the modern economy, like infrastructure and education. Some trade-off of total GDP for equity is also totally reasonable. But we should understand what the trade-offs are, and how to reduce them. Some types of taxes are more distortionary than others, so we should decide on the level of redistribution that we want, and use the combination of taxes and spending to get there as efficiently as possible."}

{"question":"Asking here as I suspect that there will be knowledge individuals who understand this crisis. \n\nI thought the Ofgem price cap was there to prevent energy companies making record profits at the expense of consumers being gouged. I also thought that the price cap was going up because energy wholesale costs were rising (so, I appreciate that energy companies can’t buy energy units for £10 and be capped at selling those to us for £8).\n\nBut… energy companies are making record profits. I mean, RECORD.\n\nSo why does the price cap have to go up?! Is it just that we have a legislative mechanism that we can’t control. If energy companies are still making 10s, 100s millions and billions in profits, shouldn’t the price cap remain where it is?","answer":"You seem to be confusing energy suppliers with energy producers. \n\nEnergy suppliers like Octopus, Bulb and Scottish Power buy energy at the wholesale price and we pay for energy from these suppliers - in most cases they don’t produce the energy themselves.\n\nIt is producers like Shell that are making record profits not the suppliers - suppliers have seen massive drops in profit and a lot have gone out of business."}

{"question":"According to Why Nations Fail, China appears to have a significant amount of the issues seen in failing nations, albeit does seem to have fairly strong institutions. \n\nSo the question is, can China avoid the fate of states with their similarities, by massive state spending on developing an innovative knowledge run state, or is it destined to fail?\n\nEdit: I realise it's a more normative than positive question, but still interested. And not looking for some crappy communist capitalist slap fight either. More interested in extactive vs inclusive societies and how that may manifest in China's future.","answer":"Acemoglu’s work doesn’t describe a binary — there aren’t just failed or successful states — a country’s institutions can fall on a spectrum of more or less inclusive. \n\nEg, maybe Sweden or wherever is extremely inclusive, Spain a little less so, Malaysia has serious flaws, and somewhere like Equatorial Guinea is a truly failed state. And each will reach some steady state economically — E. Guinea will have most people dirt poor until it has better institutions, Malaysia will be better off than most places but not truly rich, Spain will be rich but not as rich as it could be with better institutions, and Sweden will be somewhere near the top.\n\nChina went from having some of the worst institutions in the world, which caused mass famines, disease, suffering, and cultural destruction, to a place where most people can at least have a shot at an education, a modest wage, and can even maybe start their own business. Accordingly, they’ve gone from a dirt poor country to one that’s still fairly poor (gdp per capita is in the ballpark of Brazil or Mexico) but not destitute.\n\nMaybe it will get better institutions, maybe worse, but one might expect it to stay about the same. And it could plausibly stay that way for a long time, and be quite stable. \n\nMaybe economic success has some link to stability, but that doesn’t mean somewhere economically unsuccessful can’t be politically stable for a very long time. It’s not a ticking time bomb.\n\nAlso, just because of Chinas sheer population, even reaching moderate success economically gives the CCP enough resources to be a superpower.\n\nSo, it’s complicated, but there’s no reason to expect an implosion just on economics alone."}

{"question":"There’s enormous demand for childcare, but salaries are low. I know that childcare facilities have to obtain lots of licenses, and it seems difficult to set up new facilities, but there still seems to be a big gap between costs and wages. Is all the profit going to owners of childcare companies? I don’t understand the economics of childcare.","answer":"It largely has to do with the staff to child ratio and how much people pay for childcare.  For example in preschool there are often 2 teachers for 20 children.  Take any price point and see just how much revenue such a class makes... Let's say it's $1,000 \/ month as a round number. This is [slightly above average](https:\/\/www.care.com\/c\/stories\/2423\/how-much-does-child-care-cost\/) in the US, but costs vary regionally.\n\nSo, this is $20,000 in revenue per month if the 20-child class in at capacity. That's $240,000 per year in total revenue.  Two teachers means $120,000 in *revenue* for each teacher. If **all** the revenue went to the teachers that's the upper bound you'd expect.\n\nNow, from that you have to account for many other costs: materials (toys, books, art supplies, furniture), facilities (rent \/ mortgage), utilities (electricity, water, garbage, heating), other staff (reception, administration), other business costs (marketing, accounting, insurance...).\n\nSo, it's reasonable to expect child care centers can only pay the actual care givers in the range $20,000 - $40,000."}

Thank you!","answer":"The banks have centralised catalogue of all the legal properties. If you go with SBI for your home loan then they BGC on the property\/ builder\/ scheme\/ land for all legal documents &amp; approvals.\nIn addition to that you should demand the true copy of existing sales deed and run it through your lawyer. From safe guarding point, always go for agreement registration with all typical safe guards &amp; preconditions that need to be satisfied before the execution of sales deed.\n\nFrom extra caution point, you should also investigate\/ enquire about the history\/ area of society about any issues ( noise, nasty neighbours, next door perpetually barking dog, problematic group accommodations with late night\/ week end troubles, next door leased service apartment, safety\/ crime rate, bad locality, health hazards \/ pollution, water logging, nearby hospital\/ crematorium \/ wine shop\/ school: all these good to have in the area but not next door!, legal status of internal open area of society\/ any new DP road plan cutting through the society premises etc..) and do structural\/ x_ray scanning from some engineer in case construction is old.\nAlso be very clear about additional stuff such as parking lot, water availability, any service &amp; maintenance dues from existing owner, issue getting NOC for sale from co- op society office\/ builder: many times they demand black payments to issue one &amp; this need to be sorted out before hand with the current owner, any legal dispute involving the flat\/society, any claims on same property by anyone else than the guy you are talking to, current name status of original electricity bill,  municipal  property tax receipt &amp; index II document( should be on current owner’s name)- also get it mentioned in agreement that owner will provide all required help and complete process of its transfer on your name with all dues paid beforehand. Also do demand and check original photo ID such as PAN, Passport, Aadhar etc. along with employment &amp; business details of owner at early stage. There is no need to be shy about these things as it’s a legal deal and it always pays to be assertive &amp; practical early than being sorry &amp; cheated later.\n\nAs a side concern, also do check if the property has any ‘vastu dosh ‘ e.g. main door facing south. Irrespective of whether you believe or not in these things, it makes reselling of such properties harder at right market price as many in India do believe in these things and avoid buying such homes. This may also be a good bargaining point if you are for long 15\/20 year plan of staying in that home and don’t personally believe in such things. It’s all about doing cost- benefit analysis at personal level.\n\n Most important is don’t give a single penny as part of the transaction which is unaccounted for in any legal binding and each payment lot need to be legally traceable and mentioned in registered agreement before the final deed. Scammers rely on any such unaccountable payments\/ advances to trap the buyers as no legal action can be taken for such cash\/ black payments. There are certain sellers who purely buy the property for short term profiteering and such people rely on these dirty tactics to exploit buyers as in many cases they do not have all legal documents ready with them as the property is very new and\/ or the owner wants to lock you down while he\/ she hunts for other buyer quoting higher ticket price than agreed with you. Don’t fall for BS like ‘behen ki shaadi’, ‘hospital ka Kharcha ’ etc. used by these people to convince you in giving any unsecured advance money. Once any cash\/DD\/cheque is paid, they start demanding more money, time for delaying the sales deed or increase\/ add black component for sale and refuse to return the paid advances\/ token amount giving excuses like the money is spent. The agreement should also mention time bound repayment of any advance payments in case deed is not executed with all conditions satisfied in stipulated time period ( typically 2\/3 months) post execution of an registered agreement.\n\nTo avoid most of these troubles, people hence prefer buying new flats (especially post RERA act) from reputed builders instead ( by giving due diligence to locality\/ surrounding factors mentioned in 2nd para above.)\n\nIt goes without saying that all above points are general suggestions and you should involve legal expert\/ lawyer during your transaction phase to be on a safer side."}

If you want forward looking metrics search for leading indicators, but know they are not perfect: https:\/\/www.conference-board.org\/topics\/us-leading-indicators\n\nAnyone able to predict the future path of the economy could make a lot of money doing so. Anyone publicly publishing those predictions would be forgoing that benefit... See who is publishing these predictions, what track record they have, what incentives they may be hiding, and then decide if it's worth reacting to their predictions (it almost never is).\n\nMost often the \"prediction\" that we are in a recession start to happen when we are already in one. This is because (by definition) we have need two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction... So whenever we have one quarter (note that 2022 Q1 real gdp was negative) then the predictions start flying fast and furiously (because what people are \"predicting\" is already half true) .\n\nThe reality is that the Fed started raising rates, so a deceleration in investment is expected. But this isn't news, it's something the Fed has announced publicly with a few months advance notice. *A slowdown is expected*. In fact, that's what the fed *wants*! But a slowdown and negative growth are different. Right now the best GDP predictors are all still positive for Q2. See for example: https:\/\/www.atlantafed.org\/cqer\/research\/gdpnow\n\nSo things are slowing, which is what we expect because that's how we reduce inflation. By the way, are the same people predicting recession also deriding inflation? If so they likely have more of a political agenda than an economic one.\n\nCOVID threw almost every historic model for a loop (models not built on data that includes a pandemic won't predict accurately how a pandemic effects the economy). There are a significant number of one time events in the past two years meaning people can justify almost any prediction they want to. Not just Covid, but the resulting stimulus, the TCJA, supply chain disruptions, net zero \/ negative interest rates, and more...\n\nPredicting macroeconomics is hard, and there's no punishment for getting it wrong.

And a black market where prices still go up *anyway*.\n\nPrice controls don't work, especially in a country where inflation is this high. It's a bandaid, and a useless one as well. Ending long running and substantial inflation as we see in Argentina generally requires drastic policy changes and is generally a result of gross mismanagement. Which is often why it survives, incompetent leadership isn't suddenly going to change their ways, and incompetent leadership is not ready to take the at times drastic steps to stop such a trend."}

{"question":"Welcome to the Community Discussion thread of r\/EthTrader.\n\nThis thread is a place for community meta discussion - to learn or make suggestions for how community members could be better served. Donuts are a welcome topic here as is non-donut related discussion.\n\n[Earn donuts for providing uniswap liquidity on the DONUT-ETH pair](https:\/\/cloudflare-ipfs.com\/ipfs\/QmajDWDWim8r6muJP1DgFysEAiWVYFf5spw9itY5MgX24W): 100k donuts distributed each week.\n\n[How to register for Donuts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethtrader\/wiki\/donuts\/how_to_register)\n\n[Previous Community Discussion](\/r\/ethtrader\/comments\/hcjo38\/community_discussion\/).","answer":"Since I'm being criticized like I don't understand what a quality post here is supposed to look like, I'll give you an example:\n\nFirstly, I always post charts. If you're confused at to what you're looking at, this is called \"Technical Analysis\", and a lot of people think it is the equivalent to asset astrology. They might not be totally wrong. \n\nThe point is,  however, that these sort of charting principles are literally programmed into trading bots, and they perform *better than not having those factors included at all*.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about TA, go to school at babypips.com, and understand it like it would be explained to a 5th grader. \n\nSo first, let's look at a weekly chart of the ETH\/USD price dating back to the first bubble.\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lfBars0.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lfBars0.jpg)\n\nThis is how far back we have to go to find relevant *support* and *resistance* levels. These are prices that the asset tends to gravitate towards, based solely on historical levels. When the price approaches a former gravity point, it is considered **resistance**, until it breaks through this. When prices approach from below these levels, it is considered a \"sell\" or \"short\" signal, until it breaks through (with a reasonable error).\n\nThese sorts of price targets tend to be more meaningful when there arent **fundamental** factors (like news, economics, politics,etc) that are influencing the price. More on this later, but fundamentals *always* trump technicals.\n\nSecondly, when a price breaks through resistance from below, that price point is now considered *support*. Based on that weekly chart. $850 was a frequent gravity point in what can be considered a giant head and shoulders pattern. That is your bottom \"long term\" support right now.\n\nResistance, here, is only the all time high. About $1450 depending on where you check. Expect there to be sell pressure here, based on nothing else except for the fact that it is the ATH. \n\nNow, for my *traders* on more frequent timeframes, let's take a look at the hourly chart:\n\n\n [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xAaAWnM.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xAaAWnM.jpg)\n\nThis sort of uptrend channel is very very typical. You see how it behaves within the bounds for the most part? Yeah, that's because the algos are charting this shit based on the same trendlines I'm drawing.\n\nTypically, you get a \"sell\" or \"short\" signal when it breaks down out of this trendline pattern. Again, independent of fundamental factors, And youd start looking for temporary support\/resistance levels the same way we did on the weekly (only now on a shorter timeframe). \n\nDoing so puts me around $970 with a downside target:****\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Wi8QeHZ.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Wi8QeHZ.jpg)\n\nSo all that being said, hilariously, I'm basically now going to tell you that although all of that charting is a worthwhile exercise, that is *NOT* what is primarily driving this market.\n\nYa'll need to be listening to CNBC in the morning, and hearing the hype crypto is starting to generate again. Bitcoin has basically been characterized as a \"store of value\" asset on the order of gold, and its anti-inflationary properties are being touted as \"unparalleled\" in a time where the fed is literally printing money out if their asses. This run was very well predicted this past summer, because of just that.\n\nSo why is Eth a laggard to bítcoin???? This shouldnt be surprising at all. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, the name recognition, and it's in the mouths of the pundits on CNBC. It IS the digital gold.\n\nBut that isnt where the crypto story ends, obviously. The utility of the blockchain is kind of the entire point of the tech, not as a store of value. The applications it has in so many industries (banking, credit, notaries, contracts, conditional wire transfers, wills, the list goes on and on)  is why this shit popped off in the first place (and why Eth nearly surpassed BTC in market cap). It's what drove the second wave of hype the last time. Expect it to happen again.\n\nWhen the BTC market becomes saturated with exposure, expect Alts like Eth, OMG, LiteCoin, etc to dominate the \"Crypto talk\" news cycle, as investors who missed the BTC train scramble (again) to get exposure to the insane rally. \n\nThe difference is, ETH now has \"Proof of stake\" and a million other actual applications on its resume from the past couple of years, and this will **very very** clearly separate it from the pack. Eth is a $2000 coin, and very soon. Just watch to see the conversation move towards the principles I've described. \n\nSo the long and the short of this post. Buy and hold Eth now. This run is just getting started. If you want to trade on lower timeframes, go read up on TA and post charts\/news. That is super fun and I love to see people doing that. It's a healthy market to have short sellers and traders. \n\nThis is obviously a very long post, but the details I mentioned here is what comments should be based around here; not simply reaction to every little price move. \n\nHope this can be an example of how to  make this forum a better place."}

{"question":"I am trying to understand how cryptocurrencies have value. I always thought money had value because you can translate it back to gold or silver, and this made cryptocurrencies look like an absolute joke thing. In university i took a basic economic class and there i found out that we dropped the gold standard a long time ago. I was taught that the money we use today has value because people trust it has value and trust that people will accept it as a currency, and the demand for it determines its worth. Is this true? Could someone just clarify it a little bit, maybe with an example? I don't think i understand it well enough. And if i am off my rails, please correct me.","answer":"Yes, for \"normal\" fiat money this is definitely true.\n\nBasically, $10 have the value of $10 because you can buy $10 worth of goods with them. $10 worth of bananas, or screws, or Pokémon cards, or weed, or whatever. You could buy the same stuff for the same $10 tomorrow and you could have done the same yesterday.\n\nPeople have faith in the USD being stable and reliable and that faith is verified every day because every day people go out and spend USD and get the value they expect.\n\nWhile the USD isn't technically backed by anything, you could look at it in the sense of being \"backed\" by the entire US economy because all the USD out there can buy all the goods and services offered in the US.\n\nCryptocurrencies behave differently. Their value doesn't come from your ability to freely and reliably exchange them for goods and services.\n\nThere are basically two angles you can take.\n\nFirst, you could say that *today*, no you can't purchase a lot with them, but you will be able to in the future, once they take hold in the economy and become widely used an accepted. They still have value because of their ability to purchase goods and services, it's just that the point where they have that ability lies in the future.\n\nOr you could say, well it's a bubble. It has value because people think it does and think it will gain value over time. Of course if it never actually has any \"real\" value, the bubble will eventually collapse and cryptocurrencies will return to their \"real\" value, which is nothing.\n\nThe truth lies probably somewhere in between those two extremes. Really, we don't know yet. At least some cryptocurrencies certainly *could* become useful currencies in the future, we don't know yet."}

It’s my understanding they’re past the pandemic (or so they say) so exporting goods shouldn’t have any effect no?\n\nThanks everyone for your knowledge.","answer":"It's a complicated question. A short answer might includes things like:\n\n1. Supply chain hiccups in various intermediate components and raw materials during the pandemic leading to shortages in finished goods, driving up prices\n2. Poorly managed health risks in workplaces and reduced availability of things like suitable child care have reduced the available labor pool of people willing to work for lower wages; this hasn't seemed to raise wages yet but reduced labor availability can lead to reduced output and shortages\n3. (controversial\/dubious) stimulus payments and increased UI benefits may have reduced the opportunity cost of not working, further reducing labor supply\n4. demand spikes from relaxed restrictions\n5. aggregate effects of stimulus policies reaching markets for consumer goods\n6. it just might *seem* like prices are skyrocketing now just because inflation has been so low for so long\n\nAnd FWIW, most lumber is produced domestically or in Canada, and most to all of P&amp;G's diapers for the US market are produced domestically too.

You will get higher demand for some goods and it's perfectly possible that goods bought by poor(er) people will go up in price.

What was also discussed was that the idea of distinct modes of production are now largely seen as incorrect. Economies are mixed, and they always have been. \n\nI know about medievalists largely abandoning the term “feudalism”, for example. So from a historical &amp; economic perspective, does what we consider to be “capitalism” actually exist, or is that the economy  has simply grown more complex?

Hoping you guys would share some simple examples about my question. Thanks a lot","answer":"A good current example is how some countries are subsidizing gasoline and\/or natural gas (or price ceilings) in Europe at a time when there are supply decreases. Sounds great! Something is more expensive, magically make it less expensive! However, a subsidy is a negative tax, artificially increasing demand just when you are worried about people using \"too much\" of something causing price spikes. Right now supply is very inelastic, so the only way out is to allow the price increases to decrease quantity demanded.\n\nInstead of subsidizing the exact things that are temporarily more scarce, if you are worried about the effect on poor people, you should give them money.  This lessens the shock to these people, and at least gives them a chance of spending the money on a substitute good (perhaps they will buy a heat pump instead of using natural gas to heat their houses)."}

Within a few months, I slowly started to feel different. Like I had more energy and more free time.

I had time to worry about other stupid things. \n\nBeing poor is like being in an emotionally abusive relationship. \n\nSide note: the job I got I didn’t qualify for. I just pretended I was qualified, made the interviewer laugh and seem personable (not me at all) and got it. Then worked my ass off to learn the job and prove I was a good employee.\n\nEdit: appreciate the award all. If you have the funds, give to some shelter or program in your local area for me.

{"question":"It seems to be a consensus among economists that immigration is generally beneficial. \n\nHowever, I came across this paper (https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/jep.25.3.83) which argued that removing all restrictions on labor mobility could increase world gdp by roughly 50-150%. \n\nIs this true? Is this paper reliable? \n\nOn one hand, I'm generally sceptical of claims that big and that grandiose. On the other hand, it seems like a legit paper (and it has over 700 citations)\n\nThanks in advance!","answer":"As others have said, the paper is reliable in the sense it reflects academic consensus. But modelling on situations that have never happened before should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nIf every nation suddenly opened their borders, there would probably be a net benefit to GDP. Would the benefit to GDP be 50 to 150%? Maybe. Its only a best guess.\n\nYou also have to reflect on how different cohorts of the population are affected. The poorest in the world would benefit the most being able to move to richer countries to work. Some of the existing poor in richer countries might suffer because of the massive influx in competition for menial labour. And of course, capital would benefit a lot fuelling inequality.\n\nIn that sense, it would probably just be like globalisation on steroids. Massive boosts to GDP and decreases in absolute poverty but with great increases in inequality, communities torn apart etc.\n\nAnd then there are the unexpected consequences...\n\nEdit: Changed the wording to remove some of the certainty around the existing poor being harmed by immigration. There is mixed evidence on this point."}
{"question":"I'm a socialist (or, some flavour of one) and I often hear people try to blame all of Africa's problems on the west and the legacy of colonialism. But I have my doubts about this. So what are the accepted explanations among economic theory and research for the poverty of Africa relative to Europe (and North America and the West Pacific)","answer":"There is no one answer to this. In my own studies of the cultural reasons I mainly came across the \"extractive institutions\" approach of Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson and the effects of slavery empirically studied by Nunn.\n\nYes, I agree that it **may** be naive to think that colonialism accounts for the entire discrepancy between wealth across continents. However, it would be just as naive to think that it has not played a significant role. Institutions play a large role in the long-term wealth of a nation. If, for some reason, western colonialists installed more exploitative institutional systems in Africa compared to in North America, this effect can persist for a long time. I have read several hypotheses on why different institutional systems may be installed by colonialists but the factor that seemed most credible to me is the preexisting conditions for Europeans to settle in the colony.\n\nGoing down the slavery route, Nunn found that, within Africa, countries exhibit less trusting cultures if more slaves had been \"stolen\" during 1400-1900. African slaves were mostly captured by fellow Africans and possibly even friends and relatives. Culture persists through generations and it is not controversial to believe that less trust is detrimental to growth. Just imagine allocating capital efficiently in a society where the lenders don't trust the borrowers.\n\nEdit: Typo in controversial."}

{"question":"Our population has barely grown, and we continue to add new homes.  Yet housing prices are up nearly everywhere.  I might expect this in San Francisco.  But Cleveland?  Pittsburgh?  I know individuals with 50 to 75 homes they rent.  Is that business model radically distorting the market?  Most people I know with “typical” jobs are in the $10-12\/h range, not enough to pay a $2,000\/month rent.  So, where is this heading?","answer":"The issue isn't so simple so that you can just take total supply and population. Each state, county, and metro area have different zoning and land regulations which can influence housing price. Furthermore, housing is a heterogeneous good, meaning they are all different. It also doesn't change the fact that real income change and costs of living are different in each state. Furthermore, the consumers of housing can vary. \n\nThe consumers of housing have different preferences. There are factors such as different household sizes, age groups, martial status, and income. Preferences for apartments, condos, row housing, single family, can all affect housing prices. \n\nWhile we would like to simplify the problem of housing, its a field where planners and economists spend a great deal of time trying to figure out the problem.

{"question":"How was the market sentiment back then? Go and talk to anybody around me nowadays, including a barista in the coffee shop. Everybody seems to talk about \"investing\" in stocks and\/or crypto. Kinda **foollish** to think that I am not a part of the mob driven by trends too. Although I tend to consider myself as a \"value investor\" with long-term horizon (however, nowadays who doesn't).\n\nThere is a reason for equity price to inflate so much (QE \/ helicopter money \/ low interest rate etc), but boy, it's not a healthy way for society to have so many market participants chasing short-term gains.","answer":"&gt;How was the market sentiment back then?\n\nI've been investing since 1992.  The market was very different back then.  Except for the 1998-1999 dot com, there really was not the wide-spread mania behind stocks for most normal folks.  Trading costs were a lot higher (a discount brokerage commission was $10 a lot, and options trades were much higher, $25-35 a trade minimum).  We didn't have widespread social media focused on investments now (there were some niche AOL, Compuserve, and usenet groups, but they didn't attract millions of users).\n\nSo, today's mania is different from what I've seen in my lifetime, which is very widespread gambling by people without much means, fueled by huge wins on social media (hello, Roaring Kitty), and enabled by easily available information and very low trading costs.  On top of that, long-term bond rates are the lowest they've been in my lifetimes, so otherwise conservative investors are putting most of the investment into equities.\n\n&gt;it's not a healthy way for society to have so many market participants chasing short-term gains\n\nWhether it's healthy or not remains to be seen.  People will always chase what they see as an easy route to riches.  In the US, it just happens to be stock, most other countries, it's real estate.  In some ways, today's environment is good for the average investor with much better investment disclosures, the internet, cheap trading costs, and amazing liquidity in ETF's and options.   It's the current valuation environment that is poor, but that can change very quickly."}
{"question":"I was told by r\/AskHistorians this question is more fitted for economics, so please forgive me if this question is too history related.\n\nI recently started to wonder through all farming slaves did (the crops, cotton, etc). through all the transportation, and buildings slaves labored at. (ex: white house ). Through what little slavery did for the economy and capitalism in America( from what I heard slavery wasnt really better for the economy but i may be wrong). Through everything the slaves did before the conclusion of the civil war, what did they contribute?\n\nBasically, would America be where it is today if it weren't for slavery? Or was their impact on America's success too minuscule?","answer":"There's two versions of this question: what did African Americans contribute and how would that contribution have been different if they were paid as free labour, not slaves. I'm going to address the second question, as I have some sources to hand. \n\nFor a start, clearly the American economy, outside the southern States, continued to prosper after its Civil War. Even the classic slave produced good, cotton continued to be produced in rising numbers. US cotton exports continued after the civil war. The US's Federal Reserve in [May 1923 published an article on cotton financing](https:\/\/fraser.stlouisfed.org\/files\/docs\/publications\/FRB\/1920s\/frb_051923.pdf). As part of this, they discussed cotton exports, and published a table (page 567 or 33 in the pdf), showing cotton exports of 1.9 million bales in 1850 and 2.9 million bales in 1870, rising up to a high of 10.7 million bales in 1911.\n\nAnd this was despite a drop in labour inputs: The end of slavery *is* estimated to have resulted in newly freed cotton workers reducing their labour supply by up to a third (as an aside, in and amongst the various miseries of the Black experience in the US South I like to dwell on this good news - that emancipated people gained that improvement in their lives). Interestingly, cotton productivity relative to labour is estimated to have gone up during this period despite the fall in hours worked: the hours of labour required to produce a 100 lb of cotton lint was estimated at 82 in 1860 and 68 in 1870 (Craig and Weiss, 2000, page 8): cotton pickers may have been working fewer hours, but they were working more efficiently.\n\nUS cotton did have an advantage in world markets independent of slavery: a particular variety of cotton, G. hirsutum, made for very nice cotton and US slaveholders developed varieties that grew particularly well in the climate and soil conditions of the US south (Olmstead and Rhode, 2008). Adapting this variety to other primary cotton-growing regions of the world, was a much slower process.\n\nThe other side is that US industrialision started in the northern states, where slavery was illegal. There are long arguments about whether the industrialisation was financed by cotton, or perhaps cotton was a retardant. The question of US industrialisation is why did the US industrialise rather than remain a primary producer like Canada or Australia or NZ, focused on trading agricultural and mining products to Europe in exchange for manufactured goods? One argument is the US's tariffs, introduced to protect US manufacturers. If it had not been for exports of slave-produced goods like cotton or tobacco, then the US$ real exchange rate would have presumably been higher against the European currencies, providing a similar incentive to domestic manufacturing.\n\nFinally, slavery was by its nature a violent and destructive process, naturally prompting resistance by its victims. Given the evidence that social trust is important for economic prosperity, slavery's legacy plausibly continues to reduce economic output today. \n\n**Sources**\n\nRansom, Roger. “Economics of the Civil War”.

{"question":"To my limited understanding, Sweden has nailed their economic model – they manage to sustain a high-innovation, socially-supportive economy that I think should be the model for America and elsewhere.\n\nAs I understand it, this is the result of mechanisms that include:\n\n* High income and consumption taxes, with substantial government spending allocated towards free healthcare and education\n* Incentives for entrepreneurship (inc. paid leave of absence to start a company)\n* Low taxes on capital (wealth, property, inheritance)\n\nMy question is in the title: Why do they prefer income and consumption taxes to taxes on capital (are they intending to incentivize entrepreneurship, or is this not the explanation)?  And does this have downstream effects for inequality (Sweden seems to have a pretty low Gini coefficient)?","answer":"People get confused over capital income taxation. Consumption taxation schemes like X tax end up looking almost identical to corporate income tax schemes, but the key difference is that consumption taxes have a constant implicit rate with respect to time while capital income taxes do not. **This is an extremely disireable property** and its why many countries prefer consumption taxation. This is not an easy thing to grasp but once you understand this distinction I think it becomes a lot more clear how it's possible for consumption taxes to be progressive. \n\n[My comment here goes over the difference in detail](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/badeconomics\/comments\/huy7cu\/the_single_family_homes_sticky_20_july_2020\/fyviv02?context=1).\n\nA benefit that is not covered by that comment is about tax enforcement. Basically it's much more difficult for the wealthy to avoid taxes if the tax code is simplified. Some economists argue that you need to have a ton of different \"tax gateways\" to prevent the wealthy from slipping through the cracks of the tax code. I find this argument uncompelling. It's much easier for the IRS to be lazer focused on enforcing taxes on a small number of cash flow sources rather than trying to tax income at a bunch of disparate points. The benefits will be nontrivial because of chronic underfunding. If you can afford accountants to navigate the complex tax system, then you'll end up avoiding paying some of the taxes that normal people will pay."}
{"question":"According to the film \"The Big Short\", many economists and banks think that the housing bubble burst won't happen because \"who doesn't pay their mortgage?\" Why did economists-- including Alan Greenspan-- think there won't be a housing crisis? I get that one of the points the film has mentioned is that there hasn't been a housing bubble burst in history and people have become complacent, but it seems naive to think that that will never be the case, especially that there have been alarms raised by other economists before?","answer":"Housing prices have been increasing for a long time, even if you adjust for inflation. This is true not just in the US, but in most of the developed countries. Here is a time series of a house-price index in the US https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CSUSHPINSA\n\nThere are many contributing factors. I will name a few. \n\n- Population keeps growing but the amount of land stays the same. Although there are other important factors in the short run (such as income and interest rates), population dynamics play an important role. https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/aer.104.4.1172\n- Technological progress can help build taller and cheaper apartment buildings, but it cannot help us build more detached homes with big yards in zone-regulated suburbia. Zoning laws greatly restricts the housing supply https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/000282805774669961 a counter argument to this is that high speed rails and remote working might reduce the importance of living close to your workplace. \n- Globalization and the development of countries that used to be poorer has increased the demand for housing in North America and Europe. This is both coming from people who buy property for personal use, and for international investors that are happy to hold vacant property as a form of investment. \n- Some people use their residence as their primary form\ninvestment. Which makes sense given that the capital gains on your residence are usually tax free or have tax advantages https:\/\/uctpmcg.github.io\/WebsiteData\/OldAgeSavingsandHousePriceShocks_McGee2021.pdf\n\nIn fact, if you look at the graph I posted, housing prices are increasing at a faster rate right now than they were right before the 2008 crisis. The low interest rates and high construction costs during the pandemic have greatly contributed. Do you think we are in a bubble right now? \n\nEven if you believe you are in a bubble, it is difficult to predict whether it will pop soon or not. Do you think housing prices will collapse soon when the interest rates raise again and the supply chain issues go away? These things are always difficult to predict. \n\nAfter losing a lot of money trying to ride a financial bubble Isaac Newton famously said “I can predict the motions of the heavenly bodies but not the madness of people”. \n\nInterestingly, even the popping of soap bubbles war very difficult to predict until recently https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/full\/10.1126\/science.1230623?"}

But in South Korea that doesn’t seem to be the case.","answer":"Robots do not always kill jobs. In general, they can be complementary or competitive to labour as a production input. Robots and automation increase productivity - meaning more can be produced with no change in the supply of labour. If demand is constant, this can result in lower prices (and loss of jobs if technology is sufficiently labour-replacing). If demand is increasing, higher productivity and higher demand for labour are both possible.\n\nIn global markets, the extra production can be exported and bring profits\/wealth into the country. Being the most productive means being able to produce more than others with fewer inputs - meaning profits can be achieved at lower prices. As Rob already pointed out, there is no reason to think that technology has a negative effect on labour demand in the long run. It can create short-term issues in particular industries or sectors, but at a national level, robotic density says more about the technological state of society than it does about employment."}

{"question":"I don't know the numbers or degrees, but I know that economic downturn certainly harms human life, and isn't just 'about the money'. Unemployment raises death rates for sure, right?

It's also not like quality of life counts for nothing, and bad economic times clearly hurt quality of life for many people, and may also shorten life expectancy for some. Long story short: Depression also bad, yes? \n\nSo, it seems clear to me that our actual goal is to balance the interests - preventing the disease from harming people, and preventing the economic contraction from harming people - in the way that does the least damage overall.

{"question":"I've never liked tipping just because plenty of companies make billions from the service they provide, and I think they should be the ones paying more. It's the business that takes advantage of the employees, the customer, and possibly other businesses. This happens with ride-sharing apps, delivery apps, restaurants, bars, you name it. Oftentimes these businesses charge pretty dang high too. So why make the customers pay twice for the service? Also, why do people think it's rude not to tip?","answer":"I grew up in a country where nobody tips as a matter of course (tips can be left, but they're completely discretionary, not expected.)\n\nSo moving to the US was definitely a culture shock, since tips here consists of a \"baseline tip\" (the \"If you can't afford to tip here you can't afford to be here\" portion) and a \"merit tip\" that can be added on top of the baseline tip which is what other countries would actually treat as the entire tip.\n\nIt's toxic in several ways, but here are just two that annoy me:\n\nBecause it's an expected part of the compensation, employers consistently underpay their workers to pocket the difference themselves. The minimum wage for tipped workers is only $2.13\/hr, which enshrines that dishonest business practice into law.  \nSince employers don't pay a living wage to tipped workers and workers have to rely on tips to survive, tippers don't just reward workers, but can also punish workers by withholding their baseline tip, a concept completely absent in other countries.  \n\nThat last part is why it's problematic to not tip at least the baseline tip. Yes the system is bad, but not tipping that baseline tip only punishes the workers that already have no power over that system."}

{"question":"The only reason I can think of is that cutting Russia off from the SWIFT network would push some countries to adopt a blockchain-based monetary system, which in turn would reduce their reliance on a US-centric international monetary system.\n\nIs this the main fear?

{"question":"I recently became a millionaire this past month at the age of 29, but realized that my life has not materially changed in any way. I still have to continue going to my day job as I can't afford to live off my investments in my HCOL area. I've done some calculations and my fatFIRE number is 7-8M. I would be able to live very comfortably on that number and could splurge  here and there but I would still need to budget. With inflation, that number could be 10M when I turn 40 in a decade. This is also assuming that I stay single and\/or have no kids in the future.\n\nGrowing up, being a millionaire was always viewed as extraordinary accomplishment and it still is, but today a million dollars doesn't take you very far. The term millionaire was created in the 1700s or 1800s. Adjusted for inflation, a million dollars in 1900 would be worth around 30M today. I don't think you need 30M to be considered rich, but a millionaire is not what it once used to be.","answer":"Flip side: Is it as much as it used to be? No, but it’s still a lot.

The ability to secure 5x (more if you're willing to live there for a year) leverage on an asset that's not likely to sting you for doing so.\n\n2.) Depreciation - usually your cash flow is largely untaxed.\n\n3.) Amortization - in addition to your cash flow, your mortgage is being paid off each month\n\n4.) Appreciation - not the main appeal for me, just assume it will follow inflation (this year was a nice bonus, though)\n\nA super-simplified example of a deal I would take is something like $30,000 cash to close and $200 in cash flow per month. 8% returns, not bad... but everyone forgets the amortization. As I pay off the mortgage each month, I'm also gaining equity. On a $140,000 house, you're looking at about another $200 per month of principal pay down. Now we're looking at 16% ROI. And it's usually untaxed.\n\nReal estate investing is way more work than the stock market. Nobody would do it (I certainly wouldn't) if the returns weren't better."}

But I wonder about significant changes in economic theory in this century. Are there any and if so, which?\n\nSorry if this isn't too specific. It just crossed my mind and I am not sure if there is better place to ask such a question.","answer":"Microfinance. In the 90's and early-mid 2000s it was all the rage and many saw it as a panacea that was going to lift the poorest of the poor out of poverty. If only people had access to credit, they could invest in their businesses and pull themselves up. The problem was that poor people have no collateral, so there's no way to make sure they pay the loans back. So some microfinance pioneers like Mohammad Yunus (Nobel prize winner) came up with the idea of using social capital as collateral. By giving loans to many people in the same village, and making additional loans contingent on everyone paying back the initial loan, social pressures will make sure the loans get repaid. After all, nobody wants to be a social pariah and the reason their neighbor can't get additional loans for the business. They also gave the loans specifically to the women of the village, because data shows that women are a lot more likely to invest the money in their family, rather than just consume it, and [much more likely to repay the loans](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0305750X10002330?casa_token=TbShxsgnrjgAAAAA:Cu4SvsRGc5sr8j-MbBT1vPpH4It2xCKpw7BR-oAZR4V7wP_X9oDAOQox-MwtZST8BrBJ5isykrg).\n\nTurns out it doesn't always work so great. Access to credit leads people to take risks that they wouldn't ordinarily do so, and perhaps aren't well suited for. Businesses are started by people that cannot manage them or do not have the tools to be successful. When they go bankrupt and cannot repay the loans, the entire village is punished, which has obvious social implications.  [The UK government funded a synthesis study in 2010](https:\/\/eppi.ioe.ac.uk\/cms\/Portals\/0\/PDF%20reviews%20and%20summaries\/MICROFINANCE_WEB%2019March11.pdf?ver=2011-03-25-130509-613) that details a lot of the problems that were unforeseen. \n\nThis is not to say that microfinance is all bad. It simply isn't a panacea and must be implemented very carefully. Access to credit and the banking system is really critical for giving poor households the ability to save money, manage economic or other shocks, and get loans needed to start businesses."}

It is cheap relative to what it offers in terms of PE\/EBITA\/cashflow, because the company is mature and in a stagnation. If you scroll back on the chart to 1999, you will see that VZ was trading at an ATH of 64$ (which it has never broken).

{"question":"If US has the privilege of printing their own money to pay off previous debts and buy goods from around the world, why can't they just print it endlessly and pay it off altogether ( especially foreign debts ? ) Would that immediate flow of Dollars out to the world destroy the economic fabric of the world?","answer":"The problem is that you can only do this once. Money supply is around [20T$](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/M1SL), and federal debt is around [29T$](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/GFDEBTN). As debt is issued in dollar, and not in, lets say, Euro, the US could indeed print 29T$ and pay all their debts. There are two problems with that. First, if you ever want to borrow money again afterwards, people are going to demand a very high interest rate and repayment in different currencies. So you can get out, but only once. Second, in the short term, it would still destroy the value of the dollar, meaning that the buying power of US citizens would drop. This would also make the US more competitive, boosting exports, but in the short-run it will mostly likely solely have negative consequences."}

Thanks again for having me 👊","answer":"My $0.02: it is imperative that real retail investors know that they’re ‘buying’ and ‘selling’ shares that are not necessarily deposited into their accounts. Unscrupulous brokers can just take their money and add ‘1’ to their balance to convince them that they were just credited a share. If the user sells at a loss, the broker just hands the sale amount, debits the share from the user’s account and pockets the difference. If the sale is for a profit, the broker just shrugs and gives the money over. Plenty of other people will sell at a loss anyway. \n\nThis is why we suspect that brokers like RobinHood shut off the ‘Buy’ button in Jan 2021, when the price of GME started skyrocketing. They didn‘t hold the shares, and would have been on the hook for actually paying out of pocket. \n\nAnd the best way to counteract that is to Direct Register all GME shares, using GameStop’s Transfer Agent, ComputerShare. You might have seen all the purple circles on this subreddit. That is all retail investors buying shares via ComputerShare, or transferring shares from other brokers like Fidelity. We’re also tallying it all up using our DRSBot. \n\nEven GameStop has started announcing the DRS’ed shares during their quarterly filings. So far, we have locked up about 9 million shares, a significant portion of GameStop’s micro cap. \n\nThis results in real shares drying up in the market, and corrupt short hedge funds are resorting to more and more naked shorting to keep the price of GME suppressed. There are some times when the price starts to rush up, but it‘s always beaten down by the bad faith actors. And this corruption is entirely evident to anyone capable of a little technical analysis. As quite some folks on here are. \n\nThe SEC is either corrupt and useless, or incompetent and therefore useless. GameStop can‘t even ask us shareholders to DRS our shares because the SEC might declare that market manipulation. \n\nWhat we need to do is to keep DRS’ing, and spread the word out to as much people as possible so they can protect themselves. The bad actors have the full might of CNBC &amp; Jim Cramer and other bought &amp; paid for financial outlets. We have just our voices. \nAnd that is why I just gave this essay to someone who really doesn’t need to be taught what DRS is. \n\nWe would love it if you could use your reach and voice to try to educate folks NOT on Reddit to DRS their shares. And not just for GameStop. There are quite a lot of shorted companies out there. If those shares become unavailable too, the bad faith hedge funds and banks reducing America and the world to a slavish hell hole will run out of ammo and steam fast. \n\nAlso, I read somewhere that you’re friends with the YouTuber Mr. Beast. If you both were willing, introducing this subreddit to his channel might spread the word super fast. There are quite a lot of highly educated, intelligent and knowledgeable folks (Dave Lauer,  Dr. Susan Trimbath, Jon Stewart himself, to name just a few) who have educated us and been educated too. We are always willing to teach new users, although bad faith actors embedded within this sub sometimes try to make that difficult. \n\nYou entering our sub is a rare opportunity for exposure we have been struggling to get.

{"question":"Volkswagen AG, the world's second-largest automaker, has joined Tesla's lobbying camp in calling on the Indian government to lower import duties on electric cars to spur demand for cleaner vehicles.\n\nGurpratap Boparai, managing director of Volkswagen's Skoda Auto India, said that even if import tariffs on electric cars were cut to 25 percent from the current level of up to 100 percent, it would not pose a \"huge threat\" to domestic companies in India, but would instead help drive investment.\n\n[Volkswagen Joins Tesla in Calling on India to Lower EV Import Duties](https:\/\/www.asiantechpress.com\/volkswagen-joins-tesla-in-calling-on-india-to-lower-ev-import-duties.html)","answer":"Unpopular Opinion, but I think we should wait a bit in lowering import duties on EV. Not much, maybe 2yrs?\n\nHere is my argument(feel free to disagree and point out flaws, I welcome it)\n\n1. India is in a very nascent stage of EV adoption, we should first finalise on our EV standards. Testing Standards, Charging Standards, Power Delivery Standards. US is facing challenges due to different plugs by different manufacturers, whereas in the EU, they have a standard, and manufacturers have to comply or provide adapters.\n2. Wider accessibility of charging stations is a must, now with the right standards, we should have higher availability of these as well, across the country. If there aren't enough charging points, people will not buy EV, without mass adoption, International players may not see the sales they hope, and might just walk out of the country. It is an egg-chicken problem, but the Govt. should start putting a few charging points in cities at least (primary target for EV vehicles).\n3. Indian manufacturers like Tata, Mahindra, Hero, Ola are doing amazing work in the EV sector. Moreover, startups are working in this space to better battery tech, power delivery, availability and cost reduction. They should be given some time to flourish, make errors, learn and course correct. If Tesla, VW, and others enter the market, so will their money. It will kill all these startups and innovation Indian manufacturers are working on.\n\nIt would be amazing to have a flourishing EV ecosystem, but I would also like to see India take the lead in the same. In the next 2-3yrs, we will see EV options across segments (scooters, bikes, super bikes, cars), and with more competition, the cost will come down as well.\n\nIf we play our cards right, if we let our homegrown brands to get bigger, it could be a game changer for us. I am all for Tesla and VW and others to come to Indian markets with their EV offerings, but with tough competition from Indian manufacturers and a standardised efficient EV ecosystem, it will be a boon for Indian consumers."}

(I know nothing about gardening so take this example lightly)\n\n3. Sacrifice. \n\n4. Perseverance \n\nI’ll go over those points a little more. \n\n1. You will never be truly wealthy if you’re an employee. You can be a high earning programmer, doctor, salesperson etc. But you’ll never truly be wealthy unless you’re the one who own who owns the company. For as long as you have a boss you won’t be rich. You can be well off with a high salary but never wealthy. \n\n2. Scalability: I’ll tell you a story about a friend of mine from high school. Once he got his diploma he immediately went into a trade school. His profession was plumbing. A lot of people mocked him because he chose a blue collar job while his friends went to pursue degrees at college. He started off by starting his own company. \n\nAt first he had 1 van and just himself. He would travel around the city doing random plumbing jobs. His salary wasn’t great but it wasn’t bad for his age. Once he saved enough money he bought a second van and hired a plumber\/employee to run that van. So now he has two vans , himself, and his 1 employee. He can now do twice as many plumbing jobs and his revenue has doubled. Then he bought a third van and hired a third employee to run that van. Now his revenue has tripled. Today he has over 20 vans and 20 full time employees each operating their own van. He has a receptionist who manages all of the jobs and he is partially retired and he is in his 30s. He doesn’t have to grind a 9-5 anymore. All he does it occasionally call to check in and get progress updates. He is still scaling up and growing. For each of his vans he profits almost $25k a year. 20 vans times $25k is $500k a year and he doesn’t have to work anymore. \n\n3. Sacrifice: this doesn’t always apply to everyone but during my entire 20s (I’m 30 now) I didn’t have much of a social life. I worked like a dog and focused only on my businesses. While my peers went out every weekend to party and had healthy life\/work balances I was living a life of obsession and the only thing on my mind was work. By the end of this year or the next year my goal is to be able to have enough staff to run my businesses without much oversight and my yearly income will be close to 7 figures a year while I do whatever I want. Side note: I do not recommend doing this. It was extremely stressful, tiring, frustrating, and almost all of my personal relationships had gone to trash. I have zero relationship with my family and have no friends outside of work. \n\n4. Perseverance: never give up. I had over 20 failed businesses during my 20s. There were several times where I bet everything I owned on the wrong business and several times I ended up in horrible spots and had to move back home. Take each failure as a lesson and use failure as a learning tool. You can only fail so many times before you hit success."}
{"question":"I see this expression all the time, but I don’t really see how it plays out in reality.\n\nIsn’t almost all the money owned by the rich being continually invested?","answer":"“Hoard” is a politically charged word. This is a difficult question to answer without coming down on one side of a very contentious divide. What people typically mean when they say “hoard” is that rich people are holding lots of their wealth in safe, static assets like cash or Treasury bonds. This money is static because it is subject to certain constraints that prevent it from being used for more productive, but risky endeavors.\n\n&gt;Isn’t almost all the money owned by the rich being continually invested?\n\nYes and no. Not all investments are created equal. When people invest, they usually want some mixture of both 1) safety, and 2) a high return. There is generally a trade off and people will have different preferences depending on their risk tolerance. When people hold cash in a checking account, they are letting the bank do the investing. Banks have lots of convoluted rules for how they can manage assets due to the inherent risk of bank runs like 2008. What’s happening now is that banks are also “investing” in cash and T-bonds to a large extent. Note that cash held by banks at the Fed (called Reserves) is ultimately not really invested in anything. It’s there in large part to back up everything else and provide a buffer in the case of a run. Before 2008, banks didn’t used to hold Reserves in excess of their legal requirements, but during the crisis a lot of things changed and suffice it to say that now they are holding (or from some people’s perspective “hoarding”) more than ever. And as for T-bonds, both private banks and the Fed are investing in the U.S. Federal government when they choose to hold Treasuries. But the government isn’t actually spending or investing in a lot relative to the global demand for its debt.\n\nOver the past few decades, and especially in the last 10 years, the amount of money being held in cash and T-bonds has increased substantially. One effect of this can be seen in M2 money velocity. Basically, M2 money is cash and money held in checking accounts, and the velocity of M2 money is a variable that loosely corresponds to how fast M2 money is moving around the economy. Since this value is decreasing, we can infer that more and more money is sitting around in cash, ultimately being backed up by Reserves at the Fed. Theoretically, the people\/institutions who own this money could invest it in something else that yields a better return. But they’re not doing that. As to why this is the case—that’s a hotly debated topic. One theory is that it’s the product of rising inequality. The richer you are, the lower your marginal propensity to spend. This is just a fancy way of saying that rich people tend to save money while poor people tend to spend it. There is a *huge* desire for saving in dollars right now that far exceeds the capacity of those dollars to be spent, because poor people don’t have any money (relatively speaking). Another theory is that investors are fighting a losing battle against deflation and demographics. The world population is getting older, and there are fewer and fewer young workers per old retiree with each passing year. This has theoretically decreased the opportunities for robust growth, i.e. there really is no good answer for how all that cash should be put to use. Moreover, old people tend to want safer assets, so they are less eager to put their money in relatively riskier investments.\n\nNote that this is just a one picture of what “hoarding” can mean. In practice it can refer to other ways that rich people make inefficient investments. Buying up lots of expensive art or super yachts might also be seen as ways in which rich people are using their wealth in ways that don’t necessarily lead to as much “trickle down” as supply siders like to claim—i.e. hoarding. Think of the dragon Smaug, who hoarded a mountain of gold on Erebor. Perhaps he was afraid the dwarves were going to use it poorly, such as by starting a war with the elves. He also probably didn’t think the dwarves would pay back any loans he made in the first place, and so he chose to sit on the gold instead—an inefficient but safe choice. In the end, he was killed by the dwarves (technically the kill shot was from a man named Bard, from Laketown) due to his greed and the mountain of gold that was spent by the dwarves who acquired it ushered in a literal Golden Age fueled by productive investments in new infrastructure and the like."}

{"question":"At the beginning of 2020 I didn't even know how to buy a stock. Now I have over 44k invested with about $1,800\/year in dividends. It's not much, but still it's like I give myself a little raise every time I add to my portfolio. I never knew growing up how to make my money earn me more money. Family always told me the stock market was a scam and school didn't teach anything about it. I wish I would have figured this out when I was 18 or 19 instead of blowing all the thousands I'll never get back.","answer":"If you want the stocks simply for income\/cash flow, you might want to look at some covered call etfs. Typically they return 8%+ dividend yield and often payout monthly. Basically, you’re $44k would get you approximately 4K per year, dripped back in you \nget the Buffet compounding effecting monthly. \n\nTypically, this strategy is used by retirees that need cash flow to live, very safe depending on which you buy.\n\nCons: less capital appreciation than potentially owning the stock itself, but if your goal is simply cash flow then it could work.\n\nThe theory is that stock capital appreciation is never your money until you sell, but if you are holding that stock for dividends... then the whole idea is never actually selling. Therefore, you really only get the much smaller dividend cash flow, but feel richer on paper.\n\nEx. Buy stock X at $100 with a 3% div, $100,000 = $3,000 per year. Now let’s say stock X goes up to $125 in 5 years, you’ve made $25,000 in capital gains, but you didn’t really because you haven’t sold the stock. Instead you’ve really only gained your $3k per year div (potentially compounded with a drip but let’s imagine it’s just $3k for simplicity). Therefore a total earning of $15k in div and $25k in capital appreciation = $40,000... but only $40k if you sell your shares... will you do that?\n\nPeople end up feeling richer than they are because the number gets so big, but you never actually get that money until you entirely sell out of the position. Most people actually never sell when their stocks are peaking because of human nature\/greed. Typically people end up selling when their capital appreciation goes down basically wasting all of that time holding for only a 3% return per year.\n\nCovered call etfs: basically buy the etf for the monthly dividend and annual div yield of 8%+. Take for instance ZWC (Canada) 8.19%. $100,000 = $8,190 per year. Over 5 years that’s $40,950. That beats the individual stock purchase without having to worry about if you bought a loser.\n\nPros: you get that money! That money is yours, paid out every month. You can do whatever you want with that, it’s yours irrespective of capital appreciation or depreciation. Obviously, reinvesting those divs monthly would compound quite quickly. Basically, your first year of drip would be over $700 more for next year, rinse repeat and the drip keeps increasing. In 10 years with a drip, you’ve almost doubled your returns, now you’d be bringing in almost $16,000 per year, $1,333 per month. Invested in a tax free account and all of that money is yours.\n\nMy perspective: not very much capital appreciation over the years. These etfs are meant for cash flow, not necessarily great capital appreciation returns. So essentially, if you want to beat these funds then you better have an average return of over 8.19%, in this instance, every year, across all of your stocks, for the rest of your life - professional hedge fund managers don’t even return that over 30+ years, we call it reverting to the mean. Most people are bad stock pickers, they get one winner and then have 3 losers. These etfs essentially eliminate that entire stress of picking good stocks or suffering paper hands over losses from picking bad stocks. 8.19% is also on par with s&amp;p500 returns over the past 30 years, in fact a little more... and without all the stress of depreciation.\n\nCash flow is king!\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor, these are my opinions solely. I am not currently employing this method yet but by March I have $300k going into this strategy. Atm, I have a $20,000+ annual div returns account from various stock picking. Like I said above, I’m winning in some and losing in others but an average 5.6% average annual yield on them."}
{"question":"I keep hearing about this and wondering if its true or false. They claim that rich countries buy resources from developing countries and those rich countries manufacture. This manufactured goods are significantly more expensive than the resources they bought from thus they get more money than those poorer countries. While the rich countries wealth grows very fast the poor countries grow at a slow rate since they dont manufacture. Is this true? Another question I am gonna add. What can these poorer or developing countries do to get richer?","answer":"Every reply you've gotten so far couldn't resist pigeonholing mercantilism, slavery, imperialism or colonialism into your question so I'll take a swing at this. While developmental economics aren't really part of my wheelhouse, a good kick-off point would be to refer to the [FAQ section on free trade, protectionism and development.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_protectionism_and_development), but I'll !ping DEV just in case.\n\n&gt; While the rich countries wealth grows very fast the poor countries grow at a slow rate since they dont manufacture.\n\nGenerally speaking this goes against the idea of convergence - the catch-up effect - based on the [law of diminishing marginal returns](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diminishing_returns) as we know it per the [Solow-Swan model](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model#Conditional_convergence). Mind you, the proper institutions and policies need to be in place and there is a lot of literature on the subject of convergence\/divergence so there are some caveats to keep in mind, but a quick look at the [growth rate of real GDP per employed person](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/growth-rate-of-real-gdp-per-employed-person) or [GDP growth per capita](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/gdp-per-capita-growth?time=2012) over the years - as well as a general knowledge of history concerning rapid economical development of poorer countries like the \"Asian Tigers\" or the \"Celtic Tiger\" and various [other similar examples](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tiger_economy) - should be enough to dispell this idea fairly quickly. Notice in the graphs how growth in the West has remained relatively stable and marginal, while Southeast Asian economies have exploded.\n\nAdvanced economies tend to rely on intensive growth through productivity increases much more than developing countries which still have lots of \"easy\" room to grow through extensive growth (= maximizing ones economic inputs like resources and labour and thus aggregate output). One other thing to keep in mind however would be the [Lucas paradox](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lucas_paradox) which begs the question why we do not always see capital flow from rich to poor countries.\n\n&gt; What can these poorer or developing countries do to get richer?\n\nGuarantee stability - ranging from political to judicial etc - and trade."}
{"question":"I'm having trouble understanding the argument from my friend.\nI know people need somewhere to live but I don't understand how being a landlord is contributing to the economy.

There’s no “me” or “you” anymore, we became an “us” when we got married. \n\nThe household needs enough of a nest egg to generate enough income to cover the household’s expenses, regardless of whose name is on the accounts.

So is there a gap in global economy?","answer":"Current m0 (physical money) dollar supply is 6328 billion, which means you're removing 0.0158% of physical money denominated in dollars. Would argue that this would do nothing because most money isn't cash and its such a small amount. Furthermore a larger amount of dollars get made every year. Now lets just say you remove a significant amount of dollars. Then what would happen? Well you would lose that money. The reserve bank would see that there is a lack of liquidity and do the proper monetary policy to fill the liquidity gap."}

Those first few hours\/days\/weeks after diagnosis, you start questioning *everything*, your brain just goes into a kind of hyper-emotional survival mode, and if you're a planner like me, you start reassessing just about every aspect of your life plan\/situation, because it now looks like things are 180 degrees different from how they were just the day before.\n\nBest advice I wish someone had told me at the time... just breathe, let yourself go through the emotions, but hold off on any major life decisions for at least a few months.  Give your brain time to adjust to the new situation and develop a more solid understanding of what you're actually going to be facing.  Once you've processed everything and emotions aren't running the show quite so much, then you can start reassessing things and figuring out if changes need to be made.\n\nI'm now almost 6 years out from my diagnosis and while I'm not cured, the condition is responding really well to treatment, and my prognosis is for a mostly normal life.

{"question":"For example, the Netherlands had a GDP per capita of 57k USD in 2008, compared to 52k in 2020.

{"question":"It's something we hear a lot but is there any truth to it?\n\nMost 'rich' people are business owners who are able to deduct expenses such as employee wages and by purchasing goods. But aren't these goods and wages also major tax sources for the government?\n\nWould there be a more effective way to tax the 'wealthy'?","answer":"It's probably helpful to use an example. Say Company X spends one million on widget components and one million on wages for workers to put together the widgets, then sells the widgets for two million. The revenue was two million but the expenses were also two million, so Company's profit was $0. Because the company made no money, Company X\/ the owner wouldn't pay taxes. \n\n  \nThe workers pay taxes on their income because that's their income. And the goods themselves are taxed. But the owner wouldn't be paying any taxes because they got nothing. Generally speaking**\\*\\***, deducting expenses isn't a magic trick that lets you avoid taxes on income. Expenses are money going out, meaning the company is losing money unless the revenue coming in matches or exceeds it.  \n\n\nIf, instead, Company X made three million selling the widgets, now there's a million in profit.  How that money gets taxed depends on the type of company. Company X could be a simple pass-through entity (like a sole proprietorship or LLC) where the business owner's profits are taxed like ordinary income.  If Company X is a C-corporation, it gets more complicated.  Then, the company itself has to pay taxes  *and* the business owner has to pay taxes on money paid to them, but the rates the business owner pays vary depending on how the money is distributed (income, ordinary dividends, qualified dividends, etc.).\n\n  \n**\\*\\*** I say \"generally speaking\" because there are ways for businesses to use expenses to avoid taxes on profits, which is probably what you hear about. Say in the first year Company X spends a million on widget components, a million on wages, and a million on equipment to put together the widgets, but only makes two million, *i.e.* the company lost a million dollars.  The next year, Company X spends a million on components, a million on wages, and sells the widgets for three million.  There's a profit of one million in year two, but Company X can \"carry forward\" the loss from year one to avoid taxes on that profit.   \n\n\nThat may sound shady but, if you think about it, over the course of the two years the company's profit was $0, so it makes sense there wouldn't be any tax on that. The carry forward provision exists because companies often lose money in their first few years (because they need to buy equipment, market themselves to get a consumer base, *etc.*). So the \"profit\" they make in year two or year three or whenever is illusory because the company had been losing money previously. The carry forward provision allows the company to even out the fluctuation in profits and losses from year to year.  \n\n\nThere's a lot, lot more, and there are unsavory ways business owners avoid taxes, just like their are unsavory ways people earning ordinary income avoid taxes.  But this post is already long enough, and I'm just trying to explain why being \"able to deduct expenses\" isn't nearly as fun, exciting, or profitable as people seem to think."}

{"question":"I did a few economics units as an undergraduate in university and I remember being surprised that there is an economic argument for welfare as helping to mitigate the effects of the business cycle.\n\nI've also seen people argue that, due to the multiplier effect, welfare actually 'pays for itself' in that it generates more economic activity than it removes from the economy.\n\nIs this true?

It depends on when, and on what program as well.\n\nWe should separate two arguments. The first you mention is around business cycles; in these situations some welfare programs can stimulate the economy. Since low-income people tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume, they can grow GDP in the short run. [Auerbach &amp;  Gorodnichenko  (2011)](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w17447.pdf) shows that welfare spending is more beneficial to GDP during a recession, for example. While these arguments have merit, it's important to note that they don't always apply.\n\nIn the longer term, it really depends on what program. \/u\/DrunkenAsparagus linked to a [really good paper on this here](https:\/\/scholar.harvard.edu\/files\/hendren\/files\/welfare_vnber.pdf) (with [accompanying visualization here](https:\/\/www.policyinsights.org\/#)) in another thread. To sum up some of the results, programs vary widely both in their cost to the government and in their value to the recipients. In grouping policy types together, policies aimed at child education and health in particular have a negative cost to the government (meaning they pay back their cost to the government, and then some) and a very high value to the recipients. Some policies pay a portion of their cost back, but not all of it. Some policies can actually impose an additional cost--if they discourage people from working, for example.\n\nLastly, this recent paper from [Bastian &amp; Jones](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/conference\/2020\/preliminary\/paper\/zB4hn9nf) analyzed the Earned Income Tax Credit and found it likely repays about 83% of its budgetary cost to the government."}

{"question":"Printing a bunch of new money the past couple of years is what caused this huge increase in inflation, right? How exactly does raising interest rates combat all this new printing of money?","answer":"There are at least a couple of different ways to think about this. One way is to realize that raising the federal funds target is synonymous with taking money out of the economy. In order to push the rate up, the fed sells bonds and takes that money effectively out of circulation, lowering the money supply.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to realize that higher interest rates disincentivize economic activity. Saving becomes more attractive relative to consumption. Borrowing becomes more expensive, raising the cost of investment and consumption of durables. This lowers aggregate demand and puts downward pressure on inflation."}
{"question":"I’m an entrepreneur with 100% ownership of my company, and I’m considering restructuring to employee-ownership to boost loyalty, performance, company growth, and ethics.[Employee ownership is linked to better company performance on average.](https:\/\/wol.iza.org\/articles\/does-employee-ownership-improve-performance\/long)\n\nThis got me thinking. How would things be different in a society where ALL companies were employee owned? Would the economy flourish better than ever, or would it just not work with certain types of companies? Are there hidden downfalls? Is there a name for this type of economy, and have any authors or researchers ever published anything good expanding on that idea?\n\n(Please don’t say socialism, I’m not talking about collective ownership, I’m talking about employee ownership only.)","answer":"We get asked this every few months, I'm going to copy and paste from some replies I gave recently...\n\nYou mentioned making your own company mutual. Those who advocate co-operatives believe that it can be an emergent outcome of an economy.  So, no dictator is need to force equality.  That's usually the hope behind Mutualism, though your view may be different. There are reasons to be sceptical of this.\n\nLet's say that every business in the economy is a co-operative.  Often it's specified that each business must be a worker co-operative.  Straight away this causes a problem.  What about a co-operative of two people, for example?  Suppose that myself and my wife start a co-operative with £1M of capital.  Another couple have a co-operative with £1 of capital.  The return of these would clearly be very different!  In other words, what is the threshold?  What co-op has so few members that it's effectively private?\n\nAnother issue is different rates of profit.  This can happen for various reasons.  Let's say we have two worker co-operatives each with similar numbers of members\/workers.  These two also have similar amounts of capital.  The members of each vote for the committee managing the enterprise.  What if one co-op elects good management and the other bad management?  In that case the members of one co-op would become much poorer and the members of the other richer.\n\nNotice that I don't have to look at much that's specific about the co-operative form itself here.  What I'm talking about here is mostly just the way every business works applied to the case of a worker co-op.\n\nA related problem applies to capital.  In some industries lots of capital is used.  In others only a small amount of capital.  A window cleaner can use a few ladders, a few buckets, and maybe a van.  A silicon chip company needs more.  That's true per-worker as well.  More capital means higher returns.  So, why should a co-op with a lot of capital look for new members?  New members will only water down the capital share owned by each existing member.  As a result, the co-op will charge new member for joining.  These charges are not theoretical, worker co-ops that exist make them, they're called buy-ins.  (For this reason there's a theory of supply for co-ops that's slightly different to other businesses).  So, some people who are relatively wealthy will be able to buy-into co-ops that are relatively profitable.\n\nIn this Mutualist world capital and labour haven't disappeared. It's just that the roles are fulfilled by the same people. The workers of a worker co-op are both worker and capitalist, as such they receive both labour and capital income. They must fulfil the corresponding roles. They must show patience and not spend all their capital. They must fulfil the entrepreneurial decision making role.  Some people must still decide what products are to be made in what quantities, there must be direction of available resources within each co-op. If the workers do not do this collectively as part of their work then someone must be paid to do it. There must still be investment, so some people must wait before they can get a return. The workers in each co-op will have the right to all of the profit split into shares. But, they must invest in their business for the future, which will often mean retaining some of the profit. Of course, if borrowing is used for investment then someone else must lend. If every business is a co-op then that means another co-op must lend.\n\nHere are some older threads on this subject:\n[thread1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/f0vro3\/why_are_coops_so_rare\/), [thread2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/fqukk0\/what_would_happen_if_every_business_turned_into_a\/) and [thread3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/6qk6tn\/coop_profit_maximizing_labor_quantity_question\/)."}

Provides defense during economic downturns\n2. Adequate stock price growth during bull markets.\n3. Provides a second means of metric\/income.\n\nSCHD Does all the above:\n\n1. Handpicks a select group of stocks that are more defined by marketcap minimum and dividend growth of atleast 10 years. These stocks are much more defensive, and thus do better than the S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ during downturns.\n2. It does a good job with other finances with these companies aside from point #1. As a result when a bull market does hit, you will see growth with SCHD.\n3. The 10 dividend growth requirement will always see it filtering in and out companies with a strong payout, thus giving it a very good constant growth.\n\nThe yield for SCHD fluctuates between 2.5% (all time highs) and 4% (market lows), the key \"safespace\" for a company dividend outside of a REIT. If the dividend goes higher than 4%, the stock usually isn't growing too much or is stagnant. If the dividend is lower than 2.5%, you're better off just investing in the S&amp;P500, which has a 1.5%-2% dividend yield on average.\n\nThis was my research and what I saw with previous dividend ratios in the past. If you try to replicate this in a portfolio as well with a group of stocks, the same thing happens. Higher then 4%? Lower growth of the stock price. Lower than 2.5%? More volatility in the markets compared to S&amp;P and NASDAQ100\n\nI keep SCHD in my brokerage account and Roth IRA."}

For exposition, imagine that a firm has employees who have a distribution of skill from low to high. You can imagine that the low skill workers might be call center employees while the high skill workers might be the people in the CTOs office making big decisions about strategy and toolset. \n\nThink about the firm iteratively considering whether to offshore the next job. Initially they're all located in the US. First the firm looks at the low-skill call center workers and considers the marginal benefit of offshoring them (lower labor costs) against the marginal costs (reduced sales due to weaker customer service, bureaucratic complexity, etc) and decide to move the call center to India. Next they look at the next highest skill workers, maybe the IT help desk. The marginal benefit is still the reduction in salaries but there is a different marginal cost as well. Not having your IT worker in the same time zone could mean that it takes longer for the finance folks to get their problems fixed. Maybe they still decide to offshore the IT help desk. In each case, the firm is considering whether the marginal costs exceed the marginal benefits and will only offshore workers for whom the marginal benefits are high relative to the marginal costs.\n\nAs other folks have pointed out, it's non-trivial to assume that people in other countries do the work as well. Time zone is a huge barrier and the talent pool is generally not as good as it is in developed countries.  The fact that Google is willing to pay people in the Bay Area $250k instead of hiring someone in Delhi suggests they see some benefit to onshoring.\n\n Has the rise of WFH fundamentally changed this equation? I don't think so. In my mind, what's more likely is that employers will offer employees bonuses to leave SF\/NYC\/LA for lower cost of living cities within the US and adjust their salaries (Facebook already did this)."}

I’m so gratified to see real in depth discussions happening every day. \n\nHappy cake day everyone!\n\nPS my original account u\/tamo42 got banned from Reddit for unrelated stuff, and that’s probably the best thing that could have happened for fatFIRE.

It's surprising to me how caustic people in this community can be to people who come here earnestly seeking advice.

Everyone in this community is either in the 1% or aspiring to get there.  It wouldn't hurt to be a little kinder.  Just my 2 cents.  \n\nBut again, thanks for creating this subreddit.

{"question":"I watched a debate between Milton Friedman and some random college student and he makes three claims about the welfare state:\n\n\n1. The welfare state produces poor people.\n2. The welfare state encourages family's to break up.\n3. The minimum wage increases black employment.\n\nHow true were those claims when he said that and how true are those claims today? He said this in the 1970s so I would expect them to be dated.","answer":"&gt;\tThe welfare state encourages family's to break up. \n\nAt the time when Milton Friedman was active, I believe this was commonly thought to be so since there was a strong correlation between welfare generosity (to single mothers) and single motherhood. Then, as economists started becoming more serious about endogeneity, the consideration that 1. areas with more single mothers are likely to pass more generous single mother benefits and 2. areas more culturally ok with single motherhood are more likely to pass more generous benefits, which all would confound and cause a false positive correlation lead to [Moffit (1994)](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/146113), where after adjusting for fixed effects, this relationship disappeared for whites, but remained for blacks. And shortly after, [Hoynes (1997)](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w5149) went further in thinking about confounders, and finds that the relationship between welfare generosity and single motherhood in black families disappears when you account for migration- i.e. welfare generosity does not seem to *cause* families to break up, but people more likely to become single mothers selectively move to states that offer better benefits. I believe this result is generally accepted even today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\tThe welfare state produces poor people. \n\nI have made several posts about similar claims to this, and I think this partially talks to this claim. Using the 'official' poverty measures which are based on income, which people tend to misreport and literally do not reflect increases in welfare (i.e. if you get health insurance coverage from the state, this wont be seen in a measure of your income, but it will be seen in changes in your consumption. Consumption also what theoretically matters more so than income)  and does not properly adjust for inflation, and which also capture alot of young college educated people and others who are not really who we think of as 'poor', then it does not look like many great society and welfare schemes have done much for helping poor people. However when you switch to more accurate consumption based measures and adjust for inflation properly, poverty has actually decreased quite a bit due to anti poverty polices, over the past few decades- estimated up to [26.4 percentage point decline](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w18718). more on how to properly measure poverty and why the 'official' measure is not great can be found [here](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w14827). \n\nI am not to familiar with the min wage literature so I wont address that here"}

I told the wife, once in my life I wanted a 500HP+ car.  I enjoyed it so much that I got to know a lot of people in the industry, like a famous tuner and the Viper factory manager.  That led to the second thing I did that was completely stupid.  \n\nSo I told the wife that just once in my life, I would like a 1000+ car.  I bought another Viper and had the tuner modify it, twin turbo, 1300+ HP, and it was used in and won a couple of magazine competitions against far more expensive cars, like Bugatti.  It made the covers of 4 car mags in the US and EU.  My car briefly held 2 speed records for street legal cars.\n\nI was fun to drive and I raced it at a local track vs Ferrari, Lambo, Mazzers, Astons, BMW Ms, MB AMGs, Porsches, Ford GT, and lots of other things.

I could drive past him on the straights, but he beat me in the curves,  \n\nThe best day ever with that car, Walter Reed hospital brought a bus load of wounded vets and their nurses to the track.

Soldiers with missing limbs, horrible burns, and all sorts of other problems got a day as a passenger in cars that cost anywhere from $200K - $2M.  Many of the soldiers had to be lifted from wheel chairs and placed into our cars. We set it up in 20 min races with very defined passing rules to protect both passengers and cars.  Each race the soldier would swap out and go in a  different car.  \n\nIt was a wet day and at one point, a $1M collectible Ferrari two cars in front of me spun out, going off track and then back across, dragging mud with him.  The Lambo behind him over corrected and spun out in the mud.  I couldn't break because there was another Lambo only a few feet from my rear bumper so I eased up and drove as gently thru the mess as I could.  The Lambo and Ferrari behind me also spun out.  The soldier beside me, looking back at the cars spinning all over yelled, \"THAT WAS AMAZING!! LET'S DO IT AGAIN!!\"  When we got back to the pits, my soldier passenger was telling everyone what had happened and how I was the only driver to get thru that corner.  \n\nThey had to shut the track down for an hour to clean and dry it.

{"question":"I've searched here, \/r\/economics, and \/r\/badeconomics and I cannot find anyone specifically asking \"is this considered good, if pop, economics?\" About the closest I think I found was someone saying a part of the book was required for an undergrad class, which I know is not always an indication of quality.","answer":"It's good with some caveats as best phrased by \/u\/integralds \nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/badeconomics\/comments\/7yc8v5\/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit\/dugzwu2\/\n\n&gt; #The trouble with writing a pop-econ book\n\n&gt; So you're a distinguished researcher in economics. You've made a career out of carefully measuring $input and painstakingly documenting the causal effect of $input on $outcome. Your work is celebrated in a dozen top-5 articles. So you decide that it's time to cash in and write a pop-econ book about how $input affects $outcome.\n\n&gt; You start with a [picture.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/huQ9GG3.png) This is the partial plot of your $input against $outcome. You've waved a magic wand that solves all identification issues, so this *is* the causal effect. Just to be clear, you can run a suitably high-powered [regression](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/480yncP.png) through this data and get an economically and statistically significant effect. Great! [fn1]\n\n&gt; Clearly there's variation you can't explain with $input, because other stuff is going on as well. The world isn't monocausal.\n\n&gt; Anyway.\n\n&gt; Your book has to sell with a popular audience, so you can't just print out regression tables. You have to tell a story. Well, the data in a regression encodes a story: behind the data points in a scatterplot is history of policy across observation units. So you pick out a few [case studies](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/clWeNQF.png) and center the book around an examination of those case studies.\n\n&gt; And you sell your book. And people review it. And everyone wants to take a piece out of you.\n\n&gt; Some commentators scoff at your $input. Look, they say, $input doesn't do anything to affect $output. Look at [these case studies.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5PDPetu.png) We vary $input by a factor of three, and *nothing changes* to $outcome. \n\n&gt; Other commentators point out that many observation units with roughly the same level of $input have massively different outcomes. Look at [these case studies.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yR3Jgah.png) All of these observation units have similar levels of $input, but their outcomes differ dramatically. What gives?\n\n&gt; Some smartass commentators even turn the tables on you.

{"question":"I read somewhere that the 40 hour work week was supposed to be for one person per household. \n\nI would assume that, at first, dual income households saw a big advantage over single income households (on average). But eventually dual incomes became the norm, prices rose, and then it was expected in many ways.\n\nIs that why Boomers are looked at as doing so well, because they hit the sweet spot where women were working and getting paid well but it wasn't yet quite so expected and necessary like today, because they hadn't been doing it for long?","answer":"I'm not quite sure what you are referring to.\n\nReal (meaning adjusted for change in prices) disposable personal income per person is [higher than ever](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/A229RX0) and has steadily increased, as you can see.\n\nPeople are likewise able to buy more.

{"question":"Hi, I'm a teenager looking to get into stocks to make some money and I'm unsure if I should invest in typical blue chips or go with penny stocks? I start with about $500 and trade with either ETrade or Scott trade. Any tips from anyone?","answer":"I am talking about investing here, not trading.  They are very different.  Warren Buffet is an investor, Jordan Belfort was a trader. \n\nUsually people start investing with $10,000.  But you can do it in $500 blocks on sharebuilder.com.  Buy $500 worth of a single stock, then save up another $500 to invest in a different stock.  Avoid buying all your stocks in the same market sector to diversify a little.  Once you have a few, you can buy additional $500 blocks of stocks you already have.  Keep the equivalent of 10% (since you are young) of your stock investment in bonds for security.  As you get older, increase the % in bonds. \n\n0) Unfortunately stocks are the only investment that steadily out paces inflation and interest rates, so you want to buy and hold stocks or ETFs.  Not mutual funds.  When you read Lynch's book it will be clear why.\n\n1)  Start studying \"Dividend Aristocrats\" stocks.  These are stocks that have paid dividends for 25 consecutive years.  Also look at stocks that will soon be aristocrats, over 15 years consecutive dividends.  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/S%26P_500_Dividend_Aristocrats\n\nWhat you want to note is the dividend yield, it is a percentage.  For example for Johnson &amp; Johnson, JNJ, it is 2.9% and for HCP it is 5.7%.  But you also want to look at the dividend ratio to make sure all the earnings are not going to dividends, 80 -110% is bad.  Also look at company debt to make sure they are not borrowing to pay dividends.  For two stocks that are very close to each other, compare Return on Assets and Return on Equity to find the one with better management and buy that one.\n\n2)  Plan to hold your investments for at least five years before you take your profits.  Unless a stock drops 40% (and the whole market isn't crashing the same %) do not sell.  Waiting a few months to a year will see the stock recover and start rising again.\n\n3)  Calculate your 'load' to purchase your stock:  add the fees to buy and the fees to sell, calculate this as a % of your purchase, and subtract it from the yield.  If this is a negative number then do not buy at that yield (price).\n\neg, if it costs you $6 to make a buy and $6 to sell, a purchase of $600 worth of stock has a 'load' of 2%,  so you would earn 0.9% on JNJ and 3.7% on HCP.  (This math is not perfect as it doesn't account for you holding the stock for multiple years but it still works!)\n\nOne more test: compare the adjusted yield to the return on the best bond you can afford.  For you this will be EE or I bonds purchased direct (yay no load!) from treasurydirect.gov.  EE bonds are at 0.1% and I bonds are at 1.38%.  So you would not buy JNJ since it is lower than the bond yield, but HCP is above it so it passes our test.  \n\n4)  Do not try to buy at the best possible price, just buy at a price low enough to get you the best yield.  Using sharebuilder you will not be able to control exactly when the buy will happen, unless you pay for a dealer assisted trade and this is too much for the small buys you will be making.  Since the goal is to buy and hold, small changes in price are not critical.  Timing the market is very difficult, don't try to do it.\n\n5)  The best part about buying dividend paying stocks on sharebuilder is you get free dividend re-investment.  This means you earn a small slice of stock that will then earn you more future dividends.  This creates a compounding effect!  Be sure to set this up in your account.\n\nBefore you start investing you should have an emergency fund and be liquid.  Being liquid means you earn enough money to cover all your expenses.  You must not get in a situation where you have to sell your investments at a loss because you need cash.  Having an emergency fund is to prevent this losing situation.\n\nYou should read, in this order:\n\n\"The Richest Man in Babylon\", \"The Warren Buffett Way\", \"How to Invest $50-$5,000\", \"The Little Book That Still Beats the Market\", and \"One Up On Wall Street\".  If you want an advanced topic look into \"Elliot Wave theory\".\n\nS&amp;P 500 dividend aristocrats list:  https:\/\/www.topyields.nl\/Top-dividend-yields-of-Dividend-Aristocrats.php\n\nI used this method, plus a tech stock I knew well (IBM) to earn over 10% on my portfolio."}

{"question":"Private health care and insurance is a huge market in the US. How many jobs would be lost there if universal healthcare became the norm? Would it be enough for a noticable recession? Is there a way to do this without any ill effects on tbe economy?","answer":"Universal healthcare implies nothing of the sort.\n\nUniversal healthcare in of itself means exactly one thing, that everybody has *access to healthcare*. It tells us absolutely nothing about the actual design of the healthcare system.\n\nFor the US, that could very well mean a vast overhaul and complete shift to a publicly owned healthcare system, or just an expansion of the existing one with relatively minor changes.\n\nDoes universal healthcare imply the loss of jobs? No. Is it possible to have a system of universal healthcare that would cause substantial job losses? Sure. But that could be the case for a non-universal system as well. The actual implementation matters."}
{"question":"I know you need to be consistent and all and not giving up. But i dont understand How some make SO MUCH like billions from it. Because alot of people i have seen on the internet have become rich but not crazy rich like 100 million+ or billionaires level. And thats why im curious How some do it? Inheritence?","answer":"The way I see it, there are three big factors: value add opportunities, leverage, and tax code advantages.\n\n**Value Add**\n\nThink about a house flip: you put in $10k, increase value by $20k or $30k. Now think about applying the same principle to an entire apartment building: 12 units, 20 units, 50 units, 100 units. Whatever you can do in the apartments to increase the rents will increase the value of the building by a multiple of the increase in annual cash flow. You can buy something for $2M and with the right tweaks, turn it into something that is worth $3M.\n\nThe \"ultimate\" value add opportunity is ground up development. It is also the most risky. If you can double your money every 2-3 years, then you will get to big numbers very quickly.\n\nPeople who rely on appreciation to get rich are taking advantage of a similar phenomenon, but they are ceding control of that phenomenon to the economy. You can hope that inflation goes up and interest rates keep going down to push values higher and higher. Or you can take action yourself to push values higher and higher.\n\nControl over the property is one of the best advantages of real estate compared.\n\n**Leverage**\n\nIf the bank will loan you 70% of the cost of the project, then your margins are even better. 20% unlevered becomes 40% levered. You have less money in the deal, which means you can do a bigger deal or you can put the same amount of money to work in more deals.\n\nThe more money you have, the more money the banks want to lend you. You will get lower interest rates and better terms on your loans as well.\n\nIf you want to keep a property after finishing your value add work, then you can refinance it and pull cash out for your next deal that way.\n\n**Tax Code**\n\nThe obvious provision of the tax code for folks at scale is the 1031 exchange. Rather than sell the property, pay taxes on the gains, and use the remaining proceeds for the next deal, the tax code allows for you to sell at the same time as you buy. You don't see any of the cash: an intermediary holds it for you between the two closings. This let's you take advantage of compounding returns on money that would have otherwise gone to taxes.\n\nIf you refinance and take out money that way, then that isn't taxable either because it is debt.\n\nThe another tax advantage in real estate is depreciation. The building does depreciate in the sense that it is used up over time, but it generally does not actually go down in value which makes this more of a phantom expense. Cost segregation allows more of that depreciation expense to be taken earlier on new deals. Then you can write off those losses against taxable rental income from the other properties."}

So how could that be a bad thing?  What am I missing?\n\nEdit:  Thanks for everyone who contributed.  This is actually a lot for me to take in and understand, I am going to have to read and re-read this thread to truly understand.  I appreciate the thoroughness.","answer":"The TLDR is that when you have a change to aggregate demand prices must move to offset this - including wages. Upward changes aren't really any issue, because hey, who doesn't like to be paid more (even if it's just nominal)? However, individuals are extremely hesitant to accept lower nominal wages and this \"stickiness\" results in employers having to fire people because they cannot afford to retain them at those elevated wages, so in return you end up with significant unemployment. This can also cause a vicious cycle because if people have little to no income because they lost their job they will be more hesitant to spend and this can cause a greater shock to aggregate demand. \n\nI understand this is tricky, but it's also extremely important to understanding why deflation is such a massive problem. To further elaborate, I am most familiar with the Great Depression in particular and so will explain why deflation (and the gold standard) were problematic within that context. I am also tired, so pretty much everything I am about to say is also excerpted from [my blog post on the subject.](https:\/\/laowyatt.net\/the-great-depression-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-inflation\/)\n\nUnder the gold standard, each country would provide a pegged exchange rate of their currency for a redeemable amount of gold at some set price. For example, let’s say the price of an ounce of gold is 10 American dollars, while it is 8 French francs. Therefore, $10 USD and 8 French francs are equivalent. To engage in international trade, countries would therefore either use the gold itself or gold-pegged currency (so that more gold could be free in circulation) for exchange, which under perfect circumstances, is fine. However, in the real world problems occur when countries over or undervalue their currency.\n\nIf a country’s currency is overvalued relative to others’ (the pegged price is too high), then their exports will drop because their goods are essentially more expensive. If a currency is undervalued (the pegged price is too low), their exports will be higher because their goods are essentially cheaper.\n\nKnowing this, if a country wants to offset what is effectively a change in price of their exports, they would have to use monetary policy (i.e., change the money supply in their economy) to restore parity. In other words, if your currency is undervalued and therefore your exports are cheaper, a country would need to increase their money supply through an action such as changing the pegged value of their currency to offset this difference.\n\nTo explain in plainer English and a bit more simplified, let’s use the earlier example of USD and francs. Let’s say that although $10 USD and 8 francs are pegged as equivalent (because both have been determined by the country to be worth 1 oz of gold), in reality, it should be $10 USD and 12 francs that are equivalent. Therefore, when Americans are buying goods from France, they are effectively receiving a 1\/3 discount because they are buying 12 francs worth of goods for the equivalent price of only 8 francs. Americans will then continue to buy French goods, and if the French do not ever change their money supply via their pegged rate, the end result is their country hoarding the world’s gold like they are some dragon.\n\nIf it seems far-fetched, this is precisely what happened in history! Despite much of the world relying on the gold standard for international exchange, France refused to change the peg of their undervalued currency, and without any inflation, managed to single handedly suck up more than 1\/4 of the entire world’s gold! What are the consequences of every other country suddenly faced with a lot less money in circulation?\n\n[So here is a fairly standard supply and demand graphic for an economy](https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/laowyatt.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/How-one-makes-a-recession-happen.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1), and if you’re an economist, the only thing you may not recognize is SRS, which should really say SRAS, but shitty MS paint graphs don’t just make themselves. [Khan economy explains all of these concepts more here](https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/economics-finance-domain\/ap-macroeconomics\/ap-long-run-consequences-of-stabilization-policies\/fiscal-and-monetary-policy-actions-in-the-short-run\/v\/fiscal-and-monetary-policy-in-parallel), but I’m going to explain the image as well because my post wasn’t long enough already.\n\nLRAS means long-run aggregate supply and it is vertical because ultimately what an economy can make is bounded by its factors of production, i.e., the amount of labor, land, capital, human skills, etc. These are not ultimately determined by things like the price level or how much money is circulating in an economy.\n\nSRAS means short-run aggregate supply, and it is sloped upwards because economics is self-contradictory, this is the only supply curve that matters, and all those things that I said about the economy not being determined by prices are false because of course firms want to sell more things for more money and [don’t you know the entire field of economics is all irrelevant because of the inevitable heat death of the universe anyway?](https:\/\/dothemath.ucsd.edu\/2012\/04\/economist-meets-physicist\/)\n\nAD means aggregate demand, and you can think of it as a measure of the demand for all goods and services in an economy as expressed by the total money spent. When things cost less money, people want to buy more, hence the downwards slope.\n\nNow, when you remove a bunch of money from the economy because ~~the French~~ Ancalagon the Black is hoarding all the gold, one would see a shift in aggregate demand from ADold to ADnew. Nothing has changed with the nature of the long run economy itself, there’s still the same amount of people and things, but because there’s less money circulating, the price level is lower. I.e., there is nothing inherently changed with the overall economy, everything should just cost less. There is one small problem with that though…\n\nPEOPLE HATE TO BE PAID LESS. Good luck trying to explain to someone that actually, they should be fine taking a 5% pay cut because ~~the French~~ Smaug has stolen 10% of your village’s gold, so really, it’s not even a pay cut, but a pay raise. Even though there is nothing inherently wrong with the economy itself (such as say, a rampaging epidemic…), the end result is with employers’ hesitance to lower wages and workers’ (perfectly reasonable!) refusal to accept any lower wages, without enough cash to go around employers have to start firing people.\n\nThis was exacerbated by tremendous pressure and laws from the government such as the NIRA to not only minimize paycuts or hold wages constant, but to significantly raise wages. When the inflation rate is -10% like it was for 1932, this is a particularly horrible idea – even if you think there is a large role for the government to play by stepping in and giving people more money directly (which I happen to believe)!\n\nTherefore, not only is there this contraction in employment, but banks will also have less money (i.e. gold) in their reserves, and people start hearing about this, so they start to head to banks to withdraw their money out of a sense of caution, or perhaps they had been laid off and need to use whatever savings they have. More and more people start to do this and suddenly, an otherwise perfectly solvent bank goes bust because it does not have enough cash on hand to give to all of these people at once. Not only that, but all of the layoffs and banks going bust at around the same time causes further panic that results in a vicious cycle of them both happening with greater and greater frequency. The output gap where the economy is currently producing and where it should be producing becomes gargantuan from the mass panic, unemployment, and bank failures (this is the difference between the intersection of ADold &amp; SRAS, and ADnew &amp; SRAS).\n\nThis is why the gold standard was so horrible and why the world abandoning it or any other metallic standard to print a bunch more money was essential to recovery. As per \/u\/integralds [chart](https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/i.imgur.com\/Mc7UVjy.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1), even though they were remarkably stable at preserving long run price stability, this came at the cost of regular wild short-run price fluctuations. Those fluctuations caused multiple severe downwards deflationary pressures, which caused multiple recessions and is problematic for all of the aforementioned reasons.\n\nThis is also why economists in general are much less worried about inflation relative to deflation. A constant, stable inflationary increase in the money supply regardless of what is happening in the rest of the macroeconomy is THE key lesson learned from the Great Depression, and why it took more than a century and a pandemic for the US to return to comparable levels of unemployment.\n\nIt is also why the Federal Reserve is doing a noble job injecting unprecedented money into the American economy at the moment, and more importantly, [the origin for this glorious meme.](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/i.kym-cdn.com\/photos\/images\/original\/001\/781\/373\/b1e.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1)"}

{"question":"I am looking to load up on some stocks I think will be included before ARKX comes out, thoughts?  \n\n\nAdditionally, how are you guys going to get in? Right away? Wait and see? Like I said, I have never bought an ETF right away, but I don't see any reason I can't buy right away unless I am missing something. The price is tied to the underlining assets so it can't really get overhyped then tank like normal IPOs have lately right?   \n\n\nI am thinking of buying some RTX, NOC, LMT, LUNA, MAXR, and SPCE beforehand, thoughts?","answer":"ETFs don't IPO. They are seeded by an initial investor, usually the market maker and then they list on an exchange the next day. \n\nIt's not good to think of it as an IPO either because the concept of pricing an ETF is pretty clear and precise science. Whereas pricing a company that's never been public is more art. In that sense ETFs don't have a \"pop\" on their first day because they've been mispriced.\n\nMost ETFs I would not buy on their first day of listing. This has to do with the fact that there may not be enough shares outstanding. As a result market makers may place the market for the etf at a significant premium to it's fair value. \n\nOnce shares outstanding and volume pickup, premiums and discounts may start to fall more in line with the fair value of the fund."}

{"question":"So according to [this study](https:\/\/www.natcom.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/NCA_C-Brief_2017_March.pdf) for every 1 republican economist, there are 4.5 democrat economists.

{"question":"This is driving me crazy just from confusion. In like 90% of books and sources I read, experts say rent control creates scarcity, it does the opposite of its desired effect essentially. I’ve seen that when rent control was put into place in various cities it immediately lead to less housing development. I’ve seen that it causes landlords to not care about upkeep, it causes abandoned buildings occasionally cause they weren’t profitable, and I read it can lead to construction of more luxury buildings where rent control doesn’t apply. In that last case it seems like this system that tries to help the poor in fact helps the rich. Yet I still see politicians advocating for it and it still exists in places around the world.

The typical millennial entered the job market *at minimum* at age 22, if not older. He\/she has much less experience than a baby boomer\/Gen X at the same age, and thus a lower wage *initially*.

{"question":"Probably a very stupid question and even more philosophical than economic, but are there theories or even proof that Supply and Demand is a law that applies to nature as well?","answer":"This is a good question and a rather tricky one. We have to be careful.\n\nFirstly, I think *scarcity* is natural. People always have unmet wants. I'm sure some Anthropologists would question even this, and would say that wants are always conditioned by society. I'm sceptical of that view. In pre-history we had a world without any technology. All across the world people developed technology to do various things, which suggests that unmet wants are universal.\n\nSecondly, *optimization* is not particular to humans. Physical systems often reach some sort of equilibrium which represents an optimum in some sense. Organisms are similar. Slime moulds are often given as an example of that these days. Optimization algorithms have even been created that were inspired by how slime moulds behave.\n\nDoes this get us to where we want to go?  Does it show that supply and demand is natural in some sense?  Perhaps, but the sense is not so simple.\n\nOf course, a society doesn't have to have private property or markets. Societies that do can limit what private property and markets apply to. Notice that is two separate conditions. A society may retain private property but ban the trading of it in some cases (e.g. some traditional societies banned nobles from selling their land). Also, a society may retain markets but prevent some things becoming private property (e.g. areas of the sea can't be traded). In those cases scarcity is not dealt with by market interactions. Supply and demand does not apply. Some kind of authority decides on the distribution of scarce resources.\n\nCan we say that if there is private property and markets then supply and demand applies? Yes, but not that any particular form of competition applies. Perfect competition requires a lot more assumptions. Indeed, the normal model of monopolistic competition requires loads of assumptions too. So, we can only say a small number of fairly simple things. For example, that a marginal increase in supply will result in a marginal fall in price if all else is equal. But we can't get to more complex things like zero economic profit or optimal scale."}
{"question":"There seems to be two schools of thought when it comes to economics,\n\nAnd on Twitter I mostly follow right-wing, conservative, pro-bitcoin influencers that say we will soon enter hyperinflation as the government is printing too much money.\n\nThe US government doesn't seem to think so...\n\nCan someone explain to me HOW printing that much money won't cause super high inflation?","answer":"If the economy were operating at its potential output level, then you would be right. However, in a recession (such as this one), the economy is operating at an output level lower than its potential. This means that there are unused resources in the economy -- things are not operating efficiently.\n\nMonetary policy (manipulating the quantity of money in the economy) is a tool that is used to help correct this. In the case of a recession, increasing the money supply theoretically stimulates the economy, and helps us return to potential output. This happens because in a recession, the velocity of money is lower than usual, so the quantity theory of money (which assumes the velocity of money is constant), doesn't really apply. The quantity theory of money is where economists get the idea that generally, an increase in money supply leads to an increase in the general price level.\n\nDespite a low interest rate, people are still saving, when we want people to be consuming (putting money back into the economy). So money is being stored away as opposed to being circulated (this is what's meant by low velocity of money). \n\nFor example, you can take a look at the stats after the 2008 recession. The Federal Reserve increased the money supply in a similar way, but it didn't result in hyperinflation."}

Are you a more effective producer in your field of work or are you playing the markets as a way to get out of your day job?

Do you even care about the financial reward or is it the reward of being correct? Do you wish to reframe your approach and come back into the market? If this is the case I would encourage you to consider a monthly “allowance” to your brokerage accounts. Put it into shares of companies that you have researched and know more that you know the man in the mirror. Diversify. There’s little diversification in many daytrader’s portfolios. This is a mistake. Stop spending money on shit you don’t need. Don’t eat out, get out of your environment for a bit. Go for daily walks\/ runs, construct a routine that serves you. Go do some yoga, go meditate. Do ALL of the shit you wouldn’t normally do, rediscover who you are and what you want in life. What one does with their money and time is a reflection of what you think of yourself ultimately. Elevate yourself, stop smoking\/drinking or whatever your vice is for a bit and replace it with something that makes you uncomfortable. Don’t get stuck in the mindset of “I’ve lost 80k” and get rid of the old identity and create your self identity that you want to be. Best of luck. If you need a chit chat, feel free to message.

It does make me wonder whether it is a widely held opinion and I’m going to be judged by friends and family if I share though.","answer":"There are a lot of echo-chambery comments here basically saying “those people are all losers who don’t understand how the market works,” “they’re jealous,” etc. I don’t think being dismissive is useful because people in younger generations (millennials and below) do not have nearly as much opportunity to own their own home as their parents; prices are nuts, demand is crazy, supply is low, wages have absolutely not tracked with the growth in home values in most places, and rental prices keep increasing with some municipalities offering few or no protections for tenants. Meanwhile, landlords—like many of the commenters here—are blithely saying crap like “lol who cares they’re just stupid teenagers, just ignore them and watch your bank acct grow!” People who are not teenagers nor lazy\/stupid\/just jealous\/etc are trying their damnedest to save money for a down payment, and they feel desperate because landlords are shrinking an extremely limited supply beyond what their family needs to enrich themselves, thereby forcing prices even further up.\n\nNow, obviously, institutional landlords are responsible for way more of that than individual landlords like yourself, and there are other nuances, too. But a lot of the immediate negativity towards any landlord is genuinely because, in many places, a great deal of young people feel totally locked out of the housing market. Their parents bought their first home at 23 for $100k new, and it would behoove you to be honest that the massive upswing in housing costs in a single generation was NOT also backed up by an increase in prosperity; millennials are the first generation in America to earn less than their parents’ generation despite generally attaining higher education. I think you can and should try to sympathize—they are working harder for less and genuinely may never be able to attain home ownership. That sucks, as many people dream of owning their own home and just don’t have a realistic path to do so. So again, landlords buying up housing stocks above what they and their families actually need, then charging rents that are rising way faster than wages… many renters feel very stuck, and some feel very resentful.\n\nI’m not saying you need to put up with abuse directed towards your person. But dismissing these people as somehow not as good or smart as you is really just out-of-touch and pointlessly cruel. There are real systemic problems underlying the discontent towards landlords that will have wide-ranging impacts on a large portion of the younger generations throughout their lifetimes."}
{"question":"I am just learning economics, but wouldn’t resource scarcity (artificially created or otherwise) be another, pretty obvious cause of inflation?\n\nJust in general, I don’t fully understand peoples reverence of Friedman, his economic style seems pretty outdated to say the least. Like I said though, just learning the ropes","answer":"A real shock to aggregate supply (increasing resource scarcity, as you’d put it), results in a higher price level *only if* the money supply and velocity remain constant.  In other words, inflation need not result from a real shock if the Fed responds with appropriate contractionary monetary policy.  This is why Friedman said “inflation is always and eveywhere a monetary phenominon”:  saying “prices are rising because real output fell” is the same as saying “prices are rising because the money supply didn’t contract enough to balance out the fall in real output”, which is just a fancy way of saying “the Fed is printing too much money”."}

{"question":"My friend and I were having a debate but neither of us are experts. To me the math shows that raising the minimum wage is a part of the solution, but it got me thinking if we can lower the cost of living. What would the consequences be for both?","answer":"Yes or no, depending on what exactly you mean.\n\nIf your question is, can we lower the inflation rate by monetary policy, then yes we can. But unfortunately, wage growth will follow and real wages (wages adjusted for inflation) will be unchanged so low-income people won't be better off.\n\nBut there is policies we can implement that would lower certain costs for people.

{"question":"Hello, as it says on the tin I was curious about this issue. This may be better askhistorians material but I thought I'd try here since I couldn't find much in the search bar.\n\nThis is mainly in response to the myth (not speaking to its truth factor) that since the 50s and 60s, union membership has collapsed resulting in skyrocketing inequality. \n\nResources would be much appreciated too.","answer":"Its largely a post-WW2 downhill history followed by a bigger decline in the 70's\/80's. The US, culturally, has always been fairly anti-union; but the end of WW2 saw a lot of strikes in union-heavy manufacturing, rising anti-union and anti-communist sentiment in places of power, and the beginnings of globalization (decline in union-heavy industries and rise in lower wage industries, the ability to just pack up and leave if your employees are expensive, increased competitive forces)\n\n(1940's) The [post-WW2 strikes](https:\/\/www.nationalww2museum.org\/war\/podcasts\/best-my-ability-podcast\/episode-5-strike-wave) were largely due to wartime no-strike pledges and reduced hours, pay, and benefits \"for the war effort\" that weren't being returned now that it was over. So for that first year after the war all of the unions were striking, and some were succeeding, but they ultimately tilted public opinion towards anti-union due to the scale while businesses began lobbying Congress to make sure it didn't happen again. The result was the creation of right-to-work laws and a ban on certain kinds of strikes via the Taft-Hartley Act.\n\n(1950's) The years after the Taft-Harley Act saw significantly more government investigations into union corruption and racketeering, most notably the McClellan Committee. Capping this period off would be the Landrum-Griffin Act, which required regular secret elections in unions and increased protections for union members from  their unions. It also tried to ban Communist Party members from holding office, but that was ruled unconstitutional. The bogeymen of communism and desegregation helped keep unions from effectively spreading into the South ([see Operation Dixie](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operation_Dixie)) and left a major region of the country non-unionized. All of this meant the pre-war growth of unions was halted, with union density in the US reaching its peak at 35% in 1954. Once the growth is stopped, its not hard to chip away at the rest. A failure to get unions everywhere in the US meant the barriers to avoid unions were low. You could just pack up and move to Texas if your employees became too expensive or annoying.\n\n(1960's) The 60's were the period of public unions. Manufacturing and farming were on the decline, while state and national government jobs increased rapidly.  The public unions stayed somewhere around 30-40% density, with better density on the local compared to the national. Private unions were dying largely because their industries were dying, while public unions were doing just fine.\n\n(1970's) Massive inflation led to a call for lower taxes, deregulation, and to halt government expansion on such scale. The Fed's response of interest rate hikes also meant the dollar was more valuable, lowering exports\/increasing imports at the exact point in time where globalization was really taking hold. Electronics from Japan, automobiles from Germany, clothing from Asia; distance was no longer a problem, the dollar was expensive, and the US union sectors couldn't compete.\n\n(1980's) Businesses moved, or threatened to move, to the South or abroad; and new economic conditions meant employees were more willing to take low-paying jobs, switch to lower-wage industries, or not join unions out of fear of it hurting their job prospects. This resulted in weaker unions, who lost their stranglehold influence on the Democratic Party or whatever Pro-Union Republicans that might have saved them. The most significant capstone happened at the beginning in 1981, with Reagan firing all 11k+ federal air traffic controllers who violated the rule that no federal employee can strike. In doing so, there was a bump in private businesses just firing their striking employees instead of negotiating. While that was always an option, culturally it was uncommon to exercise it.\n\n(In summation) Once they failed to unionize the South and union-heavy industries were on the decline, competitive forces meant unions were losing power. Increased oversight and anti-union sentiment hurt this further. Then those competitive forces were put on overdrive as inflation skyrocketed, interest rates rose, and distance not being an issue meant both that foreign markets could enter and domestic industry could leave (to the South or abroad)."}

{"question":"Assuming I'm not in the USA, and in a country with no income taxes, and with monthly spendings of roughly $1000, and a monthly income of $1700, in my early 20s, how much should I theoretically invest, assuming perfect conditions, to obtain $1000 per month by the age of 30?\n\nThe calculators I'm using shows that I'm barely making any money after 10 years. Clearly I'm doing something wrong.\n\nSome guidance or links would be appreciated!","answer":"Well, to make 1,000 a month, 12,000\/year, assuming 4% dividend, you will need 300k invested. If you are 20, that means you need to invest $30k a year for 10 years assuming your portfolio will not appreciate or includes dividend reinvestment.\n\nYou will need to invest 2,500 a month to make that goal base on your timeline.

I would only buy 2 shares or so at a time. Dca in.\n\nCramer is always pumping CAT.\n\nMy other industrial plays are UNP and ODFL.\n\nI heard CAT may do well this year especially?","answer":"A ridiculously simple way to think about fair value is what will it return after inflation.\n\nA 24 p\/e is the same thing as a 1\/24 yield - for every $24 you put in, you get $1 back.\n\nSo say you put $100 in.  If CAT profits do not grow, you expect to earn a return of about $4 each year, or 4%.  If inflation is 3% then your real (after inflation) return is 1%.\n\nHmm seems like a lot of risk to take on for 1%…\n\nNow if CAT profits grow by 3% each year, well now you are making 4% after inflation, assuming they keep growing that much.  If they grow more you make more, if they grow less you make less.  Let’s say they beat average productivity and grow profits 5% per year.   Pretty good but still only a 6% real return for what is probably a 85th percentile likelihood performance.\n\nThe question for a value investor (as I define a value investor) is “what do I pay today, what will it grow, how risky is it, and is the return worth the risk of loss of principal?”\n\nI’m not a buyer of CAT because while we can expect it to grow profits at an overall productivity rate, it is a mature business, with substantial competition, and no clear path to growth beyond productivity.  There are also not insignificant risks of competition, boom\/bust cycle inefficiencies, etc.  A 1-6% real yield doesn’t seem like my best opportunity to deploy capital for my risk preference."}

{"question":"By some measures (like the PPP) China has already surpassed the American economy and with its record growth even with a pandemic it seems that China will outpace the United States even with GDP nominal. \n\nDoes the United States just accept this as inevitable? Whether yes or no, can the United States maintain its economic hegemony?","answer":"If the American economy continues along roughly as normal and the Chinese economy keeps growing at roughly its current growth rate until it converges fairly close to the frontier GDP per capita level, then China will eventually have a larger economy than the United States. China's population is about 4x that of the United States, so surpassing the US in terms of total GDP does not require their GDP per capita to even catch up all that close to the US's GDP per capita level.\n\nSaying anything more than that is hard. On the one hand, Chinese economic growth could stall out before that happens: growth rates depend on a lot of things, including government policies and political institutions. Credibly forecasting such things is probably not possible, however, and if it is, whoever is doing it probably is charging a lot of money for the forecast. On the other hand, the US could do things to affect its economic trajectory. While significantly boosting growth rates when already at the technological frontier is challenging (though, who knows, surprise economy-shaping technological breakthroughs have happened before), the US could simply take in a large number of immigrants and thereby reduce China's advantage in terms of population size (some pundits are explicitly [advocating for this](https:\/\/medium.com\/conversations-with-tyler\/matt-yglesias-tyler-cowen-economics-one-million-americans-e5d298329048)). As in the Chinese case, it probably is also true that there are no credible forecasts of what the US political system will do over the next 20 years or of whether there will be surprise, society reshaping technological breakthroughs over that same time period."}

{"question":"Hi guys,\n\nSo apparently Chinese banks are preventing people in China from withdrawing their money.\n\nMy question is why?\n\nEven if banks there lacked the liquidity, wouldn’t they be able to just inject liquidity from their central bank as they have monetary sovereignty (rely on their own currency they print at the central bank rather than an imperial currency)?\n\nThanks.\n\nNote: I’m not interested in the cop out answer of oh well they’re an authoritarian communist regime or something like that, I’d like an economic argument not a political one.","answer":"Chinese banks are not stopping people from withdrawing money. 4 small village banks in Henan: Yuzhou Xinminsheng Village Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank and New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng; have stopped people from withdrawing money under suspicion that the banks might collapse.\n\nAll of them are in the same province and have the same private majority shareholder Henan New Fortune Group. Authorities have accused the company of being run by a local gangster who is using the banks to illegally finance other private investments. Under public pressure, the government has begun reimbursing villagers many of whom held savings accounts there under promise of high interest rates and other benefits.\n\nThis reimbursement has been both slow and patchy, while communication about how it will take place has been dismal, creating significant unrest particularly given it concerns many people's life savings."}
{"question":"I've heard a lot of people say that we need to go back to gold-backed currency because fiat money \"has no real value and is just backed by men with guns\".\n\n\nBut gold has no \"real value\" either!

What advantages would it bring and why would it be better than fiat?","answer":"You are correct. The \"value\" of the dollar is determined by the supply of and demand for dollars, the same way gold's value is determined. \n\nThe one legitimate issue with fiat is that, in theory, a government may have an incentive to de-value a currency to pay for a bunch of spending. This has happened historically. \n\nBut it is not a big deal in a world where you have a trustworthy central bank, and comes with a lot of costs. If you actually cannot change your money supply, you can't create more money to stimulate a weak economy. It also exposes the money supply to the supply of gold, an arbitrary metal."}
{"question":"\nI picked these two automakers but I could have picked others.  Does the market cap ever have any sort of trend in reflecting the size of a company?  Does this market cap indicate some kind of inflated value for Tesla? Yes I know the stock price is based on the anticipated or perceived value of a company but is there any long term limitations to this huge discrepancy?","answer":"I think it's important to realize that the stock market is a secondary market and to distinguish that from the primary market.\n\nThe primary market is the initial public offering or the initial offering of stock. The company sells stock and receives money for that stock. The secondary market is all the trading that happens after the stock's initial sale -- so every stock market for the most part. \n\n\nThe company doesn't *directly* receive any money when stock is traded on the secondary market -- the company only receives money from the initial offering. So while a company has a market cap of $669b, that's not the money it has received directly from investors. (Based on [Tesla's balance sheet](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/TSLA\/balance-sheet\/), it has $6b of cash with about $4b coming from stock issuances during 2019. It's doing well and has enough cash and short term assets to service the short-term debt\/loans, so that's a good thing.)\n\nWhile that doesn't directly answer the question of what happens when the stock market value (market cap) and the actual value diverge, I think it's an important fact to understand and you could probably extrapolate a few reasons why and when those divergent values could cause problems."}
{"question":"So, I like to stay up on current events and lately Im noticing all of my feeds (especially youtube) have headlines that amount to \"China's Economy is going crash any day now!\"\n\nNow, I get the basics of the economic crsis unfolding in china, but what Im trying to understand is if the sitiation is as dire as these (mostly youtubers) make it out to be. \n\nI feel like since I am American, Im likely to see more content that has a pro-western bias to it, but the amount of content painting a dark cloud over China's economy seems too significant not to wonder if its really true. \n\nSo what say you, big brain, reddit economists? Is Chinas economy really on the verge of collapse, or is this just sensationalist clickbait that Im consuming?","answer":"YouTube videos have been calling the collapse of China for many years now, in general because of a Western power fantasy that would really like to see China collapse so it doesn't continue to pose a threat to the current world order. It's also undeniable that both sides are waging a massive and very well funded propaganda campaign against each other where they both claim the other is on the brink of economic collapse. There's a few major issues plaguing the Chinese economy - some are not as bad as you think, and some are much much worse. The Chinese economy is still by far the world's fastest growing major economy, particularly as it does not have the same problems with growth and inflation that the West is experiencing. For example, 5Y credit default swaps on China's sovereign debt are trading only around 75bps (already heightened from war fears) which is slightly higher than Iceland, while Italy is trading around 139bps. To put that into perspective, people think there is roughly a 4% probability that China defaults over the next five years, versus 9% for Italy.\n\nThe housing crisis isn't really as bad as you think. There's been a lot of doom and gloom claims that the Chinese economy is propped up by construction, and with that gone it is going to explode. We have seen little evidence of this to date. The assumption was that the banks would implode and credit supply would completely cave - which we saw in the US in 2008 and Japan in 1991. Fortunately, China's banks are all state owned, which meant that the government could just play musical chairs with the debt, reallocating weaker bank assets to stronger banks. To manage the ensuing moral hazard, it has been using its authoritarian system to arrest, fine, fire, or otherwise destroy the people running the weaker banks. The net result is that while it has always claimed this, we are now able to see that China really does have some pretty unique and extra effective ways to deal with these sort of crises.\n\nA lot of problems have actually been solved but is not widely reported in Western media. For example, a lot of YouTube videos talk about ghost cities, but that hasn't really been a thing since 2016. Ordos, the most famous ghost city has blossomed into a major city now. Pudong is now the highly prominent financial district of Shanghai. Chenggong became so overcrowded that it now has its own commuter suburbs within Kunming.\n\nTo be clear, some major problems like population decline are pretty real and well-discussed. That being said, every country other than the US is facing significant population decline; and China is not by far the worst. China's efforts to cope with population decline are very unorthodox, and involve practical things like incentives for children or school subsidies, but also very philosophical things like improving the \"holistic quality of life\" or \"common prosperity\" or \"confidence in the success of our country\". The idea that low birthrates are down to nihilistic philosophy is a very Asian concept - and is best exemplified by the South Korean concept of Hell Korea. Modern life is seen as so full of misery, inequality, corruption, and competition - that people have no desire to live in it, let alone to bring a child into the world. \n\nChina's single largest economic risk is actually geopolitical. Having become a crucial lynchpin in the world economy, it is watching the West progressively decouple from it. To Chinese geopolitical hawks, the West is trying to take the economic pain of decoupling very slowly so that when it is fully decoupled it can start attacking China without repercussions. There are those who feel that China cannot afford to wait and let that happen, but needs to threaten \/ convince the West not to decouple; or otherwise decouple right now so that the West is forced to bear the economic pain all at once."}

DASH - 23B","answer":"If we look worldwide, there are ten public auto manufacturers who are profitable. The total market cap between these ten companies is about $1.18 trillion. Here are some quick statistics: Tesla accounts for 56% of the $1.18 trillion market cap for profitable auto manufacturers. However, Tesla accounts for only 2% of the revenue and 5% of the profit.\n\nLet's take a step back and really understand what this means. I like to think in terms of buying the whole business when investing. Assuming I had 700 billion dollars to invest. I could buy tesla for $665 billion or I could buy every other profitable car company for $514 billion.  With Tesla I'm gambling on them raising revenues from their current $18.7 billion to around $184.8 billion. This ten fold increase in revenues is needed to get to a $33 billion profit or a 20 P\/E, this is assuming they are able to maintain their most recent years profit margin of 18% which is an insanely generous assumption. Once Tesla hits this number it means it will take twenty years of earnings to recoup my investment since I own the whole company. While the car market may grow, the market will not increase in size ten fold the way Tesla's revenues need to grow. Meaning a lot of those sales will have to be won from the other established manufacturers.\n\nOn the other side, I could instead pay $514 billion, $151 billion less than I would pay for Tesla, for the other 9 profitable car companies. In exchange I get $767.8 billion in annual sales and  69.6 billion in annual profits.\n\nNow let's take the two pieces of information together, do you see a clear roadmap for Tesla where they are able to get to $184 billion dollars in annual revenues? How long will it take Tesla to get there? Keep in mind once they get there it's still going to take a long time for Tesla to give you a good return on investment. If it takes ten years for Tesla to get to the point where they get to the $184 billion revenue target, it's probably not a good investment since you won't recoup your cost until well after that point. Additionally, let's assume Tesla can somehow quickly make it to $184 billion in revenues on an 18% profit margin. Why wouldn't I pay less money, $514 billion, to buy every other manufacturer with the knowledge they can get me a $70 billion dollar annual profit immediately compared to Teslas **potential** $33 billion profit? Why would I even take my time gambling with Tesla? \n\nSources: Finviz, Google Finance\n\n\\-pasted from a reply to a friend regarding them saying Tesla was undervalued"}

{"question":"Context: [https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/if-you-sell-a-house-these-days-the-buyer-might-be-a-pension-fund-11617544801](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/if-you-sell-a-house-these-days-the-buyer-might-be-a-pension-fund-11617544801)\n\nI also saw a Twitter thread about Blackrock buying most of the houses in the middle-class suburb and carrying out the \"Great Reset\". What is the Great Reset and what has it got to do with financial institutions bidding up the prices of houses that are supposed to belong to the middle-class and buying them up? What will be the long-term implications of this action?","answer":"Please don't look on twitter for anything economics related, it is almost always garbage. The great reset is just a plan by the World Economic Forum to make the 'economy more sustainable' after COVID. If anything the program is likely to be pretty hollow, but for whatever reason it has been one of the go-to topics to flock to by all storts of conspiracy theorists. Same for Blackrock itself.\n\n\nAnyway, article itself is pretty clear, I'd say. Bond yields are low and stock markets are high, so investors are looking elsewhere for returns. Low rates make borrowing cheap and thus demand for housing high, which, in combination with low rates is expected to push prices further up (at least in the short run). For institutional investors, in particular pension funds, both mortgages and rentals are interesting investments as usually pension funds have a lot of capital right now, which they only have to pay out in installments in the future. Thus, spending your capital right now on property which is likely to appreciate and can give you rent income over a long period of time is seen as a good investment.\n\n\nIf the buying up continues, we'd likely see a shift from home-owners to rentals. Personally, I find the current hoopla on housing-prices ever increasing slightly naive, but that may be a minority view even amongst commenters here."}

Now everyone's buzzing about Austin. What gives? Where did the trend in the culture come from and is the trend justified (i.e. Does Austin offer something better than anywhere else in the country? What is it?) or is it just clever real estate marketing? Were there any investors who saw the potential in Austin before it blew up, and if so, what did the early indicators look like?

I also have a sibling so of course half of the money will eventually go to them, but hey, this still maximizes the money within the family.

And so companies are focused on cutting costs and being capital efficient.\n\nAnother way to look at this, is the cost of capital is going from close to zero to 5 percent. This increases the default yield any business needs to produce to be more attractive than the risk free rate of return. Capital is becoming more scarce. And so must be managed more efficiently. And so, instead of huge RnD teams trying to break out into new market segments, companies are looking to preserve capital, allocate it for known rewards, focus on cash flow, and make less risky bets."}

So I wouldn't be surprised if this is the basis of your 42 million from journalists misreporting on this report. \n\nI would like to note two problems with this report \n\n1. Unfortunately there are always lots of people in this country who are housing insecure. One thing that this report doesn't tell us how the numbers have actually changed while speculating (and not ridiculously) on why it is probably worse now. So one part of your answer will be lots of people, 3.6 million households annually between 2010-2016, get evicted every year, so not much change in the dynamics of the housing market (this is a real problem but not in the scope of an answer to your question). \n\n2. They get that high number by including survey respondents who are \"only\" moderately confident in their ability to pay their rent, so 40 million is likely vastly overinflated versus what we should actually expect in regards to numbers of people who will be evicted in January and through the beginning of next year. \n\nSo, this 40 million number is probably vastly inflated, and, unfortunately, there are already a large number of evictions every year.  \n\nBut, anyways, to your question. What could we expect if ~15 million households are evicted in January due to the inability to pay rent, or the back rent that will come due once the moratoriums are over. This \"analysis\" is just the cold hard \"here's what happens in markets\" without taking into account any possible policies or secondary impacts. \n\n1) We will immediately have ~15 million units available for rent \n\n1a) A significant proportion of those will no longer really be able to care if you have an eviction (especially if it came in 2020 which really doesn't reflect on anyone) as long as you have a job and are therefore a decent enough credit risk going forward.\n\n1b) Some of the 15 million households may have to combine to make it so that they have enough combined income to be a decent credit risk going forward \n\n1conclusion) some large portion of the ~15million units will be almost immediately filled by the very same people who were just evicted with massive dislocation relocation costs.  \n\n2) Some portion of the units that saw and eviction will not be immediately back filled. \n\n2a) rents in these empty evicted apartments will fall due to the \"excess\" quantity supplied of rental units now on the market. \n\n2ai) as rents fall some of the evicted will now qualify as decent enough credit risks, income vs new lower rent. \n\n2aii) some people who were not evicted will now start renting them (either they were rooming with other people in a rental, or were living at home, or etc.) \n\n3) Rents across the board will fall as these new lower rent apartments that saw an eviction create more competition with other rental units that did not see an eviction. \n\n4) As rents fall that changes the calculation on purchase versus renting across the market which will lead to housing prices to fall to keep in equilibrium at the margin. \n\n\n&gt;Would landlords sell their vacant properties rather than pay the mortgage and upkeep and flood the market with homes for sale? \n\nIn the scenario above, rents initially fall, prices initially stay the same. Housing on the margin will leave the rental market and enter the owner market until prices adjust returning to equilibrium between rent vs buy. \n\n&gt;Or could there be a wave of defaults on investment properties?\n\nThere could be and also as those houses enter the for sale market prices would be expected to drop so we may even see people walk away from owner occupied mortgages. It all depends on the scale of price changes. \n\nBut, again, I think the ~15 million households \"at risk\" of eviction is a vast over estimate of what we are going to actually see in January or through the beginning of the next year. I expect we will see rents fall some amount (I am not expecting a large fall outside a few select central cities) and prices will not go up as fast as we otherwise might have expected (the big driver of increasing prices right now is the fall in interest rates). \n\nFinal Note: I am a mod here and an Urban Economics PhD (although the above is a simplified undergrad level analysis). This post has generated a lot of interest and a lot of incredibly crappy \"answers\"  that will not be approved which is why you, and everyone else peeking in, can't and won't see them. \n\n!PING URBAN"}

We are only on this planet for 80 years before we are gone forever, and all our accomplishments forgotten. A couple generations after we are gone, not even our own descendants will know who we are. \n\nSo my question is, what really are your goals in life? is having a family, good job and a home all you really want to achieve?

{"question":"In Germany its very common to rent your entire life, in the uk its very common to become a home owner. \nWhst effects does this have in the economy and wealth inequality?","answer":"This is a difficult question to answer.  I hope that \/u\/HOU_Civil_Econ knows more about it than I do.  I'll mention a few things that may be useful.\n\nAs others have said, the difference in home ownership rates between the UK and Germany are not that large (65% vs 51%).  But, as the Statista site also says, home ownership rates in some other European countries are a lot higher.\n\nHome ownership has some labour market disadvantages.  If you own a home in town X and there's a job opening in town Y then what do you do?  Do you sell your house in town X and buy one in town Y?  Or do you rent?  It's a difficult question.  Moving house is expensive.  There are large frictional costs to buying and selling property (e.g. cost of survey, cost of legal services, taxes).  As a result, people who own a home have a large incentive to stay in it.  Even if doing so results in them taking (or keeping) a lower wage job locally rather than moving elsewhere to a higher wage job.  So, home ownership can harm labour market flexibility.\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tricky issue.  Ownership gives you security of tenure.  That can be useful.  However, types of letting agreement can also give security of tenure.  There can be long-term rental agreements.  As I said elsewhere in this thread, in the long-run it is the tenant who pays for this security of tenure.  The landlord must hedge against the possibility of a bad long-term tenant, that introduces extra costs for the landlord which must be passed on to the tenants.\n\nSome say that home ownership creates better neighbourhoods.  That may be true, but I haven't seen good evidence of it.  It may just be that higher-income neighbourhoods are better neighbourhoods, and that higher-income neighbourhoods tend to be full of owner-occupiers.\n\nRental versus buying changes the political issues.  Owners of housing have an incentive to prevent development of more housing.  That's true of both owner-occupiers and landlords.  However, landlords are more clearly an interest group.  Renters have an interest in more construction.  I'm sure people have studied this difference, but I haven't read what they've found.\n\nOwnership may be useful for events like the COVID19 lockdowns.  Those who pay rent and lost their jobs were in trouble and needed government help.  Those who owned housing were in less of a sticky situation.\n\nLastly, this is one thing that makes wealth inequality statistics misleading.  A person who owns an expensive home is not necessarily better off than a person who pays a cheap rent.  High house prices can boost the wealth of sections of society.  That can increase average wealth and reduce wealth inequality.  But, does that actually mean much?  A high house price is not that important if you can't sell to realize the gain.  If all house prices are high then you can't do that."}
{"question":"In [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UNv_WuZlW1c), excerpt from his book \"intellectuals and society\" Sowell claims that income inequality is poorly measured because leftist intellectuals only look at the categories of the population and not at the people themselves. He makes the argument that people move out of their categories through their lives so the classic idea that inequality is increasing is false because we assume people remain in their income brackets. Is this measurment a correct picture of income inequality in america ?","answer":"Yes and no.\n\n\"Plain\" inequality statistics like the Gini coefficient indeed ignore factors like that. And there is something to be said for that, we know that for example people nowadays go to college more often and marry later, which means that the point at which especially household income is really going up occurs later. Which doesn't have to mean that people earn less money during their lifetime, and is a deliberate trade-off. You go to college instead of working right away to earn more money after all.\n\n*But* economists really don't miss this at all. Economists talk about things like economic mobility and intergenerational mobility to compare groups of people over their lives and how their earnings develop.\n\nTbh. Wikipedia does an alright job of giving an overview of that.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Economic_mobility\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socioeconomic_mobility_in_the_United_States\n\nBesides that, focusing on broader inequality measures *or* individual developments is kinda missing the point. Inequality isn't low just because income mobility is high or vice versa. It's not an either\/or question and both affect each other.\n\nFor example, if you're in the lowest income quintile and your income falls, that can make it harder to move up, because it's harder to for example afford to go to college.\n\nNot to mention that just the existence of inequality can have adverse effects on the economy. Doesn't necessarily matter that people move up over time.\n\nSo, basically, this is a hollow complaint, you need to look at the specific type of inequality appropriate to answer whatever you want to find out. I'm sure you can always point to some nebulous group who misses this, but economists are generally pretty good at carefully chosing their tools."}

{"question":"Several economics-related subs are chock full of people opining on the current state of inflation and other areas of stress in the economy. Many people point the finger at \"corporate greed\" and the phrase that always follows close behind: \"record profits\".\n\nBut nobody ever seems to define what \"corporate greed\" actually is, who exactly is responsible for it, or by what mechanisms it is perpetuated. Does corporate greed--as I am coming to suspect--live in the same universe as \"animal spirits,\" \"the ether,\" and \"vibes\"? Or worse, is it the kind of free-floating signifier that politicians can always pin on \"them\" so that it's easier to side with \"us\"? Or rather, is there an actual measurable and definable thing that we can point to as \"corporate greed\"?\n\nAnd if there is such a thing, what is the explanation for why it would suddenly have kicked in in a coordinated way at this particular moment, across the entire economy?","answer":"You're right that \"greed\" isn't a quantitative term used in economics texts, but it's also not without a real-world referent. It's just called profit maximization. As Fiona Scott Morton explained on [NPR's Planet Money earlier this year](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/transcripts\/1088346603):\n\n&gt;FIONA SCOTT MORTON: The corporate greed piece is - economists don't use that terminology.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;WOODS: This is Fiona Scott Morton, an economist focused on competition and antitrust at Yale University.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;SCOTT MORTON: We say that firms are maximizing profit. Now, is that the same thing? Close - it means they're going to take every dollar that they can under the law. Did the profit-maximizing behavior of firms suddenly take a jump up in 2021? I don't have any evidence that that's the case. I haven't seen anyone argue that or model that. It doesn't seem very logical to me.\n\nInstead, Scott Morton suggests there *may* be some tacit collusion (but she doesn't study this directly and has no empirical evidence):\n\n&gt;SCOTT MORTON: In a concentrated market, one firm could announce it's going to raise prices because of inflation. And its rivals might look at that and say, oh, this is a good excuse to raise prices. They're raising prices, so we should match. And we should announce we're raising prices also. We call this tacit collusion. And in a setting like this one, where inflation might be giving firms permission to raise prices and then they follow  \neach other, that could cause price increases.\n\nThis mechanism is what I see politicians and government administrators like Robert Reich referencing. But Robert Schiller, a highly-regarded economist, penned the following in a [2022 OpEd for the NYT](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/02\/08\/opinion\/dont-blame-greed-for-inflation.html):\n\n&gt;The public tends to think of inflation as an indicator of a cycle of  greed and inhumanity, as a conspiracy to rob them of their buying power. In reality, the cause is more technical, like an increase in the money  supply or disruptions in the supply chain.\n\nSo although profits are at records in certain industries with high demand (we don't hear about the ones that aren't doing well), economists understand that profit maximization hasn't changed -- rather, it's once again about money not able to reach sufficient supplies of goods and services."}

{"question":"Edit: to expand a bit, I recently read that millennials now own less than half the amount of wealth that their parents did at their age; when Baby Boomers die, is it likely that millennials will jump forward to wherever Boomers were at their age, or will the prosperity of Boomers likely be a one-time fluke?","answer":"I take it you're referring to something like [this article](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/millennials-have-just-3-of-us-wealth-boomers-at-their-age-had-21\/), which talks about how millennials have a lower share of wealth than previous generations *in percentage terms*. However, in absolute (inflation adjusted) terms, the net worth of millennials has a [similar trajectory to that of previous generations at the same age](https:\/\/ofdollarsanddata.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/per_capita_age_real_nw.jpeg).  The primary reason millennials have a lower *percentage* of overall wealth is because people are living longer.  \n\nThe parents and grandparents of boomers were far less likely to live into their 60s or 70s. So, back when boomers were young, there were fewer people in the 60+ age range and thus that segment of the population didn't have as large a share of overall wealth.  Additionally, because people didn't live as long, boomers in the 20s and 30s were more likely to have inherited assets from a deceased parent\/grandparent. Now that most people live into their 70s, that 60+ segment of the population has a higher percentage of overall wealth and millennials are less likely to have inherited from a parent\/grandparent.\n\nAnother reason younger people today tend to have a lower net worth in their 20s\/30s is because [more people go to college today](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/content\/dam\/Census\/library\/visualizations\/time-series\/demo\/fig_2.png). That means a 25-year-old today is more likely to have only been working full time for a couple years, while a boomer at 25 was likely to have been working full time for 7 years or more. The 25-year-old college grad today also probably has student loan debt, which boomers usually didn't have, even if they went to college. That is to say, younger people today enter the workforce later and are more likely to be starting off with student loan debt. But that doesn't mean that, in the long run, they will be worse off than boomers were.  Over the course of their life, a typical college grad earns [$1 million more](https:\/\/obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/page\/files\/20160718_cea_student_debt.pdf) than someone without a degree. \n\nNone of this directly answers your question of what happens to boomers' wealth when they die. That's because there's not a clear cut economist's answer to what happens to someone's wealth when they die. If they die intestate, the wealth goes where ever the law says it goes, and that varies by state.  If they have a will, the wealth goes where ever the person who died willed for it to go. Usually, the estate goes to family, but it could also go to charity or just about anywhere else.  \n\nSome of the non-approved comments suggest that estates get taxed away when a person dies. At the federal level at least, that's rarely true. Under federal law, an estate isn't taxed unless it's over $11.7 million, meaning someone would have to be in the top 1% before their estate would be taxed. If they're married, they can give the entire estate to their spouse tax free, and when the spouse dies they can combine the exemptions, meaning the estate wouldn't be taxed unless it's over $23.4 million.  Needless to say, that doesn't happen very often."}

Can you suggest me a decent bank with good credibility who doesn't loot their customers in this manner?","answer":"If you don't visit bank branches that often than I guess SBI\/Bank Of Baroda would do. Opening up an account with those can be a difficult task but once its opened up you are good to go. Only problem occurs when there's some urgency to visit branch and you witness some of the worst moments of your life. Charges are reasonable imo."}
{"question":"I’m located inside EU and work remotely for a US-based company. My current salary is 100 000 USD per year and I’m getting paid in USD.\nThey offered to pay me in EUR, specifying my new salary will be locked at 86 205 EUR per year.\nWould you take the deal or keep the USD salary?\n\n\nPros: less bank fees.\nCons: considering strategies of FED and ECB, it looks like USD will get progressively  stronger (but this is a speculation)","answer":"You spend in Euros, so you should ask to be paid in Euros. If not, you are structurally exposed to currency fluctuations and FX risk.

{"question":"I hear lots of people calling for a boycott on companies like Nestle or Apple, because those companies are often tied to child labor and inhumane working conditions in foreign countries. And obviously child labor and sweatshops are despicable, but I’ve always wondered: if these boycotts became widespread enough to start affecting the company, would they actually start treating their employees better? Or would they just like, fire them all? Do boycotts help improve the conditions of mistreated workers, or do they just lead to them being unemployed and even poorer?\n\n(This is probably the dumbest and most ignorant question ever, but I don’t take AP Macro til next year and I kinda don’t know a lot about the global supply chain)","answer":"Paul Krugman has written some interesting articles on the issue. You're exactly right: by boycotting, say garments from Bangladesh, all you're likely doing is pushing Bangladesh further into poverty. The only way these countries can offset their low productivity is through low wages. Bad working conditions are better than no work and famine.

{"question":"It's been about 12 years that I'm a client and I keep telling myself, oh maybe next year they will release a good NATIVE mobile app. \n\nNow it's 2021 and we are still forced to use a web wrapped non-native mobile app that is slow and unresponsive. \n\nAnyone else frustrated about this? \n\nAs a digital products designer, I find it incredibly disturbing that that a broker like them wouldn't invest heavily in native app development (like everyone else is doing). \n\nI hope there are some Questrade employees in this sub that can chime in to lend some insight.","answer":"I have both Qtrade and Questrade and like them both and use them for different types of investing, my #1 complaint regarding Questrade is reliability. I think they should slow down and tighten things up first (not disagreeing with your desire for a native app, but in my opinion Questrade just tries to do too much at the same time and perhaps this is the time to just take a tiny step back and clean things up). Below are my 2cents:\n\n* I want it to login and stay logged in and not just quit on me whenever it wanted to. If you look at Qtrade iOS App it will look very rudimentary and maybe even the web wrap you mentioned, but boy does it work reliably and allow me to do most of what I need to do on the phone.\n* For some reason Questrade not only has WebApp but also has a desktop native platform called IQ, I mean its spiffy looking but what's the point if the WebApp which most use is spotty and just haphazard. Now Qtrade on the other hand has a WebApp that may not look pretty but it is a gold mine of reliability (for the most part except for the COVID\/GME bonanza days which I am cutting slack for Questrade too).\n* I think simplicity with  wide resources is the key when it comes to investing and money, don't dumb it down too much but I don't want you to give me a airplane cockpit, if that's what I need then I would go to IBKR. You hear me Questrade?\n\nThankYou!"}

{"question":"E.g. Greece went bankrupt a while ago. Since the country can't just disappear like a company, is there a possibility that billionaires will eventually give out private loans or even buy the country to run it?","answer":"Historically it has actually been done before where billionaires use money to take over countries, but not with any kind of legality and not with any kind of subtle measures like private debt. Instead, they just directly paid or otherwise lobbied governments to intervene on their behalf, or just hired mercenaries to get it done. \n\nThe US government has historically been the largest perpetrator. In 1893, American businessmen hired mercenaries to overthrow the Kingdom of Hawaii and then lobbied the US government to send the US Marines to prevent the Hawaiian people from reinstating the Queen. In 1954, the United Fruit Company (which is now Dole) convinced the CIA to sponsor a coup in Guatemala to protect their banana plantations."}

By contrast, my current salary is paid in Euro and I maintain it entirely in EU-based checking\/savings accounts. I don't have significant amounts of money in my USD bank accounts, so in order to pay off these US credits cards I've had to go through the irritating process of converting euro from my European bank account to dollars (via wire transfers, TransferWise, etc.) All this to say, I am now looking for competitive EU-based credit cards that I can use instead of my US-based credit cards, but don't seem to be finding a lot of competitive cards that give points on transactions, etc. Could someone explain why the US-EU credit card markets appears to be so different AND\/OR recommend some competitive EU credit cards that can be paid off in euros?

The economy is shifting from products that we bought during the pandemic back to services. This shift complicates already strained supply lines as well. So if you’re making or selling products, things might be pretty bad. If you’re in the service sector, things (jobs) are booming more than you can handle.

{"question":"I can't wrap my head around this really. Inflation in US is 9.1% and in Eurozone, it's 8.6%. At the same time, USD has gained 20% against Euro. How does that work?","answer":"There are multiple reasons.\n\nThe USD is considered as a safe heaven and currently the recession concerns encourage people to move their money to safe heavens.\n\nThe second reason is the monetary policies inplemented by central banks. There are 3 main monetary policies which are used currently: interest rate decisions, forward guidance, quantitative easing\/tightening.\n\nThe FED increased it's interest rates to 1.75% and is expected to increase it by 100 bps in the next meeting. Meanwhile the ECB have not changed their interest rates and it's currently on 0%. These decisions have a stronger affect on short term interest rates. \n\nThe FED's forward guidance is much more hawkish. They expect several rate hikes this year. At the same time the ECB acts dovish and only expects smaller rate hikes like the 25 bps in july. And the forex markets are pricing in future rates so it's understandable that they are acting accordingly.\n\nThe FED also started it's quantitative tightening program meanwhile the ECB just continued quantitative easing. This has mainly an effect on long term interest rates due to the bond purchases\/sell-offs. A shrinking balance sheet can also reduce the money supply which would fourther appreciate the USD."}
{"question":"Let me start by saying that I think we can learn a lot from other people’s mistakes and our own. In the hopes of avoiding them in the future. This should be an interesting discussion.","answer":"Mistakes young investors make | As someone who has gone through the ups and downs of investing, when looking back, I cannot believe how reckless I was. I made all the mistakes you could think of.\n\nHere are some. If you are doing them right now, it is time to stop or reconsider. Trust me about this.\n\n1. Keep on finding the magic indicator | There is none, only a display of randomness masked behind fancy names such as MACD or RSI. You can use them as points of reference, but when it comes to investing, they won’t do you any good.\n2. Follow the markets like an addict | Ask yourself how many hours per day do you spend in front of the screen watching certain stocks go up and down. It is no doubt exciting. But think about it, what good does that do to your health and portfolio. Chances are, it lures you into making bad trades. You click the buy and sell button just for the sake of trading. This is not needed as all the information is reflected in the price. You can see them when the market is closed.\n3. Trade for the sake of trading | I know this is a cliche, but investing is 10% selecting and 90% waiting. Unlike other occupations that require you to constantly working, investing demands from you your patience. If you can find a way not to buy and sell for no reason, that is already a massive leap. By doing nothing, you are allowing your capital to work and grow. By doing something, you are preventing them from operating.\n4. Predict the future | There is nothing wrong with trying to be the next Market Wizard, it is just more amusing than productive. I could try to guess which way the market will move tomorrow, how much the SP500 will be in 12 months time or what price Apple will be trading at in a decade. But the truth is, it does not care about your prediction. The market is irrational and emotionless.\n5. Not reading | How does reading help? Well, to be a rational investor, knowledge is essential. By reading, you can learn and minimise your mistake. It gives you great comfort knowing that the SP500 has gone through two bubbles in the last 20 years and rose back up again. It reinforces your belief in long term investing, knowing that businesses that produce real goods and services will outlast any stock hype.\n\nI could go on, but five is enough and I will write more in another day. Those were my mistakes and right now, I am trying not to repeat them.

Picking up the kids or going to events I find myself constantly asked “so what do you do”. \n\nI always say “I own a company that does x”. But then I have to talk about it and honestly I don’t have any input there anymore so what I say is becoming increasingly vague and irrelevant. Also, it just bores them right off the rip as they don’t care to understand. \n\nWhat do you typically say when asked “what do you do”?\n\nI don’t want to come across arrogant or ungrateful for my situation. (I’ve also worked hard and risked a lot to get here). \n\nThanks","answer":"The first year or so I was retired, I was very squirrely about this and had all kind of different answers for different people.\n\nThen, one day, I said to myself, \"Self, you retired.

{"question":"In 1960, 7% of Americans had a bachelor's degree or higher. By 2018, the number had risen to 39% for Americans age 25-37. Do you believe a college degree becomes worth less when more people have one? Should we be encouraging fewer students to enroll in 4 year bachelors programs, and adopt a system like in France where only the top 20% of a high school class is allowed to enroll in a degree program? \n\nGeorgetown University claimed that 65% of job openings would require a college degree by 2020. Could this be a case of supply creating demand? That the abundance of college grads is causing employers to require degrees for jobs that previously didn't need one?","answer":"By in large, [college is still a good investment for the average person](https:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/medialibrary\/media\/research\/current_issues\/ci20-3.pdf). In fact, we have [evidence](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w19053.pdf) that the college wage premia is actually *increasing* over time and that the growth in demand for college educated graduates has been outpacing the supply. I'll use the United States as an example, but this should apply to any country. By artificially limiting the number of students you make your workforce less competitive and less productive and probably drive companies to hire more qualified foreign workers. \n\nAs for supply creating demand, I do not think that this is what is happening. The [fastest growing sectors in the US](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/emp\/tables\/industries-fast-grow-decline-employment.htm) tend to be ones that require a degree. The most rapidly declining sectors tend to be manufacturing ones, which traditionally have not required a degree. It seems more likely that people are reacting to a job market that is increasingly requiring a college degree and are responding by going to college."}

{"question":"I was reading Yuval Noah Harari's book *Sapiens*, and on page 136, he says, \"...it's a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.\"  There is no specific citation for this in the book, and it caught my eye because I had read that Thomas J. Stanley's book, *The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy,* said that [only 20% of millionaires inherited their riches.](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/0810\/7-millionaire-myths.aspx)\n\nI'm guessing that perhaps Harari is going off the Georgetown study that said [to succeed in America, it’s better to be born rich than smart](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/05\/29\/study-to-succeed-in-america-its-better-to-be-born-rich-than-smart.html) or talented?\n\nWould you say Harari's quote is true?  And is it inconsistent with Stanley's contention?","answer":"Yeah i would say Harari's assertion is more likely saying wealth breeds wealth, whereas Stanley book is more technically  correct, that most millionaires are first time, self made . \n\nIt's not that surprising when you think about it, there's a lot more people today 350million in usa,  with a lot more ways to get rich and frankly a million dollars today isn't really that much it's like $65k in 1930 dollars.  About the top 5% of US population is millionaires that's around 18 million people, if you go to something like Wolfram Alpha you might be able to derive statistically via a regression what percentage of millionaires are self made."}
{"question":"Hi guys\n\nTrading apps are everywhere, crypto is being sold all over the gaff, what is going on?\n\nThere is a massive push for the average person to start investing atm, why?

I’m guessing it means businesses can grow, but if anyone could point out why there is such encouragement to invest at the moment would be really really helpful.\n\nThanks guys","answer":"Well... the only kind of pushing which reaches outside the bubble that everyone who reads \/r\/UKInvesting is already in is the over-aggressive crypto-hype. Which is quite worrying as its suckering in a lot of naive money into a world they don't understand.\n\nRegular boring investing isn't pushed anywhere near enough, its like a giant secret that's hiding in plain sight.

They literally have no clue what to do next.\n\nYou say the word \"investing\" to most non-investors. 10% will think crypto, 90% will think Buy-to-Let.\n\nIt's absolutely crazy to me.

{"question":"I have always been wondering why nordic countries like Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark are so economically successful. I know they have a lot of state owned companies, but other countries like the UK, France, Austria did have high spending too before the 80s, but they were not so successful, actually UK's economy was kind of a disaster in the 70s. So what are Nordic countries doing different that they are doing so well?","answer":"Presuming you mean \"Why do they have such good economic growth despite such a big government?\", a former professor of mine, Stephen Gordon from Université Laval, has a series on optimal taxation which covers that topic. \n\nThe short answer is that [Nordic countries have been better than most at sticking close to what the optimal taxation literature would advocate for](https:\/\/worthwhile.typepad.com\/worthwhile_canadian_initi\/2007\/06\/doing-it-by-the.html). They have [moderate corporate taxes](https:\/\/worthwhile.typepad.com\/worthwhile_canadian_initi\/2005\/11\/who_pays_corpor.html), [high consumption taxes](https:\/\/worthwhile.typepad.com\/worthwhile_canadian_initi\/2009\/03\/why-the-gst-is-a-good-idea.html), and avoid going too far on income taxation. \n\nThe surprising fact is that it's, overall, a really regressive tax mix. That's because [they do most of their redistribution with spending](https:\/\/worthwhile.typepad.com\/worthwhile_canadian_initi\/2011\/09\/gini.html), not with taxation. The United States have actually [the most progressive taxes in the OECD](https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/ser\/article-abstract\/7\/3\/431\/1688244?login=false).\n\nFor a more thorough exploration of this question, you could look into Peter Lindert's *[Growing Public](https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/Growing-Public-Spending-Economic-Eighteenth\/dp\/0521529166)*."}
{"question":"I'm a dummy when it comes to economics. This is just a question that popped up in my head, maybe this is the right place to ask.\n\nGrateful for answers and clarification.","answer":"The media gives a flawed idea of wealth. Most very rich people don’t have $100 billion sitting in a bank account somewhere. They accumulate wealth through the appreciation of assets. Nowadays, those assets are usually shares of publicly traded companies. Wealthy people can use those shares as collateral to get loans to buy the stuff that they want or they sell off a few shares for pocket money. The reason why they accumulate that much wealth is that they physically can’t spend it. Take Jeff bezos for example. He can’t sell off all his Amazon shares overnight because that will cause the stock price to tank and reduce his wealth. So he needs to periodically sell off shares at a rate that doesn’t impact the stock price."}
{"question":" I have a very simple question. Rather than the new memestock or the ETF with a cool name, which sectors of the economy do you think will outperform the Dow Jones or S&amp;P500 in 2021, and why? \n\nI have been lurking this subreddit for a while now, and everyday I read a new ETF or stock recommendation. But there are thousands of them, some of them quite risky and dubious. And as someone else said, sometimes investment advise appears more to be a fad. Yet, I have found some of the analysis in reddit quite analytical, well informed and very well thought.\n\nProbably this thread will be ignored and disappear into oblivion, but it is worth a try as it will better guide investment decisions, particularly to new investors, and which ETF’s to invest in.","answer":"I think newer investors should stick to broad market funds till they get their feet wet and see how much volatility they can handle. With that being said, I think FinTech will continue to have strong performance this year and possibly the next few years. I think Covid has paved a way for FinTech companies to grow at a pace that FAANG did at the peak of the bull run. \n\nI like the idea of IPAY (mobile payments) but hate the expense ratio at .75. A newer fund is TPAY and from my research it invests in the companies creating the infrastructure for mobile payments and it has a .4 expense ratio. Lastly there’s FINX; it has performed well since inception (almost 200% in just under 5 years) but again with an expense ratio of .68 it turns me off."}
{"question":"Because he is just wrong.  Nothing has intrinsic value.  Value is subjective and marginal.

How sad.","answer":"You need to listen to Ron Paul more than from a 20 second talk in the Colbert Report.\n\nWhat Ron Paul supports is competing currencies, which is another way to eventually support free market in money.\n\nBy 'intrinsic value', most gold standard proponent mean that gold has a non-monetary base of value, as opposed to paper money. \n\nThey don't mean that its value is objective vs subjective."}

{"question":"With all this fear going around about privatization, I am wondering how bad it will really get. Will we see a full US style system eventually? How will privatization affect other parts of the economy? Will taxes go down? Will employers start offering health insurance? Etc.","answer":"There’s only one place where private insurance works and that’s Switzerland. It works because it’s heavily regulated by the government.  Which our healthcare used to be. \n\nSwiss and Dutch residents are required to purchase insurance from private firms in a regulated (but competitive) market. Health-care expenditures are mostly financed through a combination of community-rated premium charges (paid by residents to insurers) as well as payroll taxes. Residents who do not actively purchase insurance are either automatically assigned an insurer (in Switzerland) or charged a penalty (in the Netherlands). The primary role of government in both countries is to manage competition, regulate insurers to ensure universal access regardless of pre-existing conditions, and help define the basic benefits package. The government also provides subsidies for individuals who cannot afford their premiums. However, in order to ensure responsible and sustainable use, cost sharing in the form of co-insurance (mostly in Switzerland) and deductibles (in both) are a common feature of these universal health-care systems.\n\nWe can’t get get the government to regulate cell phone costs and pay the most in the world and you think they will regulate healthcare when there’s billions to be made?"}

Bill Gates became the wealthiest person in [1992](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/rachelsandler\/2021\/10\/05\/for-first-time-in-30-years-bill-gates-isnt-the-no-1-or-no-2-richest-person-in-america\/?sh=2124d84777e3).

While things changed [rapidly](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/1997\/07\/19\/imbos.html?sh=1819cbf55615), the lesson is that the value (often) is in the promise, not just the result.

When you get out matters, and Musk got out at a much higher price. Last, in 1992, MSFT's net income was [708M](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/investor\/reports\/ar96\/fh.htm) (equal to 1.5B today), while Tesla's net income was over [8B](https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/stocks\/charts\/TSLA\/tesla\/net-income).\n\n\n\n&gt; Jeff Bezos gained his wealth because his e-commerce business is widely used worldwide\n\nBezos became the wealthiest person in [2018](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeff_Bezos#:~:text=His%20wealth%20surpassed%20%24100%20billion,net%20worth%20of%20%24112%20billion.), when AMZN had a net income of ~[10B](https:\/\/dazeinfo.com\/2019\/11\/06\/amazon-net-income-by-year-graphfarm\/). Bezos at the time owned [16%](https:\/\/money.com\/jeff-bezos-net-worth-amazon-2018\/). Tesla's numbers really aren't that peculiar.\n\nI don't think it is necessary to elaborate on the others.\n\n&gt; SpaceX products and services are not as widely used as those of Microsoft, Amazon or Google\n\nFirst, his wealth is (obviously) for both stakes, so that is irrelevant. Second, his stakes are much larger than the billionares from those companies, especially Gates, who owns only a minute stake in MSFT. So how widely used MSFT Second, the promise of the product (and the profits) matter more than just how widely it is used.\n\n&gt; Tesla comprises less than 1% of the market share of automobiles worldwide\n\n\nThey own more than 1% of total car sales [1](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/502208\/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries\/), [2](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/200002\/international-car-sales-since-1990\/#:~:text=Worldwide%20car%20sales%20grew%20to,63.8%20million%20units%20in%202020.). Also, microsoft are likely responsible for a percents in electronics or software sales. Investors aren't considering the car market as a whole, but the EV market, in which Tesla is [big](https:\/\/interestingengineering.com\/tesla-ev-market-75-percent-market-share#:~:text=The%20company%20is%20also%20dealing,share%20of%2011%2C28%20percent.), especially in the US. If Tesla is able to keep a similar market share as the market increases, that can be very profitable. The size of the market therein is more important than just the share. If the market increases 10x, and Tesla's share halves, they will still make much more profit. Just as a 22% market share of DOS, the booming PC market, and future releases in which investors believed caused Gates to be the wealthiest man. Only with the benefit of hindsight you get to say that in those cases they were actually right and this time you do not believe them.\n\n&gt; Elon Musk's other promises such as Hyperloop have been nothing but hot air\n\nFirst, this is just an opinion, and others may disagree with you when it comes to future versions of the hyperloop. Second, remember [microsoft's](https:\/\/www.kiplinger.com\/slideshow\/investing\/t057-s001-microsoft-s-15-biggest-flops-of-all-time\/index.html) Kin, Cortana speaker, and Zune? Or [Google's](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/google-biggest-product-flops-2018-11?r=US&amp;IR=T#14-google-offers-1) Web accelerator, Jaiku, Plus, Lively, Knol, Glasses, and Nexus Q? You are just looking at the successes these companies have had and disregarding their failures. I'm not sure why one failure by Tesla or SpaceX would then disqualify them from being a success.\n\nThe point is not, by the way, whether I agree with the valuation. As long as sufficient believe Tesla\/SpaceX to be disruptors, the value is warranted. Whether they turn out to be so is irrelevant and ironically not just based on the value of the proposition -- they can turn out to be either lucky or unlucky to."}

The problem is that there are also misleading channels and, if you don’t already know economics, it’s hard to tell which are saying correct things and which are saying things that sound correct but are not. \n\nYou may also want to ask for references about specific fields.

{"question":"If the Government in March of 2020 passed a $7.6T package that gave everyone adult making under 100K per year $2400 for 21 months and did nothing else related to the economy would we have averted this massive economic disaster since the local and state governments would of had to spend money on unemployment?","answer":"Averted? No. A downturn still would have happened as a result of COVID &amp; pandemic restrictions.\n\nWould it not have been as severe? Yes.\n\nExactly how much better would the economy have fared? We could debate all day and likely never be sure.\n\nFirst thing to emphasize: the economy is not money.  Giving a person $2000 is not the same as that person working and getting paid $2000.  Even if the amount of money is the same, what the person does with it will be different.  \n\nThe cause of the economic downturn was the abrupt reduction in people doing things. I wanted to watch a movie in a theatre, but the theatre was closed so I stayed home instead. It's not the price of the movie ticket the economy loses, it's the value I place on my experience. I had to trade something I preferred (going to a theatre) with something I valued less (staying home). That's the loss; not the price of the movie ticket. It doesn't matter if the government gave me $2000 or not, with the risk of a communicable disease high I'm avoiding this activity.  It's not driven by monetary restrictions, so providing additional money won't alleviate it.\n\nThe above example is a small scale one and almost trivial in nature, but as that happens for multiple people repeatedly it adds up. Maybe my neighbor wanted to take a beach vacation, but instead stayed home and learned how to knit. Someone else wanted to go out for dinner at a restaurant but instead stayed home and cooked. Repeat these tradeoffs over and over and it adds up to the economy (which is us) being at a less desired state than we would have been absent COVID.  \n\nA large part of this compounds because of how these decisions then impacted certain groups of people.  Retail, hospitality, and service workers suddenly faced a massive downturn in their industry. This means their income fell, and as a result they made other choices not directly related to COVID.  A hotel manager decides not to buy a new car not out of fear of a pandemic, but because of reduced income. \n\nThis is where the government transfers can help. Anyone losing their job would otherwise reduce their spending (often drastically), but if they knew there is unemployment insurance available, or (as you ask) a direct transfer payment some of these decisions change and maybe the unemployed person still spends a roughly equivalent amount.\n\nThe other thing the payments would do is increase spending from people less effected by the pandemic.  Many people retained their jobs during the pandemic, they'd now have even more disposable income. At least some of this would be spent on things these people otherwise would not have purchased. But here is where determining how much more people will spend starts to matter...  In aggregate, across all people, how much of this money will be spent immediately, and how much will be saved for later?  Spending drives the immediate short-term GDP.  Savings *kind of* becomes investments, and drives long-term GDP.  But... with the fed offering historically low interest rates, the relationship between savings and investment is skewed. With historically low interest rates, financing can facilitate investments without the need for as much savings.\n\nSo, we have a picture of opposing influences of varying degrees.  People's behavior changed to avoid the virus. Just giving people cash encourages them to spend more; but still in a manner influenced by pandemic risks."}

The average northern\/western European works about [400 hours less per year](https:\/\/data.oecd.org\/emp\/hours-worked.htm) than the average American.

This isn't including the one year+ maternity and paternity leave, so they get a ton. Many Europeans also opt for thirty two hour work weeks to spread their vacation days around. The money to fund all these benefits has to come from somewhere, and this is usually in the form of lower wages and higher taxes.\n\nThe wages in Singapore are low because they import workers from nearby developing nations for cheap labor, which is why their housing is so inexpensive.

{"question":"Labor is a cost of doing business as much is rent or raw materials. Why is it so \"easy\" for prices to rise, but not for wages?\n\nMost arguments I hear don't sound logical to me. For example, someone said that if wages rose along inflation, then prices would have to increase because people were paid more (hyperinflation). However, why can't that argument be applied to literally every other product or service? A firm dedicating an additional $1M to it's yearly payroll is putting 1$M more cash into the economy as much as it would if it paid $1M a year more in rent or gas.","answer":"They do.\n\nFor most people most of the time, real wage growth is positive (real means adjusted for inflation).

{"question":"Please no political debate.  I'm just curious from an economic standpoint how these businesses stay around yet I see plenty of other companies (small to large enterprise) not surviving 2020.","answer":"The simple answer for Trump based on recent reporting: loans.\n\nThe longer general answer: access to capital.\n\nIf a business is unable to pay its bills from its revenue, then the business needs to seek capital from somewhere else. This will typically come in the form of loans, bonds, selling of property, etc. This monetary injection is then used to pay bills until the business can find its footing and get past the rough times. Big businesses tend to have more access to capital and thus have more options at their disposal for navigating turbulent economic water.\n\nYou're seeing many businesses fail in covid19 times because nobody wants to give loans to companies in hospitality, tourism, transportation, restaurants, and most service sectors. As a lender, you're looking at projections of potentially 1+ year(s) before those industries can really begin the long process of recovery. Any loan to that kind of business is very likely to go unpaid and be a loss. This is why you see these same industries frequently discussed when it comes to publicly provided stimulus packages because private lenders are unlikely to offer any help here. \n\nThe recent NYT reporting on Trump's tax returns suggest that Trump relies to some degree on private loans to keep his various businesses afloat. There's a cycle of boom, bust, loans, repeat in Trump's financials. To date, Trump has been successful in securing loans as needed to cover his losses long enough to find a new income source."}

{"question":"Im far from an economic person so hence why Im asking question's here.

That would be a big incentive to wait, not spend.\n\nNow, mild and stable deflation, or inflation for that matter, doesn't really do much, it gets priced in, interest rates, wages, etc. adapt and it's neither here nor there.\n\n*But* what happens if a recession hits? You have $10 and they will be worth $13 a year from now, but now you're also uncertain if you'll keep your job and income. So you're more conservative with your money.

{"question":"We've seen a lot of discussion lately about the impact on employment from an increased minimum wage, but are there any other potential negative effects? Are there winners and losers, or is it just beneficial all around?","answer":"I'm going to assume you've followed those discussions and have read the [minwage faq](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_minwage) - and thus sort of understand the concept of monopsony power. \n\nClearly, a firm will only hire an individual as long as the marginal product of labour ≥ the wage costs. In a competitive environment, these should be equal. As a result, your wage should be equal to your contribution. \n\n\nIf this is the case at the current minimum wage, and we raise it, there is only one logical result - the firm would hire fewer people. Some people are namely costing them more than they are earning them.\n\n\nIf there are little to none negative employment effects, the conclusion follows that employees indeed were paid below their marginal product, and there was monopsonistic power. Monopsonistic power results in (above market) profits for the firm. Those will thus be lowered as the labour costs increase.\n\n\nEdit: let it be noted that I am reasoning for a case in which employment is not (or barely) affected. Clearly, if employment *is* affected, the losses are shared by both workers and employers. In that case there was no monopsony power. Plus, this is a continium - if the minwage = $10 p\/h, and a workers' productivity = $12 p\/h -&gt; a raise to $12 p\/h has no effect on employment (loss for company, win for worker), if we raise to $13 p\/h (resulting in a loss for company, win for workers who stay employed, loss for workers who become unemployed) the effects for workers as a group is ambigious and the total surplus is not maximized anymore.

{"question":"From what I understand, working conditions such as work-life balance will be better for labor in a labor market where the supply of labor is low compared to the demand for labor. Meaning they are in-demand. Therefore you see better work conditions for engineers and IT people who have a higher skillset. \n\nDoctors and nurses clearly have a very high skillset. There is a large barrier to entry: you need to study for years and years and you need to have a very high talent in order to become a doctor or nurse. Not many people can become one. The occupation is held in high regard in society as well. There is a shortage of doctors and nurses all over the world and therefore you see these occupations in the immigration list. \n\nSo why do they have such a horrible work-life balance and work-life conditions? Shouldn't market forces mean that they would be able to bargain for and get the best work-life balance out of all the occupations there is in an economy?","answer":"I challenge your claim that working hours are lower for high earners. For example, have a look at this paper: https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w11895.\n\n&gt; According to Census and CPS data, the share of employed American men regularly working more than 48 hours per week is higher today than it was 25 years ago. Using CPS data from 1979 to 2006, we show that this increase was greatest among highly educated, highly-paid, and older men, was concentrated in the 1980s, and was largely confined to workers paid on a salaried basis. We rule out a number of possible explanations of these changes, including changes in measurement, composition effects, and internet-facilitated work from home. Among salaried men, increases in long work hours were greatest in detailed occupations and industries with larger increases in residual wage inequality and slowly-growing real compensation at 'standard' (40) hours.\n\nIn general, the higher your hourly wage, the longer hours you are working nowadays. This holds up all the way to the CEO level at the largest multinationals. See this paper for more details: https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w6504.\n\n&gt; I investigate how the relationship between the wage and the length of the work day has changed since the 1890s among prime-aged men and women. I find that across wage deciles deciles, and within industry and occupation groups the most highly paid worked fewer hours than the lowest paid in the 1890s, but that by 1973 differences in hours worked were small and by 1991 the highest paid worked the longest day. Changing labor supply elasticities explain the compression in the distribution of the length of the work day. In the 1890s the labor supply curve was strongly backwards bending, perhaps because men preferred to smooth hours over their work lives rather than bunch them as they do today. In fact, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution was slightly negative in the 1890s, but by 1973 was positive. I show that the unequal distribution of work hours in the past equalized income, but that between 1973 and 1991 it magnified weekly earnings inequality, accounting for 26 percent of earnings inequality between the top and bottom declines among men, more than all of the earnings inequality among women, and 17 percent of the increase in total household earnings inequality among husband and wife households."}
{"question":"What are some major questions that the most respected economists are working on today? Is there any issue that has two \"evenly matched\" sides and no true consensus yet?","answer":"Here's one of some interest: what is the effect of pre-k on children's short, medium, and long run educational outcomes? \n\nVery well done studies exist to support the view that the effect of pre-k is large and positive: the kids go to pre-k, they get a jump on school and develop social skills and such, they do well in elementary school, they then do well in middle school, they then do well in high school, they then do well in the rest of their life, and then eventually the kids' kids do well also. A good example of evidence pointing in this direction would be the Heckman evaluations of the Perry Preschool problem. \n\nOther well done studies exist to support the view that the effect is anywhere from \"small short run gains, which disappear by middle school\" to \"no effect whatsoever\" to \"actually, pre-k hurts the kids and leads to worse educational outcomes\" to \"pre-k seems to help a lot on a bunch of health outcomes, but maybe that wasn't the pre-k per se so much as the food and medical care that this pre-k program happened to provide\".\n\nWhy is there this variation? \n\nA lot of it is that pre-k programs often differ a lot. Some of the apparently more effective ones are quite well run, targeted children form the poorest families, and have a lot of well qualified stats. Some of the state run ones are also very well run, others less so. Head Start programs, meanwhile, vary immensely in terms of just exactly what the do. What is the formula for getting a working, effective pre-k program? We need to figure that out. Is there a formula for an effective pre-k program that we can scale up to provide everywhere in the country? Also still an open question. \n\nThere is considerably more to this question still. Part of the issue seems to be that the impact of pre-k programs varies by family income -- it seems that pre-k programs often do not outperform whatever well off families were doing anyway. Sorting this out better, however, would be useful."}

Indeed, much-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages \"do,\" in fact, reduce employment, but that the effects are small and swamped by other forces.\n\ntl;dr: maybe there will be some small negative effects and maybe some small positive effects."}

If you widen your approach, [538 has a good project](https:\/\/projects.fivethirtyeight.com\/p-hacking\/) you can play around with showing how you can easily make a case either way just depending on what politicians you include (President, Representatives, Senators, and Governors) and what economic metrics you study.\n\nAdditionally, it needs to be noted that it can take years or even decades for the full consequences of economic policies to play out--so results \"under\" one party could quite easily be partially attributable to members of the other party in power at some point earlier."}
{"question":"I'm a single man in my late 20s making 140k + super as a software developer. I can safely say I am extremely comfortable and privileged with my status in life.\n\nI don't need to go the extra mile to save money with a hospital cover. Furthermore I would rather my money go into Medicare and public sector (aka helping real people) than line the pockets of some health insurance executive.\n\nI explained this to some of my friends and they thought I was insane for thinking like this. Is there anyone else in a similar situation? Or is everyone above the threshold on private healthcare?","answer":"If the medicare levy surcharge specifically went into the medicare\/healthcare system, then I would completely agree.\n\nBut as it stands, that's not the case.\n\nYour $1400 medicare levy does not result in an extra $1400 in the public health system.\n\nWhereas your $1000 hospital cover allows you to use the private hospitals, which takes pressure off the public health system.\n\nTbh, I could understand people that argue it either way and think it's just up to you personally. I guess I'm on the fence haha"}
{"question":"Title says it all. Belarus has 25.2 Gini coefficient according to the World bank. This is better than Norway Belgium Finland and more. How could this be possible","answer":"Income doesn't really matter for the gini coefficient - only how equally it's distributed. The private sector is relatively small in the country, and the public sector wages are highly regulated, meaning the wages of most people sit within a relatively smaller range than in most European countries. \n\nDictatorships lead to cronyism and that can boost inequality, but if the circle of elites is relatively small, then this is unklikely to shift the gini coefficient much."}
{"question":"I have been putting away money into the stock market for the last year and a half and so far I've been pretty happy with the results. I was thinking about getting into crypto as well a year ago and was told it isn't a good idea and it's all speculation and is a trend that will die off. What are your guys thoughts? I never pulled the pin, but I'd also kick myself in the ass if I never got into it and made money. Ben Felix on YouTube flat out said he will not put his money into crypto.","answer":"Well, it is about risk tolerance. The best way to get rich is to go all-in in one asset... it's also the quickest way to get poor. I wouldn't go all-in on one cryptocurrency, but if you look at bitcoin, it did survive (and one could say, thrive) since 2009. It survived many adverse events, and one interesting metric is that it's 200 weekly EMA was never negative - meaning that someone buying BTC never lost money if they held for 4 years.\n\nBut could it crash, and crash hard? Yeah it could. Could it go to zero? Yes it could. As the old investor adage says, \"Don't invest in things you don't understand\". If you read on BTC and feel confortable in the technology and that it's going to stick around, put whatever amount you feel comfortable, and if past returns are indicative of future returns (which any financial advisor is obligated to tell you, isn't always the case), if you are ready to hold for four years you could have some profit in your pocket.\n\nSo yeah, it all depends on risk tolerance and asset allocation. Good luck and DYOR."}

{"question":"I'm looking to buy a term insurance plan. On policybazar, they have this option of paying the premium throughout the term or for a limited duration and still have full term coverage. The latter would mean higher annual premiums but since I would pay for a limited duration, overall I end up paying less.\n\nFor instance, a 2 CR cover for the next 40 years can be bought for a total premium of 9 lakhs over 40 years or 5 lakhs over 10 years, and the covered term would be the same (i.e. 40 years).\n\nThe main difference is instead of paying 22k per year, I'd be paying 51k per year. But these payments would stop in 10 years. \n\nHas anyone here considered\/taken this option? Do you see any disadvantages to this over the conventional annual premiums? I'm okay paying a bit more upfront if it means I pay roughly half overall.","answer":"No, this is in no way advantageous to you.\n\nHowever, it's a great thing for the insurer, as they get paid upfront.\n\nMost common tactics employed by insurers and banks, heavily rely on the fact that common men lack perception of _time value of money_.\n\n----\n\n### Opportunity Cost\n\nThis deal is presented to you as _you pay less over the years_.\n\nBut in reality, you actually pay more.\n\nFor most term insurers, the problem is people surrendering their policies after 5-10 years of enrolling in it. This is a good thing!\n\nInsurance is supposed to act as an umbrella while you build a roof over your head. It's possible that within few years of taking the insurance cover, your net worth exceeds the cover amount. \n\nAt that point, paying premium on that insurance is pointless - in the event of your demise, your nominees can simply inherit your assets, no need to go through an insurance claim process.\n\nIn the meantime, insurance company loses a paying customer.\n\nSo how to mitigate against this? Enter new gimmick - pay more upfront over smaller duration of time.\n\nThe insurer bets that paying 5L over 10 years, can have equal or even better ROI; than paying 9L over 40 years.\n\nAssume Nifty TRI returns are 8% p.a. for long term. Then, an SIP of 50k \/ year, for 10 years, would be ~7.7L at the end of 10th year. And this 7.7L corpus would be ~77.48L in amount, in another 30 years. No inflation-adjustments were done.\n\nNow, an SIP of total 9L in amount (22.5k \/ year) spread over 40 years, at 8% p.a., becomes only 65L!\n\nReverse the situation.\n\nYou've an opportunity cost:\n\n- if you take the 5L over 10 years plan, you lose the opportunity to turn that into 77.5L over 40 years\n- if you take the 9L over 40 years plan, you lose the opportunity to turn that into 65L\n\nWhich one would you rather take?\n\nThe second one also give you the option to have less _sunk cost_ 10-15 years down the line.\n\n----\n\n### Another perspective\n\nYou could also think of it as every passing year, due to inflation, you're paying less in value to the insurer.\n\nThe premium remains fixed at 22.5k \/ year. That changes in value, as more time passes.\n\nAssume long term inflation (not talking about CPI, the inflation that actually applies to you), is ~8% p.a.\n\nThen after 10th year, you're effectively paying 10.42k \/ year in today's value\n\nAfter 20th year, you're effectively paying 4.82k \/ year in today's value\n\nAfter 30th year, you're effectively paying 2.23k \/ year in today's value\n\nAt the 40th year, your last premium, would be 1.03k in today's value\n\nAnd you always have the option to opt out with peace of mind, when your net worth crosses 2 Cr.\n\n---\n\n\nEDIT: some of you've reached out to me and asked why is this not on the [free, open-source wiki](https:\/\/www.indiainvestments.wiki).

{"question":"I thought that inflation generally degrades a currency.\n\nIs it because all other competing currencies are handling inflation more poorly than the USD?\n\nAnd what would be the causes that would lead to a weakening dollar?","answer":"A major factor in exchange rates is interest rates. For an oversimplified example, if I can put my money in a U.S. bank and earn 5% interest, or a European bank and earn 1% interest, I will be willing to pay a higher premium to hold my money in US dollars. The U.S. is currently raising its interest rates faster than many other developed countries. Also, for the euro specifically, Europe is seen as being at greater risk of destabilization from the conflict in Ukraine because they are dependent on Russian oil and gas, and because they share a landmass with Russia. Finally, the US dollar still benefits from a perception of it being a stable and universal reserve currency, so in times of crisis or instability, it tends to fare better than other currencies."}

You call your broker, usually at the bank, ask for a quote and submit the order you'd like to buy if it was close to the price you wanted. Some people still put in limit orders and things like that, but most people just put in an at-the-market order when the price was near what they believed reasonable. Schwab pioneered the \"discount brokerage\" back in the 70's when deregulation came along for the industry. Before this it was even pricier to get in and out of equities.\n\nIf you wanted information on a company, you didn't go to [SEC.gov](https:\/\/SEC.gov) and there was no such thing as a \"stock screener\" database for the everyday person to access. There was the ValueLine Investment Survey, which you could buy a subscription to, and the Wall Street Journal, for which you could also buy a subscription. If these two gold mines didn't have the information you needed, you got out a pen and paper and you wrote the company, requesting the Annual Reports desired. If you were lucky, the mail room delivered your request.\n\nBecause it typically cost the higher end of that, or $20, to make a trade, people didn't dick around buying 2 share of some $40 stock. Who wants to pay a 25% front-load fee?\n\nThen Al Gore invented the internet, alongside some nobody named Tim Berners-Lee, and maniacs like Jeff Amazon and Tim Apple were unleashed building the modern web and smart phones, and apps for smart phones. Sites like eTrade, Scott trade, etc. began offering web-based trading for retail traders, usually at $5 per trade. Now you could check your account anytime, and submit trades without calling a broker, all the while having a Yahoo chat &amp; refreshing their favorite Yahoo Groups! message board with their fellow cutting edge trading e-friends.\n\nIn the mid aughts, Tim Apple's predecessor Steven P. Jobs the 12th single-handedly invented the iPhone. It's a common myth that Apple had a lot of engineers behind the scenes. That's a lie. It was only Steven. That's why he's always on-stage alone, there was nobody else.\n\nThe rest is recent history, and now anybody with a smart phone can swipe stocks and order options easier than ordering a new pair of slacks from JC Penney's catalog in the 90's.\n\nPeople didn't degenerate. History has plenty of degenerate gamblers. The casino just became more convenient. Now we can carry it around in our pockets."}
{"question":"I’m a EMT &amp; and my SO is as well. I just can’t picture how a couple can afford to buy multiple homes and turn them all into rentals, making profit while paying the mortgage.","answer":"When I was a kid I had a neighbor who was a metro city bus driver. His wife had a hair salon in the back of their house. My neighbor used equity from his home for a down-payment on his second property.  He repeatedly used equity from his other homes to buy more homes.  He did this for 30 years.  I ran into him after he had retired from the metro city bus driver job. He told me he had acquired 33 properties in those 30 years.  He had just finished paying them all off when he retired. His properties are worth approximately $3 million. His monthly rentals brought in approximately $45K per month when we last spoke. When he bought them way back in the late 70s through early 80s those properties cost about $25K-$35K. He had an account at the metro city bus credit union.  Credit unions are very helpful to members. I'm sure his stable and secure city job made it easy to get the loans on those properties. Anyway,  that's how my neighbor did it. He's now a millionaire. He's also 70 years old now. So it does take time to do it that way."}

It seems to be the most common elsewhere but here it's only CFD's \/ Spread Betting. Is there any UK brokers that allow calls\/puts?","answer":"This is an old guide thats been deleted bit i saved it before. NOT MADE BY ME\n\nThis is guide to US options trading from the UK, because I've seen countless requests of people browsing in \/r\/ukinvesting, \/r\/options, \/r\/wallstreetbets etc. about this.\nFirst thing's first - no part of this post is to be taken as financial advice. It is a guide on how to start options trading from the UK. Options\/CFD trading is a high-risk activity and most retail traders lose money.\n1. CFDs vs. Options\nSo getting started, options and contracts for difference (CFDs) are both financial derivatives - they derive their values from an underlying security e.g. stock, indices, currency, commodities. Long story short, CFDs are more akin to selling naked options - if a position moves against you far enough, you will be forced out of your position either via a stop-loss or a margin call. With options, you can limit the losses using spreads, which means you don't need to use margin and you also maintain your position even if it moves hard past your maximum loss (key is that if it comes back into profit, you'll be back in play)\nCFD trading is regulated as gambling is (and due to this is even treated as tax-free on profits), whereas Options Trading is highly regulated as financial instruments because they genuinely have a use beyond speculation - institutions regularly use options to insure their funds and hedge against major risks for example.\n2. Brokers\nFor this reasons above, there is basically no options market in the UK - the only broker at this time is Saxo, and they only do vanilla options on Forex. Everyone else only does CFDs and\/or stock (T212, Freetrade, IG, Plus500 etc.). To engage in true options trading, the only choice is to open an international\/US brokerage account.\nThe two that are accessible to UK investors are Interactive Brokers (IB) and TastyWorks. Both are reputable brokers and have strong insurances for cash &amp; securities held with them.\n* IB is quite expensive (£20+ pcm minimum), but is the full bells and whistles international trading platform - you may access European options as well as worldwide markets on stocks\/currency\/anything you want really. Recommended for high value traders\/investors. \n* TastyWorks is the opposite - free accounts, low fees (zero inactivity, free stock trades, low option trading fees), though they charge $45 for cash withdrawals. TastyWorks primarily offer trading on US options and stocks, so anything listed on the American stock exchanges are game, including international companies listed via ADRs (e.g. global UK companies, especially on FTSE100). \n3. Opening an account\nI will walk through some of the aspects of funding and operating a TastyWorks account from the UK, as this is my recommendation if you're here looking for a cheap way to get started.\nOpening a free account on TastyWorks is easy (form filling within 20-60 mins - you will need a photo of proof of ID and address). It typically takes 1 day for cash accounts and 2-3 days for margin accounts to be ready for funding. My referral link if you feel this guide deserves the effort is: https:\/\/start.tastyworks.com\/#\/login?referralCode=GD9EGGNZYZ. (mods, happy to remove this is this guide is deemed low effort)\nThe account types are:\n* Cash. Recommended to start because you can always open a margin account easily later. Able to buy long calls\/puts and sell covered options. No short stock allowed. \n* Basic (margin). Able to sell naked puts, and trade defined-risk strategies i.e. anything with a known maximum loss before entering the trade. E.g. credit\/debit spreads. Note that naked puts carry significant risk - this is equivalent to CFD trading on margin, and you can have your position forcibly closed at unfavourable market rates if you overleverage. \n* The Works (margin): everything above, and able to sell naked calls. Note that naked calls carry HUGE risk - this is equivalent to CFD trading on margin, and you can have your position forcibly closed at unfavourable market rates if you overleverage. The difference in naked calls and naked puts: stock can only go to zero, limiting the (huge) loss on a naked put, whereas a naked call has theoretically unlimited loss since stocks can (theoretically) go to infinity. \n4. Funding the Account\nSince trading US options is done in USD, the account must be funded in USD. With TastyWorks, the only option for UK traders is to deposit \"By Wire\", assuming you do not have a US bank account - full instructions for the \"By Wire\" method will show up when you are approved to fund your account.\nTastyWorks does not accept third party transfers (accounts not in your name), so services such as Revolut and TransferWise (inc. borderless) do not work (not directly at least).\nYou can either do an international wire from a GBP account directly (expensive, especially for smaller amounts &lt;£1000) or set up a USD currency account and transfer through that. If you have the time, I recommend the USD currency account.\nThe account of choice is the Barclays USD Foreign Currency account - you need a current account with them to be able to open the USD account. Once the USD account is open, you can transfer into it using Revolut\/TransferWise (cheap) and then international (wire) transfer from Barclays account to TastyWorks (free!). Note that the Barclays USD account is still a UK bank account, so you'll need to use a SWIFT transfer from Revolut\/TransferWise to turn your GBP into USD.\nTo withdraw funds, do the opposite, noting that $45 with be charged by TastyWorks per withdrawal.\nThat's it for the guide - happy trading, and if there are any questions, feel free to get in touch and I'll edit the answers in here. I want this to be a resource because I've helped many people get started, and it would be good to have it all in one place!"}

{"question":"I hear how gold and perhaps bitcoin are “hedges against inflation”, but never hear a logical theory behind the claim.\n\nSuppose my crystal ball tells me that hyper inflation is coming our way (the US). Given that interest rates are currently fairly low, it would be in my best interest to borrow as much as I can long-term. \n\nI could borrow $10 million, buy all the cool stuff that I would ever need for the rest of my life, and when repayment comes due, the hyperinflation would mean that I would be paying back almost nothing. But I still have all my cool stuff.\n\nIs the above analysis essentially correct? And are there any other ways to hedge against inflation?","answer":"&gt;Is this correct? The only true hedge against inflation is debt.\n\nNo. Hedges against inflation don't have to be terribly complicated, anything with sustained positive real returns works just fine. In practice, something like an index fund is plenty.\n\n&gt;I hear how gold and perhaps bitcoin are “hedges against inflation”, but never hear a logical theory behind the claim.\n\nAs far as more \"active\" hedges go, you want goods that rise in value when inflation goes up. A lot of commodities work fine for that.\n\n&gt;I could borrow $10 million, buy all the cool stuff that I would ever need for the rest of my life, and when repayment comes due, the hyperinflation would mean that I would be paying back almost nothing. But I still have all my cool stuff.\n\n*If* you can find a loan with a fixed interest rate, or at least one that isn't able to grow in interest enough, sure.\n\nThe caveat being that actual hyperinflation wreaks havoc to the entire economy, including your income and the supply of goods and services. Now you have a mansion and ten cars, but there's no gas to buy and you don't have the income to pay your electricity bill."}

{"question":"I have recently started learning and investing, I have a full time job and responsibilities so don't get like full day to learn the art of value investing but I really believe in value investing so trying to learn whenever i get some time. \n\nI am not from finance\/accounting background so even a simple financial term will take me some google search to understand it. \n\nSo just wanted to know if someone from non financial background who learnt value investing on their own ? \n\nAny thoughts or approach or starting point or any guidance is appreciated.","answer":"The most basic thing you can do is learn to read a annual\/quarterly report.\n\nIf a company has $10 billion in assets, and 6 billion in liabilities, assume if someone were to buy it today, it’s worth $4 billion.\n\nIf it is trading with 1 billion shares, it’s a $4\/share company. If it’s trading at $8\/share, you should not buy it. Wait until it’s $2-3 a share.\n\nThat will be a first step to avoiding buying something for more than it’s worth. I did this with FLNC. Found out they had $13\/share of net worth *a month ago when they were trading at $25*.\n\nGuess what they are trading for now? $13.9. I could’ve gone all in and been down 50%. Now I’m waiting until they hit $8. Why so low? Well, in three quarters they have continuously lost money, but, their revenues are growing. So I want to also adjust the margin of safety for cash burn and potential set backs. But at $8, I can assume reasonably to see a 50% ROE in a reasonable time frame. Whereas if I bought at $13, I might lose half and need to wait twice as long just to break even."}

{"question":"Seems like nowadays all anyone wants to talk about is day trading\/stock speculation… and they’re all experts.. people that really have no business speculating on stocks let alone giving advice brimming with confidence and throwing themselves at the markets with a total lack of inhibition or concern because all they’ve known is a “buy the dip” mentality as a result of a raging bull market. \n\nDoes the old adage no longer apply in the current market? Do bubbles even matter anymore with all the failsafes in the market now?","answer":"I do not subscribe to that adage anymore, nor do I think others should. However bubbles will still exist. Hear me out before you write the rest of the comment off. \n\nThat adage comes from a different time. The access to information in that world was much different than it is now. Even more so, the access to the markets was fundamentally different. \n\nStocks were not the world of the common man around the time of this adage. It was not really realistic for most people to own stocks, and stocks typically were not held the same way we do now. If you owned stocks, you were wealthy, and you didn’t own stocks the same way a wealthy person does now. You would one or two, not much more. The idea of “owning the market” and diversification was not really around yet. Hence why the stock market crash was so devastating. It wasn’t just jobs that were hard to come by, but previously wealthy people were now broke and their futures and wealth had evaporated. \n\nThe adage basically came from that type of stock market reality. So when the mania was hitting, a shoe shine boy having access to that type of information would have been odd and very unlikely. So the information you were getting was suspect.\n\nThe world we exist in right now, is one where I can download an app, transfer money from my bank and begin buying stocks pretty much instantly. The access to the stock market is among the widest it has ever been. That is all in all a good thing. More access for more people is not a bad thing. Does it have its downsides and risk? Yes, but access is not bad in and of itself.\n\nWe also live in an era where the access to information is better than ever. You can literally learn most anything through some deep diving on Google and YouTube videos. That is incredible, and means that previous information that only would have been available to a few people, can now be available to many many more. That is also good. The downside of that is that interpreting that information becomes something that is self taught and can lead to issues. But that does mean that people can make more informed decisions than ever before. \n\nThere is risk in this. Like you said, when people believe they are experts, they can cause issues that I don’t think I need to explain since we’ve seen the results of that in the last two years. However, mistakes aren’t limited to non-experts. Experts make mistakes too, and having more informed non-experts can help to find faults and flaws in where experts are making conclusions. \n\nSo should you get out of the market when the shoe shine boy gives stock picks now? No, because there is every chance that the shoe shine boy has access to a wealth of knowledge that the average professional investor has available to them too. \n\nWhat it does mean, is you need to learn how to filter that evidence. Don’t take it, or experts advice, at face value. Do your own research. It’s available to you, so become informed. Maybe that stock boy is an idiot. Maybe he’s on to something. You have the ability and means to find out. Do so.\n\nWhere money can be made, idiots will gather. That doesn’t mean you should run away. Inform yourself, do your own research, and know when it is appropriate to run and when it’s not. \n\nAnd do bubbles matter? Yea, and they unfortunately always will. It probably won’t be the thing you think it is though.\n\nEdit: well that’s cool, first gold! Thank you stranger!"}
{"question":"I know a lot of posters on here are able to save so much more. But I'm a single mum, earn $41,000 a year working in aged care. Feeling a bit discouraged as I so want to be able to get a house deposit for me and my bub. Is that amount of money still decent to save?","answer":"Answering your question in title: yes! It's an amazing effort. I have no idea how you're able to save that much on your income while looking after your baby.\n\n&gt;Is that amount of money still decent to save?\n\nThis one is harder to answer positively. I wish I could say yes, but as you allude to, getting a house deposit is a little unrealistic. Since you're on such a low income, banks won't lend you enough to buy a house, yet alone many apartments, until you can put up a much bigger deposit than the \"standard\" 10-20%. It's sad, but true.\n\nYou need to start focusing your energy on more than just saving. If that means saving less so you have more time, that's okay. If I were you, I'd think about whether or not your current career path allow you to boost your income significantly in the future. If not, consider training into one that will.\n\nYou can also think outside of the box. Maybe think of ways you can earn income on the side. If you can earn an extra $2-3k a year from renting out your car space, then consider doing that. Or if you have a hobby consider using it to sell things online or to your neighbourhood. You just may turn it into a sustainable business you can quit your job for.\n\nWith the work ethic you have in saving $10k on your current salary, I have no doubt you can succeed at the things I suggested."}

I'd be looking at upskilling and increasing your income.\n\nPlease don't feel discouraged, you're legitimately doing a fantastic job saving $10k per year, but even if you had $100k saved today your income would be the hurdle seriously limiting your borrowing power. I completely respect that might not change the fact you're on the best path for the next few years while your bub is under school age, but it might be worth considering if there's anything you can change to start a longer term study plan or look around for any alternative jobs (better title and or pay).\n\nIt seems like you'd be a great candiate for a 2% deposit signle parent loan. You've already got a 2% deposit for a $500k purchase (although I'd caution if that's too much for you to borrow on your own), but it might be an idea to talk to a broker or some of the banks who partake in the scheme to see what you'd need to earn to make it happen - [https:\/\/www.nhfic.gov.au\/participating-lenders](https:\/\/www.nhfic.gov.au\/participating-lenders)"}

Very interesting to hear perspectives and how they progress throughout the crisis.\n\n\n[Lecture Series](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HdHlfiOAJyE&amp;list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW)\n\nFor those of you that want a great discussion\/explanation about what caused the mispricing of subprime mortgages (as opposed to the superficial one given in The Big Short), I would recommend the following section from\n\n[Lecture 7: Fixed-Income Securities IV](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZWKnK9LIETA?t=1983)","answer":"I loved watching this course.

They said that he had a couple of days at most left and that we should prepare. He couldnt get surgery because of the meds he was taking causing his blood to be to thin to operate. My mom was hysterical. She was sitting there crying with regret how she didnt spend enpugh time with him and she took for granted the time to spend with him to make money instead. It was a surreal scene. Luckily somehow some way his bleeding stopped overnight and the doctor said he is actually out of the woods.

{"question":"I've read stuff here that day trading is for people in their 20s mostly...\n\nAlso, I read a book on swing trading and it went on and on about the benefits (not having to be glued to the screen, less split second decisions, etc.)\n\nDo you think swing trading has a higher success rate?","answer":"It all depends on your personality and style. Some people have the patience ability to look at the long term and others the quick response and reactions for day trading. \n\nHowever, don't start out day trading and any trading is not a get rich quick scheme. It will take years to become consistent and compound capital. \n\nThe marketing is all a lie.

If you're a swing trade person look at Assad Tannous, Tradeciety and Peter Brandt on Twitter. \n\nAnd be ready for the mind games. Trading will fuck you over in your head and you better be ready for it. But find your niche and focus on one thing at a time. Become a market specialist or a trade specialist. I.e. either a handful of strategies applied on a single market or a single trade style applied across many markets.\n\nGood luck."}
{"question":"I have always been wondering why nordic countries like Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark are so economically successful. I know they have a lot of state owned companies, but other countries like the UK, France, Austria did have high spending too before the 80s, but they were not so successful, actually UK's economy was kind of a disaster in the 70s. So what are Nordic countries doing different that they are doing so well?","answer":"Since nobody here is giving a proper answer, I’ll give it a go (mods be blessed if comment isn’t removed). For background, I studied mordern history (MA w\/research paper on the Norwegian Oil Industry).\n\nThe main reasons at least to Norway’s «Oil Adventure» is of course  many things, but at its core is ‘institutional density’ (if I am to sunmarize it shortly). \n\nTo elaborate, we have a dense set of institutional networks that have been built over centuries all the way back to some time after the Black Death (records get fuzzy until around 1550-1600). Starting with ‘gilder’ (old Norwegian for ‘feast’ in Norwegian) where a group of peasants came together in a proto form of insurance companies. They would feast together where everyone brought some food as payments, and provide food back. Notwithstanding the history of ‘gilder’, such arrangements rose and fell, but the common trend was social safety networks. As literacy started to grow to (relatively) high rates in the 1800s, our society entered what historians call ‘the organizational society’ where organizations arose rapidly. Book clubs are one example, labour unions another. As these organizations grew in number, so too did the general democratic culture (in that you often voted for who became leaders and so forth). This eventually transplanted itself to our political system, where the same phenomenon arose, in that we started to get a plethora of departments and government agencies. Especially after WW2 and the calming of the pre-war social conflicts and lower levels of poverty (and to you Norwegians, no we we’re not “always poor” before the oil- only from 1922\/24 to 1936ish\/1945). \n\nThis trend of organizational growth continued after the war, only this time from the political sphere to the economic. Public companies\/economic organizations a, such as OBOS (google it if you want, they are still around) are an example of how the government started to form social-economic organizations. At around the 1970s, such organizations were manifold. Another result of the high degree of democratization and literacy, was the funding of education. At around the same time, a period of our universities\/education system entered what we call «the people’s universities» (folkeuniversitetene), where enrollement arose from a few hundred each year, to tens of thousands each year. I hope I don’t need to extrapolate on the usefullness of a skilled labour force to economy.\n\nIn regard to the oil aspect, one key agency  to the discovery of oil was the National Petroleum Directorate (Oljedirektoratet) and if course socially minded government policies. Instead of just pro-private policies, it was a mixed market policy. The state secretly bought l Hydro shares, a private company, as well as invited American companies to train Norwegian ones (such as Statoil) in exchange for excavation rights. As Satoil became a giant, it was established that the funds acquired was not to be spent domestically. While I don’t wanna digress too much, the point is to show how the level of organizational density lead to a very high level of democracy and literacy, which again lead to high levels of institutional density, that again lead to publicly owned economic non-profit organizations (and to “socially” minded policies as you’d be voted out pretty quickly if you didn’t).\n\nThe point is, with this high level of institutional density, highly educated work force and organizational density in at least Norway (and Scandinavia at large I would bet) it is very easy to shift the society’s efforts into what is useful and profitable. Be it oil in Norway, heavy industry in Sweden, technology in Finland, and food, or designer industry in Denmark (and whatever else the Danes do)."}

The only thing stopping me is, idk if it's hard for foreigners to make money.","answer":"The problem you'd encounter (apart from being a foreigner, needing to get by in a different language and cope with a different culture) is that, unless you're rich, you'll still have to work. Your life savings up till this point might give you a nice start somewhere cheap, but you'll need a job to keep going. \n\nAnd if you're struggling to get a good job in your current location, there's no reason to expect that it'll be any easier to get a good job anywhere else because you're still the same person with the same skill set - you're just adding additional challenges around language and culture. And whilst the cost of living will be lower, so will the wages. \n\nOverall its one of those things that sounds on the surface like it'd be a good plan, but falls apart once you look into it more deeply. The only way to make it work would be to carefully research where you want to move to, and prepare in advance to make sure you've got a relevant set of skills that'll give you a way to make a decent living, and to make sure you've got the language down fluently."}

Also, I'm starting to feel like there's no reason an advanced, modernized economy shouldn't consider workers getting paid more to do less a positive indicator, even something to be strived for, in which case less poverty and fewer jobs is perhaps the ideal outcome. Call me a dirty socialist, but what are the flaws in my interpretation here? I feel like my thesis must have lots of holes, but I don't understand economics well enough to spot them.","answer":"&gt;To what degree could the loss of jobs be explained by people no longer needing to work 2nd or 3rd jobs?\n\nVery little. If a minimum wage increase reduces employment, it is primarily because some employers find it more profitable not to employ them any more. That is, there are workers presently who, given the current mode of production at their workplace, contribute less than $15 an hour to that productive process. As such, when forced to pay them $15 an hour, the employer would rather not employ them at all."}
{"question":"So according to [this study](https:\/\/www.natcom.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/NCA_C-Brief_2017_March.pdf) for every 1 republican economist, there are 4.5 democrat economists. That is obviously a much bigger ratio of democrats to republicans relative to the general population. But what’s interesting is the ratio of democrats to republicans is 11.5 on average for tenured academic faculty, ranging from 8.6 for law, 17.6 for psychology, 20 for communications\/journalism, and 33.5 for history.\n\nI’m wondering, is there a reason for why 1) economists are way more likely to vote democrat relative to the general population, but 2) way more likely to vote republican relative to other social scientists and academics?\n\nAnd, more importantly, does it have anything to do with the economic policies of democrats and republicans?","answer":"The insights from economics are \"markets generally work  but there are cases where market failures mean market ourcomes can be improved upon with intelligent government intervention\".

{"question":"Got this idea from people talking about money as if it moves out of the economy. Let’s say there’s a dragon demanding cash money or money transfers from some terrified kingdoms, and let’s say this dragon has a big locker where he keeps the money. It might seem like the dragon is making the kingdoms poorer, but if he only hoards money, then wouldn’t those kingdoms experience lower inflation\/deflation, thus making cash savings more valuable over time. So, ceteris paribus, wouldn’t the dragon not be taking wealth but rather redistributing it to people who’ve loaned money and who’ve saved cash? \n\nPs: please ignore the macro effect for a bit, I know that monetary policy can affect growth.","answer":"You are correct that the removal of the medium of exchange from an economy would be deflationary.  And in the simple classical model of the economy, where [money is neutral](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neutrality_of_money), shrinking the money supply would reduce prices, but would not otherwise affect the economy.\n\nIf in a country that uses gold coins as the medium of exchange, a dragon demanded only gold coins, and did not use the gold to buy anything -- in classical theory this would cause deflation but would not reduce real GDP, and would not actually make the country poorer in real terms. \n\nHowever, there are two caveats to this. First, removing gold from the economy would make gold more expensive (increases in the price of gold is equivalent to decreases in the price level). This will move more people and resources into gold mining, which would reduce other productive activities.\n\nSecond, before countries started using paper currency, countries were perennially money starved. The money supply (gold, silver, or copper coins) did not increase as fast as economic growth, and so countries constantly experienced deflation. We know today, that for various technical reasons, the economy works better if there is low constant inflation. (See the [Wikipedia page on inflation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inflation) if you want to know why.) Deflation makes the economy less efficient and holds back economic growth. A dragon constantly draining gold from a countries would worsen the rate of deflation, thus starving the economy of money and further slowing down the economy."}
{"question":"For children of the 1950's and even 1960's, pensions were rather common.  In 1960, roughly half of private-sector workers had access to a pension, as well as workers for larger companies (GE, Goodyear, AT&amp;T, etc).\n\n401k's arrived, but didn't fully replace pensions.\n\nWhat happened?","answer":"I believe what you are referring to are \"defined benefit\" plans. These were set up by companies and were supposed to deliver future payments based on your income and years of service (and other factors). The payments were often adjusted for inflation. These seem great, but they created huge liabilities for the companies. The benefit was defined, but there was no limits put on the costs. \n\nThese were largely replaced with \"defined contribution\" accounts. In these accounts your employer would deposit money based on a set of criteria... The amount is much more easily predicted and does not create the potential for a large future cost.\n\nSo, the cost of pensions ended up being just too high for companies to maintain. These have been almost totally replaced with defined contributions -- The effect on employees is they generally receive much less total money from the company."}

{"question":"Hey guys, I was scrolling through social media and stumbled upon a tiktok video. The dude in the video was saying things like boomers at this age owned something like 25% or like 20% of the world's wealth whereas millenials own only 4%. He went on further to say stuff like that because the avg millienial earns $35000, it is practically impossible for them to own property due to boomers buying all the house and getting the prices up.\n\nHe went on to say that back then you could live without a college degree and that most people could live a decent life just working in a store or something.\n\nIs this true? Did a boomer who was in their mid 20s to 30s really have a better life than the avg person who is mid 20 to 30 now?","answer":"Two points:\n\nThe first is a bit morbid. So far, there has been less inter-generational transfer of wealth to millenials.  The [article in question](https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/millennials-have-just-3-of-us-wealth-boomers-at-their-age-had-21\/) talks about how millenials have a lower share of wealth *in percentage terms*. That makes sense because people are living longer. Concrete numbers are hard to come by, but [this Berkeley dataset](https:\/\/u.demog.berkeley.edu\/~andrew\/1918\/figure2.html) is pretty good. The parents and grandparents of boomers were far less likely to live into their 60s or 70s.  That means the 60-80 segment of the population didn't have as large of a share of overall wealth both because (a) there were fewer people in that age range and (b) boomers were more likely to have inherited from a deceased parent\/grandparent. Now that most people live into their 70s, that 60-80 segment of the population has a higher percentage of overall wealth. When we look at wealth accumulation in absolute, inflation adjusted terms, the net worth of millenials [looks similar to previous generations](https:\/\/ofdollarsanddata.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/per_capita_age_real_nw.jpeg).     \n\n\nSecond, people have [far more education today](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/content\/dam\/Census\/library\/visualizations\/time-series\/demo\/fig_2.png). That means a 25-year-old today is more likely to have only been working full time for a couple years, while a boomer at 25 was likely to have been working full time for 7 years or more.  The 25-year-old college grad today also probably has student loan debt, which boomers usually didn't have, even if they went to college.  That is, millenials are taking longer to enter the workforce and are starting off with more student loan debt. But, over the course of their life, a person with a college degree will usually make an [extra $1 million more](https:\/\/obamawhitehouse.archives.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/page\/files\/20160718_cea_student_debt.pdf) than someone without a degree. So someone \"in their mid 20s to 30s\" now with a college degree might have less wealth than a boomer at the same age, but in the long run the college-educated millenial will earn more, even taking into account the student loan debt."}

Charges wise, I think they charge 15 per quarter for SMS alerts and 100 a year for debit card. Haven't been charged for anything else as far as I recall.\n\nHDFC Salary account is pretty much the same in terms of charges. No minimum balance requirement, 100 or 150 per year for debit card, that's all. But your salary needs to keep flowing into it every month, otherwise they'll stop the benefit at some point."}

He also had the audacity to ask to borrow money from me. \n\nNeedless to say I'm not \"lending\" him a dime and I'm not paying this bill. What are my options?","answer":"**DON'T PAY THE COLLECTION COMPANY A DIME!**\n\nIf you do, they'll take it as an admission of ownership. Don't make any promises to pay, don't say you're interested in a payment plan, nothing. \n\nOn the letter somewhere it should give you instructions about asking for validation of the debt. You'll want to send them a certified letter asking for debt validation. They can't try to collect on it until they validate it. They'll probably validate it in the sense that they will just say it's you because your brother used your information.\n\nYou will also need to contact your local police department and ask them to take a quick report. They can't really do much other than take your report, which is going to be good enough in 99.999% of cases since you're basically swearing to the police what you're telling them is true. \n\nYou'll send that police report to the collection agency and probably the credit card company which will probably get them to stop trying to collect from you.\n\nCheck your credit reports just to make sure he didn't open more than just the one account. Probably have your family members check theirs as well.\n\n[You can check your reports here](http:\/\/annualcreditreport.com)\n\nYour brother sounds like a real low-life. Being addicted to drugs is a disease for sure but what he's doing is affecting more than just himself.\n\n**Edit** Lots of good advice here, just don't count on your brother seeing prison time."}
{"question":"I've heard from a lot of people that say day trading is a very risky career choice because most day traders lose money and it's not worth it. Why is this so, why do most day traders lose money and if \"most\" lose money then there are those \"some\" that are doing well. So what do those day traders do so well that they've capable of having successful day trading careers as opposed to the \"most\" day traders that fail?","answer":"Trading is a very difficult business. Takes years of training to be a consistently profitable trader. Most fail because they don’t treat it like a business. They gamble. They win big for a while and keep pushing their luck. And then like in a casino, they lose it all in a couple bad moves. \n\nIf you see those claiming to make 100%+ in a short period of time, think about what they had to risk to get that type of return (probably 100% of their account). \n\nI’ll admit, it’s tempting to bet big, and some times it works out. But when it doesn’t and you try again, you blow up your account. \n\nJust my 2 cents."}
{"question":"It would be interesting to know whether there's a systematic effort by academics to review the Economic policies of the various governments around the world and offer advice.","answer":"The [Chicago-IGM Economic Experts Panel](https:\/\/www.igmchicago.org\/igm-economic-experts-panel\/) is close to a (US centric) version of this. They regularly poll top economists on the efficacy and implications of controversial policies, and the economists are encouraged to provide justification and sources for their answers. Responses are rarely in-depth, but it's a fantastic barometer of general economist sentiment and can give you good starting sources. It's been running for years, so you can dig up results for just about any topic of interest."}
{"question":"The Cayman Islands, and other similar tax havens have no corporate tax. There are over 100k companies based there, but the Cayman Islands doesn't receive tax revenue from these companies, and I imagine many of these companies don't provide significant employment since they're mostly only using these places for an address. So what do these tax havens get out of the deal?","answer":"They still charge registration fees for new businesses. Apart from that, the government levies import duties and other indirect taxes. The country has a sprawling tourism industry which generates quite an income."}
{"question":"[Link to the full article (3 min read)](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/10\/26\/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q3-2022.html) Shares of Meta plummeted in the extended trading after reporting a second straight revenue decline in Q3 and forecasted another drop in Q4. Meta is facing slowdown in online ad spending, challenges with Apple’s IOS privacy update, and losing users to TikTok. Meta’s revenues dropped 4% while expenses rose 19% from the same time last year. Revenues in their VR headsets and metaverse related business fell by nearly half from a year ago and has lost $9.4 billion so far this year. Meta stocks have already lost two-third of its value this year prior to the plunging share prices in the after market on Wednesday.\n\n**Check out** [**investorsnippets.com**](https:\/\/investorsnippets.com\/) **to get more bite-sized news like straight to your inbox for free.**","answer":"Meta has 4 of the 5 most used social media apps with between 1-3 billion users. Facebook won't grow users but it doesn't need to. It already reaches half the planet. This is clearly a MOAT. The only comp it faces is a Chinese app that could be banned. \n\nFacebook isn't popular with kids and young adults but IG is. It doesn't matter that much if young kids don't like these apps given adults 25+ are still likely to use them unless something better comes along.\n\nI am unconvinced the Metaverse will be a thing, or Meta the company will benefit but Meta has tens of billions if dollars to risk on this investment. \n\nMy opinion on Meta is it was clearly overvalued at the $300+ range, so I stayed away. As it entered the $200 range it made sense to buy, but I still thought there wasn't enough upside. At $100 it is a no brainer buy."}
{"question":"As with many people on this sub, I am invested in ETFs. But I have suddenly wondered if, as a tradable commodity, it is possible that an ETF becomes worth more (or indeed less) than the stocks which are part of its make up. \n\nLet's say, for simplicities sake, that there are two companies called STK1 and STK2 with shares in each costing £1. An ETF (called ETF1) is made up of these two companies so it would seem reasonable to assume that ETF1 would cost £2. But if demand for ETF1 shoots up, surely ETF1's price could go beyond the underlying value of the shares it is made up of?","answer":"Great question. Not only is it possible, it happens pretty much all the time. This is a broadly similar problem for Investment Trusts as well.  \nAn ETF's **Net Asset Value (NAV)** is the sum of all share values minus any liabilities such as loans or other payables. In your case the NAV of ETF1 is £2.\nDue to all various factors such as market differences, liquidity, timing differences and behavioural preferences its perfectly possible that ETF1 might be trading at £2.10 on the LSE. We call this trading at a **premium** (10p or 5%). If its trading below £2 we call this trading at a **discount**. \n\nOne example of how this might be caused is that the US market is closed, but the LSE is open. Trading on a UK ETF can happen freely while its underlying US stocks are frozen until they reopen. Thanks to the magic of efficient markets these usually correct themselves fairly quickly.\n\nSometimes though an ETF is persistently trading at a premium. This is quite common where you have an ETF traded in an 'attractive' market or currency such as UK or US holding stocks in emerging markets with diverse currencies. As an investor even if the ETF is trading at a premium its far easier, cheaper and less risky to buy the ETF than purchase its component parts.  \n\nTo fix this the ETF manager will take matters into their own hand and try to correct the pricing difference themselves. This is called a **Creation\/Redemption** (or alternatively Buyback\/Issuance for Investment Trusts). If the ETF is trading at too high a premium they will create new shares in the ETF. For each new share in ETF1 they will have to buy the component Stk1 and Stk2. The extra share in ETF1 will then be sold on the market. This process increases the demand for Stk1 and Stk2 (increasing NAV) while also increasing the supply of ETF1 (lowering price). If calculated correctly this will reduce the NAV premium."}
{"question":"There is a severe housing shortage in NYC, reflected in through-the-roof rents. On the other hand, you see headlines [like this](https:\/\/www.thecity.nyc\/2022\/5\/31\/23145072\/nycs-population-plummeted-during-peak-covid-and-its-still-likely-shrinking) indicating that people have left and are continuing to leave the city. Something isn't adding up here, is there an explanation that I'm missing?","answer":"This is one of the cases where reasoning from a price change can be misleading. I don't have any specific knowledge about New York, but\n\n&gt; Rent went up in NYC. Are there more people living there now, or fewer people?\n\nDoesn't have a clear answer. People leaving NYC should cause prices to go down, but prices going up should cause people to leave NYC. So the relationship between rent and net migration is a bit complicated - it depends on why rent is going up."}

The computers and TVs the price is going up and price of vehicles are going up.\n\nThe US dollar is weakening.\n\nWith everyone going back to work the economy should be getting better not worse. Why is the opposite happening?","answer":"There's two answers to this.\n\nFirst, the economy *is* getting better, not worse. Unemployment has fallen to 4.8%, around where it was in 2017. GDP, which is roughly a measure of how much money people make, has gone up a bunch too (even after you account for rising prices). Most economists consider these two statistics to be the most important for understanding the economy.\n\nThat being said, prices are definitely going up, which is a major problem. As usual it's a supply+demand thing.\n\nOn the supply side, ramping up production takes a long time for some goods. For instance, a new fab (computer chip factory) takes about 7 (!) years to build, and finding a new hire to fill a position usually takes months.\n\nOn the demand side, people are spending more because they're more optimistic about the economy and because COVID stimulus put a lot of money in peoples' pockets. When aggregate demand increases, the economy grows and people get put to work, but prices go up.\n\nRight now, the Federal Reserve thinks the price increases are temporary. They think that as the supply problems get sorted out, prices will fall back to normal, so they don't have to try cutting back demand and risking a recession."}

{"question":"Singapore does not have a net debt: [according to](https:\/\/commodity.com\/data\/singapore\/debt-clock\/) their constitution they can only borrow to invest, not to spend in their economy. This means that their assets are greater than their liabilities. \n\nWould it be better if all countries would do this instead of working with a debt-based economy?\n\nEDIT:  By investing I mean that Singapore only borrows to internationally invest in the markets with the only goal of obtaining values. They have two sovereign wealth funds, Temasek and GIC, that with a portfolio of investment focus on maximizing returns on government funds. This in contrast to other countries that invest to fund running the country. However, Singapore does invest, i.e. spend their returns on social programs in their country.","answer":"It depends on the country.\n\nDeveloping countries get a lot more return on investments in public infrastructure and might lose out on growth by maintaining austerity.

{"question":"Productivity in Brazil has been stagnant for 30 years. We were richer than China in the early 1990s, but now we are humiliated in every way. Why did this happen?","answer":"I was able to find [this presentation deck](https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/economy\/growth\/OECD-NERO-june-2017-labour-productivity-in-Brazil.pdf) from IBRE arguing that labour productivity in Brazil has increased at a lower rate due to Brazilian firms typically being smaller than in other countries (with cited sources in the slide deck; see [Akcigit, Alp and Peters (2016)](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/aer.20180555)). Brazilian firms do not appear to expand in the same way as in other countries, and this may be due either to traditional business practices or due to tax incentives that provide savings for small businesses that report revenues under a certain amount.\n\nSmall businesses will be less likely to benefit from scaling up production and utilizing economies of scale per unit of labour, the definition of labour productivity. If economic and tax policy favours small businesses too much or if large sectors of the Brazilian economy are comprised mainly of small businesses for practical or other reasons, this will put a hard cap on labour productivity growth in the future. Changing tax codes, creating business incentives to expand, or diversifying the economy into industries with larger firms may all be solutions to increasing overall labour productivity."}

{"question":"For supply and demand to be a [Law](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scientific_law) it must be true that supply curves are upward sloping and demand curves are downward sloping. But this isn't the case, as demand curves can at times not slope downward Veblen or Giffen goods\/behavior for example. Economists in contemporary times like to make the argument that in general supply and demand does apply despite not always, but that precludes it from being an actual law compared to say, the Conservation of Energy or Universal Gravitation. \n\nDoes this highlight the way the discipline shares a place with so called 'Soft' or Social Science rather than Natural Sciences?","answer":"Let me clear-up some fundamental misunderstandings here.\n\n&gt; For supply and demand to be a Law it must be true that supply curves are upward sloping and demand curves are downward sloping.\n\nNot necessarily - they can be horizontal too. The point is that you, *ceteris paribus* won't demand more of something when its price increases. The crux of the law is a causal argument. You will generally want less of a good when a price increases. You will not want more of a good when a price increases.\n\n&gt;  But this isn't the case, as demand curves can at times not slope downward Veblen or Giffen goods\/behavior for example.\n\nThe *ceteris paribus* above is important. For a Giffen good, the main point is that the income-effect dominates the substitution effect. That is, you do not *want* more of a certain good but a lack of other options forces you to get more of the good. If you would compensate the wealth effect -- so the price would increase without a real-term loss of wealth, you would actually demand less of the good. Though I'd say compared to Veblen goods, this point would be debatable.\n\nFor a Veblen good, percieved value increases with price-increase (as noted on the [wiki](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Veblen_good#Non-violation_of_the_law_of_demand)). This means there is no violation of the law of demand because that assumes a *ceteris paribus* situation -- as such, paying a higher price for *the same product\/value\/utility*. As the product becomes more valuable with a price increase, this negates that violation.\n\n&gt;  Economists in contemporary times like to make the argument that in general supply and demand does apply despite not always, but that precludes it from being an actual law compared to say, the Conservation of Energy or Universal Gravitation.\n\n\nAs far as I know, it does always apply. But what people generally fail to attach to this (and all) laws is that they work *under certain conditions* and *with certain constraints*. These are fundamentally a part of the law. The law of supply and demand explains *ceterus paribus* behavior to price changes. If you could spend x$ to get utlity y, you are not going to spend &gt;x (what about tipping? - well that increases y).\n\nThe same goes for natural laws. The law of gravity results in a conclusion that something should fall towards the earth at a given speed. But, in fact, this doesn't occur like that all. Factors like wind, air-pressure, object surface, general interference (and so on, I'm not a physicist) create results which in fact differ slightly from the intuition. The problem with laws on human behavior is then that the constraints are quite likely to be violated, that these violations aren't always systematic, and that this makes them less intuitive. Basic supply and demand models are, for example, based on free and immidiate entry, perfect information, and no transaction costs. The combination of these factors don't exist in real life -- but we do consistently emperically find that moving closer to this scenario moves us closer to the model.\n\n&gt; Does this highlight the way the discipline shares a place with so called 'Soft' or Social Science rather than Natural Sciences?\n\nNo - that is semantics matter, not really related to 'laws'. Is neuroscience not a natural science because it has no laws? That Economics is a social science is in the name. It deals with society and human behavior. Physics deals with the behavior of 'nature'. This is what seperates the two. This is often coloqially (and in reality quite often as well in outcomes) linked -- generally consistent findings are harder in social sciences because human behavior is complex and because the performed research can influence the outcomes of said research. \n\nFeel free to search on the subreddit further; this topic has been discussed quite a few times (e.g. [1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/o7x4xu\/is_economics_science\/), [2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/p5n8gg\/to_what_extent_is_economics_a_science_to_what\/), [3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/lk3gnt\/before_every_major_crisis_there_are_always_one_or\/)) and there is a valuable discussion in the [faq](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_methods#wiki_are_there_laws_of_economics.3F). Generally, the most simple answer to your feeling of discomfort is that, just because a science is complex and may make incorrect predictions, does not make it not a science. Think of meteorology, for example. Discussions between economists are usually not as principled as people think - they are mostly on whether the assumptions we make to draw conclusions are justified."}

A business that has $1,000 in sales a year and $1,000 in expenses per year can continue operation without issue, they just aren't generating any profits that would then generate income taxes.\n\nThe second piece builds on the first. Among a businesses expenses are their debt payments. There is some complexity here in terms of tax treatment, but keeping it simple, any debt payments you are making reduce your potential profits.\n\nThe third piece is that in terms of real estate, those physical properties are generally going to appreciate in value over time. This has the effect of increasing equity (value of the property less any debt owed on the property), but has no effect on profits until the property actually changes hands.\n\nThe fourth piece connects the 2nd and 3rd. As a business pays down debts, they are increasing their equity in the property. Combining the appreciation (increase in value of the property) and the debt payments, you can have a business that is worth quite a bit of money because of the equity in the property, but is generating no annual profits (often intentionally). A business can build significant equity without ever generating a profit and then go to a bank, who will lend additional money on the existing equity of a property. The money raised from this debt can be used to fund ongoing expenses.\n\nThe fifth piece is specific tax treatments such as depreciation that allow a business to recognize largely paper expenses that produce favorable tax outcomes. The idea behind depreciation is good, when you build a building, it is going to degrade over time and be worth less than it was the day it was built. Stated more plainly, a new building built on the same piece of land is worth more than an old building on the same piece of land.\n\nThe last piece rolls up all of this together. We're hearing about the aggregated results of a large organization with several different properties and streams of income. Over time some of those properties may be sold (or part of them sold) and some of the businesses may generate some profits used to fund expenses from other business lines that allow a cycle of losing money from a tax standpoint to continue for a considerable period of time."}

{"question":"I have no idea how to ask this question. Apple's stock price is $127.14 per share right now. I would like to know what it's going to take for this stock to go up to $127.50 for example.

I know that people buying and selling the stock is what makes the price go up and down. But exactly how will buying let's say $1000 worth of apple share will influence the market? Basically, I want to know the details of how the price of a share goes up and down. Hope this makes sense to someone!","answer":"A stock exchange works this way:\n\nThere is buyers, who put out an ad (quote) for buying this stock for X amount of money and there are sellers, who put out an ad for Y amount of money.\n\nBuyer1 want to buy 5 AAPL for 124\n\nBuyer2 want to buy 4 AAPL for 125\n\nSeller1 want to sell 10 AAPL for 128\n\nSeller2 want to sell 2 AAPL for 129\n\nand so on. It is just and (almost) endless stream and if ordered in a way that you have all quotes lined up with the highest buy order on top and the lowest sell order on the is called an (ordered) book. The difference between the highest buy (125) and the lowest sell order (128) is called the spread. In the above example, the spread is 3 (its usually much smaller).\n\nNow two things can happen: accidentally they meet and match, like:\n\nSeller3 want to sell 3 AAPL @ 125\n\nThat ends with a trade Seller3 selling 3 AAPL for 125 to Buyer2.\n\n or someone comes in and says explicitly \"I want to accept Seller1's offer\" (technically there is not much difference).\n\nNow as everyone can change their quotes or remove them again in split seconds this fluctuates the whole time. People on the market adjust the prices for a lot of reasons, be it expectations on the company or on the market trying to simply game each other. You can see this in action in the link u\/daybyter2 On the left you see the book with the prices and amounts and on the right the trades which are done.\n\nNow what is the price of AAPL?

{"question":"Productivity in Brazil has been stagnant for 30 years. We were richer than China in the early 1990s, but now we are humiliated in every way.

It took roughly 338 days dealing with construction permits alone. So much regulation is incredibly restrictive and hurts investments into Brazil, and discourages innovation immensely. Thirdly is access to financing for businesses. Brazil has high interest rates for businesses, which are a result of its policy of wanting to have a balanced budget, but as a result, this is hurting business investment and innovation, and therefore indirectly productivity growth.

Depending on your needs, you can get a 1-room flat for less than 1.000CHF. Also, you can go to Germany or France for grocery shopping. I believe you will have the most cash left at the end of the month in Basel. Say if you spend 1.000 on rent, 500 on healthcare, then you can spend another 1.200 and still have more money left than you would even *earn* in Germany.\n\nAnd since this is a personal finance community: It should be noted that Switzerland has, generally speaking, no capital gains tax for private investors, and that US ETFs are available.\n\nAlso, if it matters: Basel is \"closest to home\" geographically speaking. There are multiple direct trains a day taking you to Milan in about 4 hours."}

{"question":"I know they didn't \"go\" anywhere, but I'm curious how there's not enough houses all of a sudden? Like, just a handful of years ago there wasn't a housing shortage, and I don't believe the population has grown by an unexpected amount.\n\nI've heard that it's single family homes being turned into rentals, but then wouldn't you expect there would be *pleanty* of rentals available right now? And there's a shortage of those too. \n\nI've also heard that companies (BLACKROCK?) buying houses and leaving them vacant, but when I drive through my neighborhood I don't see vacant houses by any meaningful amount.\n\nIs it the eviction\/foreclosure moratoriums? Like people who would normally live with roommates have been living alone without paying rent\/mortgage?\n\nI'm just wondering how we can go from having enough houses to not-enough houses in such a short time. Where did they go?","answer":"\"Where do they go\" is an appropriate question, with the wrong subject. Of course houses don't just move. But people do.\n\nTo put it a bit differently, the housing shortage was never about there not being enough housing in general, but there not being enough housing *in certain (high demand) areas*.\n\nAnd it's not a particularly new phenomenon. It's generally true that most of these places have very small vacancy rates though.\n\nThere are certainly factors that exacerbate this temporarily, but broadly speaking it's the result of urbanisation that has gone on for decades if not centuries. A tad less broadly speaking, it happens because the influx of people in the areas where people want to move to, like New York, Boston, etc. is much greater than the increase in housing supply and has been for a while. Demand goes up, supply doesn't, you get what people perceive as a shortage.\n\nThis has indeed slowed down a tad during the pandemic, but we're just seeing the trend continue."}

(For the retardeder folks, this is the number of shares available for trading).\n\n* The number of shares short is still above 68M. \n\n* The number of shares held by institutions is 122% of the total number of shares, or 86.62M shares. \n\n* This is 155% of the float. \n\n* But, how many shares do retail investors hold? (How many shares can be traded if we fucking keep holding?)\n\nA number was released today that 50% of Robinhood users held GME. That’s roughly 6.5M users. And, that’s only RH users. Let’s extrapolate across other brokers, our euro bros, our Asian bros, and our bros from down under, and call it an even 8M users. (Might be low). \n\nIf we make the assumption that each retail holder has 1 share, that’s 8M shares. Or, 17% of the float. If the average user has 3 shares, that’s 24M shares, or 51% of the float. If it’s 5 shares, that’s 85% of the float. I don’t know what the numbers are, but you get the idea. \n\nWhat does this mean? It means we have the power. If you compare to the VW squeeze, we are Porsche. But, we have help. There are some others (not Burry) who are holding 1M+ positions, those cut into the float also. \n\nThat means that eventually, to close their short positions, the short holders MUST buy retail’s shares. They have to have your bananas. \n\nAnd, failing to close the short will continue to cost them. They have to keep paying the longer they hold the short. They are renting the share. And, eventually, the bean counters will decide that the market price is better than the rent. That’s the squeeze. \n\nDon’t fucking sell. We know that apes are stronger together, but recognize what a huge portion of this stock we control. We are, together, the largest holder of GME. And!!!! We have no margin. We have no risk.

I think we'll see oil and gas hang around longer than people think on the basis of its affordability and energy density relative to weight compared to other sources of fuel.\n\nWith regards to the earnings, oil and gas is a notoriously cyclical business.

{"question":"Are there any countries that tie minimum wage to living costs or the inflation rate? We say “a citizen’s time is worth no less than $X\/hr” and then that value slowly depreciates over time until a new law is passed.","answer":"To answer the question in the title, maybe. It depends on what you would take to be the objective of minimum wage policy. \n\nOne possible objective you could have in mind for minimum wage policy is just to use it to offset employers' monopsony power in low wage labor markets (so, an efficiency maximizing \/ employment maximizing goal). In this world, probably, inflation indexing is the wrong call. For one, the amount of monopsony power in low wage labor markets might change over time, making the initial real minimum wage possibly too high or too low. For two, for a fixed quantity of monopsony power, probably the efficiency maximizing optimal minimum wage will rise at a rate closer to that of nominal productivity growth (or median wage growth) - making the inflation rate too slow a growth rate.\n\nAnother objective might involve setting a particular minimum standard of living for workers for normative reasons. In this case, I guess inflation rate indexing would be optimal.\n\nAnother issue to consider is one related to the legislative process. Policy makers might be interested in setting the maximum minimum wage before notable negative employment effects kick in. But, probably, nobody knows exactly what that minimum wage level is in advance. In principle, policy makers could just experiment with the minimum wage until they found the optimal one. But if they can't adjust the minimum wage frequently, they might just set an ambitious one and then reckon that inflation will take care of things if they set it too high. So giving policy makers the option to set an ambitious starting minimum wage that then fades out until it can be adjusted later after evaluation may be a good idea in some political contexts."}

{"question":"I’m talking about all salaries, not just starting salary. If people don’t know what other jobs\/positions are making doesn’t it prevent people from filling in market efficiencies? \n\nFor example, if I knew that a web developer working for a nearby company was getting paid 10$ to make a website, I wouldn’t bat an eye. If he was making 1000$ and I believe I can do a better job than him, I might want to fill in that inefficiency and offer to build a better website for half the cost. But since In real life I don’t know how much the developer is charging, I would assume the exchange is fair and that there is no need for me to do anything. \n\nI understand that there is a bit of game theory at play and reasons for people to want to hide their salary. But assuming we were to implement a system forcing employers to disclose all salaries and compensation at all time, would the labor market be more efficient?","answer":"Complete information is a basic assumption for the perfect market. If I just take your title into account the answer is a simple yes.\n\nAs this sub's goal is to improve economic understanding, I want to clarify some things you mentioned in the second paragraph.\n\nJust because both parties ageee to something it does not automatically have to be fair (one can't even ultimately define what actually is fair because this depends on political views which must not be discussed here). As a player competing in a market where prices are hidden and many buyers do not know how do determine whether a website is that good, we're dealing with asymmetric information. As you get more experienced and strike more deals, you get a better feeling for prices even in hidden markets.\n\nYou as a rational player should not assume that the deals you spot are efficient. You can try to convince the buyer by writing an offer or getting drunk with their marketing team or similar. This of course causes costs (time you could use to work on other things, money for booze and transportation) and has a risk of not leading to a deal. If net profit times probability surpasses the costs (minus the benefit from a good night with drunk marketing people) you should go for it.\n\nEdit: Spelling"}
{"question":"In my area there is a big apartment complex and that's pretty much the biometer for the rent charged. Earlier in the year (March) - 1 bedroom was going for $1800 and up and since the summer, the complex has been slowing dropping price and now one bedroom is going for $1400. I have one rental unit in the area. The tenant is currently paying $1750, but decided to move out at the end of Oct.  It requires at least $1700 to cash flow positive. This is in the suburb of Philly. Wondering what you guys would recommend doing? Should I try to list it on par with the big apartment complex (aka lower rent) but then i would be cash flow negative for $300 a month. Pre-covid rent would be about $1200 so it is still up a bit.

{"question":"I'm curious because I'm wondering if its really resource or just insatiable greed that drives war, globalization, etc.. So here is a thought experiment. \n\nSay human are only 1\/4 size of what we are and consume only 1\/4 of our calories, same reproduction rate, and lifespan,  do you think globalization, war and even our economy would 1) be similar 2) if so, do you think it would had expanded at the same rate? May be eventually we will still have those wars but just take much longer? How do you think our current economies will be like?","answer":"Biologist here, so no economist but maybe some expertise relevant to my speculation. Firstly to scale our resource consumption down by 1\/4 would probably not be achieved by making us 1\/4 of the size, because biology doesn't scale that way. Smaller animals have relatively more surface area, and an animal 1\/4 the size of a human would probably consume more than 1\/4 the calories. Lots of other things wouldn't scale the same. Brain size for instance - while certain parts of brains scale with body size, there's no reason to think an animal 1\/4 the size of a human could do the same amount of abstract thought with 1\/4 the brain tissue. Our size relative to other animals and plants would also be different - animals would be huge relative to us, capable of moving huge loads, and much more dangerous, so one could imagine that effecting how useful they are in warfare.\n\nAs far as the meat of the question goes though - what if we consumed 1\/4 the resources, it's worth noting that according to some (I gather by no means all) historians, many societies were trapped in a resource limited 'malthusian trap' prior to the industrial revolution. The limits of that trap would still presumably have been reached by our hobbit people, but presumably at higher population densities - however little resources we consume, we'd eventually have increased population sizes till we hit some limiting resource, and that would lead to scarcity and many of the same things that happened in the real world."}
{"question":"Oil has been making a lot of money lately but none of it is being reinvested back into the business. There are very low capital expenditures due to carbon emissions, and these large profits are instead going directly to shareholders through paying down debt and buybacks. Regarding the no reinvestment and what is currently happening in Ukraine, it seems to me that oil will stay high priced for a while. What else am I missing?","answer":"I'm a finance guy who's been in Oil &amp; Gas for 12 years. \n\nYou're correct. Prices are very likely to remain above $70, despite all of the calls for a major recession. People often don't take into account the [serious inventory shortages](https:\/\/www.eia.gov\/dnav\/pet\/hist\/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=WCRSTUS1&amp;f=W) that the SPR releases have been papering over this year. We've drained over half of the SPR, and crude inventories are still at multi-decade lows. And almost none of this is due to electrification of cars and trucks. Ukraine has had a very big effect on this because we have been exporting more crude to Europe in order to help offset the Russian crude embargoes.\n\nEven though it was painful to endure 2020, COVID ended up being a a much needed shock that the industry needed - especially for upstream firms. Prior to COVID, balance sheets were notoriously over-levered, and capital budgets were often pegged in excess of 1.5-2.0x the prior year's operating cash flow. This meant that, although EBITDA could grow (and keep the company's debt profile under control), equity investors would see little result, as companies were recklessly growing volumes in order to service all of the bonds, term loans and revolving lines of credit that the companies had taken out in the 2010's. \n\nPart of this was needed, as that decade was really dedicated to acquiring and testing out methods in the Permian Basin. The industry also learned the hard way that shale plays in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus and Bakken are much tougher to realize good ROIC, and so a lot of capital was wasted trying to perfect very imperfect geological formations. Nowadays, most E&amp;P firms have retrenched into a much more capital-friendly basin in the Permian. The methods employed in the Permian are much more efficient because of wider pay zones (geological formations with oil-bearing rock), cleaner drilling rights (biggest landowners usually own thousands of blocks of acreage, making land acquisition costs lower), and more efficient drilling\/completion scheduling (2 mile lateral wells, and more tightly packed wells on a 640-acre drilling unit).\n\nSo while the Permian set-up phase took a decade to play out, and cost the companies dearly in debt and equity costs, COVID ended up being a huge boon for the industry for a few reasons:\n\n1) Easy Fed policy meant that the industry could refinance their oftentimes 6-7%-yielding bonds into far more manageable 3-4% bonds. Same with bank loans. Across the industry, interest rates plummeted, and bondholders were willing to exchange their notes for lower rates and longer maturities (thanks, Fed!). This dramatically eased the burden that companies faced every quarter when making interest payments and also maintaining debt\/EBITDA covenants, which were also eased in these amendments.\n\n2) With debt service costs now better managed, as well as a capital-light 2020, E&amp;P firms started realizing very significant cash flows from existing oil &amp; gas production. The introduction of the vaccines in November 2020 - only 6 months after prices had plummeted - also saved the industry's bacon. This meant that the economy could reopen sooner, and drive up oil &amp; gas demand. Prices quickly rebounded up to a survivable $60-$70 \/ $3-$4 level, which, coupled with dramatically reduced capex budgets, meant that firms could simply collect cash flow and clean up their balance sheets even further. We've seen Debt\/EBITDA ratios drop from 5.0x in 2019 to &lt;3.5x in most cases (and even lower for the healthier firms like DVN and PXD). \n\n3) The greater spending discipline has also helped to stabilize prices at &gt;$70\/Bbl, since firms aren't chasing high prices as overaggressively as they did in the past. Remember, they don't have massive debt costs to service in order to stay in business anymore, so for the first time in a long time, companies are actually free to spend at their discretion, instead of feeling that they have to play catch-up with their lenders.\n\nSo long story short, COVID cleaned up oil firms' balance sheets dramatically, and the quick vaccine development kept prices up to healthy levels. The industry is completely flush with cash and is returning it to long-waiting shareholders after they endured decades of overspending. Assuming that this discipline holds (and we'll see what happens as interest rates rise sharply), firms should be able to keep drilling capital light in the next few years and keep prices high enough to protect their bottom lines.\n\nI've been a huge Energy bull for many more reasons than I've discussed above, but as a prospective investor, I'd encourage you to see those quoted &gt;7% yields on MLP and E&amp;P dividends as very real, and very protected."}

{"question":"The most popular saying of all time. I've come here to see if it's true.\n\n.”The wealth gap between upper-income and lower- and middle-income families has grown wider this century. Upper-income families were the only income tier able to build on their wealth from 2001 to 2016, adding 33% at the median. On the other hand, middle-income families saw their median net worth shrink by 20% and lower-income families experienced a loss of 45%”\n\nIs what someone told me today (or most likely quoted from somewhere else). Does this mean that the saying is true?","answer":"TL;DR It depends on who you mean by the poor. The global poor have been getting \"richer\", the Western poor not so. In both cases, the rich are definitely getting richer.\n\nThe other comments seem to be arguing about [Thomas Pickety's work](https:\/\/www.hup.harvard.edu\/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006) on inequality in the West. That rightly gets a lot of attention, but it's still very much [debated by top-economists](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/After-Piketty-Agenda-Economics-Inequality\/dp\/0674237889\/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=after+picketty&amp;qid=1605702524&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1).\n\nI think that this focus on the West also misses out some really important points.\n\nThere is a famous graph in economics called the \"[elephant curve](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/research\/charts\/elephant-curve-world-inequality)\" (image [here](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/content\/file?id=9356)). Imagine a big \"hump\" (showing how the global poor have benefited), then a dip (showing the global middle-class has stagnated), and then a \"trunk\" (showing how the global rich have *really* benefited).\n\nTo your question, it thus all depends on who you mean when you say \"the poor\". If you think about it on a global level then poor people are unambiguously better off now than 40 years ago (i.e. the rise of countries like China and India saw the biggest ever reduction in human poverty).\n\nBut if you think about it on a national level -- i.e. the poor in the US and Europe (who might are still middle-class on a global level) -- then your friend seems to be onto something. They have hardly seen any wage gains since 1980 (and are much worse off in other ways). So there is a case to say they are getting \"poorer\".\n\nThe quite shocking thing is just how much the top 1% has gained in comparison. They captured almost 27% of all global growth! Whatever way you look at it, the rich have definitely been getting richer.\n\nOn another point, there is an interesting \"[Simpson's paradox](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Simpson%27s_paradox)\" in inequality. It says that inequality can rise in every individual country but at the same time decrease globally. This is because developing countries are catching up to the Global North and many more people live in those countries.

{"question":"I've read that Marxism has fallen so out of favor in economics that there are few, if any economists who take it seriously.\n\nI'm not a Marxist if for no other reason than it requires the discredited labor theory of value, but Marx did make some amazing predictions, including the mass displacement of workers by technology (and yes, I know he dropped the ball on a number of others—he should have taken Malthus seriously).\n\nPerhaps a better question would be, \"what place, if any, does Marx have in economics today other than as a historical curiosity?\"","answer":"It is generally true that economists tend to waive off Marxist critique in their analysis, in no small part because of the labour theory of value issue. However, Marxist economics is still an active albeit small field in the broader field of economics, and some academics are still active in publishing work analyzing modern economic outcomes with a Marxist perspective. The one I know the best is David Harvey, who has published (not sure if peer-reviewed) critiques of global neoliberal economics. To some extent, Thomas Piketty's *Capital in the 21st Century* incorporates a data element that is missing in much of the work of Marx and his contemporaries, and offers a slate of mechanisms that are more in line with modern economic theory that explain similar patterns predicted by Marx, including the accumulation of wealth over time and potential disruptors of that process under a capitalist framework.\n\nI would argue that Marxism is mostly dismissed in economics because it hasn't been updated in the language of economics in quite some time. When Marx was writing, economics was a less rigorous and mathematical discipline, a change which didn't occur until Alfred Marshall in the early 20th century. Since that time, the Marxist literature has mostly focused either on vague criticisms of capitalism or specific analyses of productive processes and the qualitative aspects of capitalist production. (See for example Adorno's \"Culture Industry\") That's not to say that Marxism does not provide valuable insights or criticisms of modern economic theory, it just hasn't been done in a way that is consistent with the economics discipline in the 21st century."}

{"question":"Edited: I realized the past year I spent a ton of time looking at option chains, monitoring positions, and hoping to collect premium every month. Learning all the basic technicals as well. Only to have my gains for the past year mostly wiped out just recently. The time, effort, stress isn’t worth it. Also the impact on work and how much time I spend all day and night looking at it. Moving all my funds to target funds and going to set it and forget it. \n\nIt was fun to learn, but not worth the physical toll. Best of luck to the rest of you.","answer":"You need to focus on stocks you want to own long term.  This does not include meme stocks and get rich quick symbols.  I collect anywhere from 500-1500 per month in premium strickly selling CCs and CSPs.  I sell CSPs on stocks i want to own and if i dont get assigned then awesome.  I sell CCs out of the money on stocks i want to keep but and willing to let go at that price plus the premium.  And lastly I sell CCs to get out of stocks I am loosing on to brink my basis back to break even.  I close every trade at 50% profit and 40% if it has been there for two days or more.   I check my portfolio 3 times a day for no more than 10 minutes.  Lastly if i have a trade going super sideways I ALWAYS have enough cash or margin to cost average down to use an option to bring me back break even or better.  Since following this strategy I have not had a loss on a symbol that i have opened in the past 6 months and am almost out or break even on any that I opened prior to that.  Currently I am outperforming all the major indices over 12 \/ 6 \/ and 3 months.  While i am not going to get rich in a day I do believ that after i move my other 150k in investments over that in 10 years I will have enough to be comfortable and within the next three years i could sell my business and trading be the only thing I do.\n\nAccount size 35000\n\nUsage for options is around 15000\n\nTrades per week 5-10\n\nDTE 7-180 (see above sometimes you have to go far out to cover a loss but you still have to believe in the stock)\n\n\nEdit: PS if you dont believe in a stock anymore GTFO (Get the F*** Out!!!)\n\nEdit: Fixed terrible mobile formatting since someone thought i am making 15000 trades per week.\n\nEdit: \n\n I have had a lot of people ask me how I find the stocks to collect premium on. \n\nTo clarify, my stategy is long to medium term hold.  I use premiums for three things.  \n\n1) CSP: Aquire stock that I want to own but is not quite in my price target.  In this case I don not care if i get assigned or not.  If i get assigned then I get the stock at a price i am comfortable with.  If I get to 50% profit or 40% for at least two days in a row I close the position.  NOBODY LOSES MONEY TAKING A PROFIT.\n\n2) CC Type 1: Stock that I am profitable on and want to keep in my portfolio.  I am selling OTM here hopefully enough to keep the stock.  If I get assigned and I still believe in the stock at that price I buy it again and start over.  AGAIN NOBODY LOSES MONEY TAKING A PROFIT.\n\n3) CC Type 2: Stock that I used to believe in or still believe in long term but I am in the red.  This is where my DTE can get up to the 180 days.  I am looking for the highest %\/day premium available.  My only goal here is either breaking even or profiting and exiting the stock to redeploy capital.  I have been fortunate to not need to be in this position for more than about three months on any stock so far but very well could be shoveling dirt out of a hole for much longer.  There ins another strategy I also use here which is cost averageing down and selling and shorter term DTE to exit. \n\nI am currently doing this on SLI. I decided I wanted lithium exposure exactly 15 days before a proposed class action lawsuit against them.  I started at 9.84 cost average.  Sold my normal call that was straight to in the money and wanted more stock so I sold a put.  The next day the trend was down for no reason. Stock continued the fall and I closed my call at normal profits and was assigned on the put.  New cost average 9.17.\n\nI have sold two more calls to average down to 8.76 but then the stock got hammered again.  I want out so I purchased 200 more shares and averaged down to 7.855.  I then sold 4 calls at 7.5 april 14 for 440 total premium averaging down to 6.755.  Ar this point as long as the stock maintains 6.76 or better though expiration I get out of this trade only losing time.  In a perfect world 4\/14 rolls around and the stock closes at 8.59.  Oh and if it goes to 5 I will chase it again until  I believe the stock is done and take my bruises."}
{"question":"More or less all stock prices have been continously falling for the last week, if not longer. The housing market sees skyrocketing prices, the price on food, gas and electricity is increasing, and subsequently the consumer spending index drops. All of this leads to an increase in inflation.\n\nAre we going to see a stock market crash and financial crisis, like the ones in 1929 and 2008? Or are things different this time?\n\nAlso, should I personally be worried that I'm not going to be able to get a job, and afford stuff like a house and a normal standard of living, once I've finished my education in 5-6 years?","answer":"1929 and 2008 were both financial crises, which doesn’t just mean “a very bad recession” but actually has a specific meaning.\n\n1929 initially started as a market decline on a similar path to todays (though on a much shakier ground because of lack of regulation). When the market did decline, however, the Federal Reserve made all the wrong moves, abandoning credit lines and causing a moderate recession to turn into a bad one. This bad recession caused a domino effect-like bank runs because savings weren’t protected. Combined with some natural issues (like the dust bowl) this turned a bad recession into a depression. \n\nThis would not happen today because every person with a minor in Econ knows this is the exact opposite of how the Fed should behave, and we have policies in place to prevent things like bank runs. \n\n2008 was the result of a fundamentally flawed credit market, one that could have absolutely brought down the entire world and probably be worse than 1929. Luckily, we learned the lessons of 1929 and the Fed acted much more aggressively-chairman Ben Bernanke got the nickname “Helicopter Ben” because he circled over the economy injecting stimulus in it. This walked us back and turned a potentially catastrophic Greater Depression into an extremely strong recession. \n\nOur speculation is worth what you paid for it, but to most economists the fear is more like a late ‘70s\/early ‘80s stagflationary environment than 1929 or 2008. Supply chain shocks and high inflation a financial crisis has not yet made.\n\nAs far as timing goes, there’s no point speculating in what things will look like 5 or 6 years from now. 5 years is an eternity in an economic cycle."}
{"question":"I know what a loss leader strategy is. There are plenty of articles explaining what it is but none that explain how a corporation determines when loss leaders are worth it.\n\nThey probably know an opportunity cost exists for not offering their loss leaders but how do they calculate what it is?  Can they test two locations with and without the loss leader (but how do they control for numerous other factors)? Can they compare YoY numbers (but what if those organically increases YoY)? \n\nPublic companies are especially interesting because they are legally obligated to maximize profits so how can any policies besides cost cutting and increasing margins be enacted much less kept around?\n\nThanks for your insight.","answer":"You basically answered the question yourself. There are a bunch of ways to measure if a loss leader is worth the cost, none of which are perfect. If we introduce $5 chickens in this store, does that increase overall sales in this particular store? To know if the increase is because of the loss leader or just because of natural sales growth, you compare that store with other similar stores where you did't introduce the loss leader (A\/B Testing). Yes, you have to control for numerous factors, but that's always true in empirical research. \n\nIf you're a company like Costco, you've got a ton of stores, so it's pretty easy. Pick a representative sample of a bunch of stores and put them in group \"A.\" That's the control. Pick another, similarly representative sample of stores, and introduce the treatment condition (the loss leader). That's group \"B.\" Compare the sales from Group A with the sales from Group B and, if you did a good job picking similar stores for each group, you've got your conclusion. \n\nCompanies are generally trying to maximize profits, but that doesn't mean they can't experiment. Otherwise, how would they know if it's a good idea to introduce a new product, raise prices, etc.?"}

{"question":"I may be wrong about this, but why does it seem like there is a conflict of interest between what's best for individual finance vs the economy? For example, it's best for a person to live frugally and use the most money to invest (education, health, retirement, etc.); whereas, it's better for the economy if everybody spends all of their money on not just essential but also luxurious goods. A society where people save more than they spend is a deflationary one. Likewise, a society where people invest more than they spend would probably cause a market bubble since more people buying a company's stock than it's product just drives its PE ratio through the roof\n\nAnother example is having kids is expensive. It's best for a poor couple to not have kids or only one if they want to get out of poverty as fast as possible. However, in economics, every couple should have 2 kids to sustain the future workforce and consumer spending.","answer":"I am very tired and happened to come across this moments before heading to bed, but felt obligated to provide some sort of response. So forgive potential incoherency or sloppiness on my part. \n\nI don't believe this characterization of the economy is remotely accurate in any meaningful way. When individuals do not spend money, they save it. Often that money is saved in a bank or they buy stocks. Banks will take that money, and because they wish to earn a profit, they will often invest it into firms they believe will net them the highest return while trying to minimize risk. Firms receive this money from banks and stock issuances and will allocate those funds into investments they believe will net them the highest return while minimizing risk. \n\nThere's always some sort of tradeoff between consuming more today and trying to invest more to maximize societal welfare, which is what economists really care about when studying 'the economy' rather than something like GDP - which just happens to be one reasonable way to measure this. Market economies seem to be pretty good at striking that balance on their own, and to the extent there is underinvestment in the future relative to immediate consumption, it generally has more to do with potentially great risks involved in successful R&amp;D than an aversion to investing in the future per se.\n\nThere are also certain instances like recessions where people do in fact consume at levels below societal welfare maximization as a consequence from panic, excess unemployment, etc, and it makes sense for the government to step in and help close that gap with monetary and fiscal stimulus. However, that does not mean the 'economy' or individuals would be better if in normal times the government continually stepped in and tried to boost consumer spending, even if that would still theoretically increase GDP in the short term.\n\n&gt; A society where people save more than they spend is a deflationary one. Likewise, a society where people invest more than they spend would probably cause a market bubble since more people buying a company's stock than it's product just drives its PE ratio through the roof\n\nI am not well-read on this matter, but intuitively I do not think it makes much sense or am personally aware of anything empirical to support these claims. Investment is also still a form of spending, albeit one where the payoff is less immediate than consumption. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon."}
{"question":"Are we still in a bubble? It seems like housing takes several years of a person's income to be able to afford, putting people in debt for maybe decades at a time.

Probably they will resume distributing money to the unemployed.

After all, the landlords still have costs to pay like mortgages and repairs. Many landlords in the US are small-time and only own one or two properties. So, I expect an end to that and some sort of welfare for renters.\n\nLike HOU I'm not convinced that there will be so many extra evictions. Even if there are, a house price crash is not certain.

{"question":"Hello fatFIRE,\n\nI am in my 30s and in the lucky position to have founded a unicorn tech startup ($1b+ valuation). \n\nMy personal equity ownership in it brings me to a high net worth. Googling my unique surname would allow anybody that knows my name to connect the dots based on industry articles.\n\nAs I live in the western world in a mostly safe city, I'm not concerned about this at home, but I am becoming more concerned about traveling. In the past, I would have just grabbed my backpack and travelled through South America or Asia by myself. But over the years read enough about stuff like bad actors getting name lists of flights or hotels to then find valuable targets to kidnap\/blackmail\/... to be worried.\n\nHow do other fatFIREs handle personal safety, especially when traveling? Is this a concern? Am I just too worried? Better not travel to such places? Take a bodyguard (weird feeling)?\n\nThanks.","answer":"Corporate Security\/Intel guy and former director of a HNW-client travel security company. Basically it depends entirely on your destination, personal exposure and risk tolerance. Thinking about your security definitely doesn't mean you are being \"too worried\": you're just conducting an ad hoc risk assessment, and by thinking about these things you are already overcoming the biggest threat to most people's personal security: complacency. Most people don't face these issues so we are somewhat normalised to assume that it isn't needed.\n\nThat said, having personal security is quite an invasive and restrictive thing, so it isn't something to jump into lightly unless you really need it. Also worth noting, having a full time CPO team (bodyguards) is really up at the top end, and it may be more appropriate to consider interim measures such as security-trained drivers, remote location monitoring and regular check-ins, and emergency evac insurance. Proactive destination assessments are also always worth considering so that you can tailor your defensive posture for each destination. You might not need a CPO in London, but you might in Sao Paulo.\n\nI also have a distinctive name which annoyingly links anyone googling me to the sale amount of my company, my parent's company figures (also FAT, same name), and other details that I am still working on scrubbing down. The concern I have is that in parts of the developing world with sophisticated K&amp;R gangs, this sort of target research does happen.\n\nHappy to chat via DM if you want pointing to some resources\/reputable companies, or just want some general travel safety advice."}

Now, we all have access to so much information about whatever company we want to research.  I never invested before the internet, but I bet many people then never read earnings reports, or read the financial statements, mainly because they just weren't easily available.  So the \"average\" investor to Buffett may be someone like this.\n\nNow, I can look at the numbers just like him or anyone else.  I can look at the company, its products, its financials, its management, its future plans, etc., and I can decide what I think it's worth.  I think we are at less of a disadvantage to the financial gurus than most of us would realize.  \n\nI also think that investing in individual stocks is valuable, in and of itself, because it forces you to learn more about business, technology, financials, and really just the world as a whole.  The more you learn, the better you become.  You should always try to be learning in life and I think that investing in individual stocks is one good way to do that.\n\nEveryone is going to have their own investing style and I am not criticizing folks who want to have an all index fund portfolio.  There's plenty of evidence that that is a really good approach.  But I think they are missing out on the learning, and potentially on the outsized gains, that can come with researching a stock."}

Note that this is my experience as someone who has invested in California, USA.  I originally put High risk, but have downgraded it to Medium-high risk.  When I put \"high\", I was considering a lot of things that involve work, but if you're willing to put the work in to stay on top of things, then the risk is mitigated.  Also, when I first started in real estate, I heard many horror stories from family friends (lawsuits, massive las vegas market crash 800k property -&gt; 200k, tenants wrecking home, etc).  There are also insurances out there for natural disasters, but it's still a risk, depending on location.  Also the headache from evictions and potential conflict from kicking someone out of their home is far greater than anything you'd see in stocks.  You are dealing with humans here and that means skills that would otherwise not be needed in personal investing.  The chances of these bad things happening are low, certainly in the single digits, but they exist.\n\nOn a macro scale, generally it is quite stable, however, just like how stock markets can have big downswings, so can real estate markets.  Granted, it is very rare for a real estate market not to recover, and you can usually depend on the value continuing to go up.\n\nAnd some have asked how a person with $30k USD can get into real estate.  Back in 2012, I put $25k down on a $125k condominium, had another 6-7k in closing costs, and took a 15 year mortgage out on the rest.  The rent paid was able to cover the mortgage (and then some), and since then, the value of the property has doubled to $250k.  Most major metropolitan markets are certainly past the $125k range now, but it just depends on where you live.\n\nEDIT: The interest rates I've stated are for the US and the current rates.  The rates can change.  All rates are what you can generally expect in the market right now.  If you find higher yield bank accounts, CHECK THE FEES."}

{"question":"It seems to me that one of wealth's hidden powers is the quiet avoidance of conflict.\n\nExample: City wants to use eminent domain to put in a new road. The city can either go after the property of 20 poor families, or three very rich ones. In fact, the road would work better going through the property of the three rich families, but the city chooses the 20 poor family's properties to avoid a significant legal delay. \n\nThis cost the rich families exactly zero to avoid this conflict, and there are many more examples of the rich facing less consequences\/confrontations just by being rich. The mere threat of what a rich person can do can be enough for them to avoid a confrontation.\n\nHas this economic feature of wealth been articulated or studied?","answer":"Can you first articulate your theory about why \"the City\" would make this choice in the first place? I am having a hard time understanding the logic about why the 20 would be so much easier. I'm assuming you are talking about the US; otherwise, the law will be different.\n\nPoint 1: You mention \"going after the property\" of the 20 poor families-- but if they are that poor, they don't own the property, they rent it. So, they are going against the **landlords** of 20 properties, versus the owners\/possible occupants of 3. Dealing with 20 landlords seems at least as difficult as dealing with 3 \"rich people\".\n\nPoint 2: Winning an eminent domain case against the government is a 1 in 1,000 shot in the dark, and expensive at that. Very few people with sense would fight it-- instead you want to hire a lawyer to negotiate the best settlement possible, not to fight it. These rich people with good lawyers will get good advice, and start shopping for or designing their new house right away.\n\n&gt;The mere threat of what a rich person can do can be enough for them to avoid a confrontation.\n\nPoint 3: What can the rich person do? Unless they are Bill Gates, the city has more resources; sadly, they also have the law on their side, given the ever-expanding scope allowed for government takings in recent years. I don't agree with how it has expanded to include \"building warehouses just because some business needs them\", but well over 99% of the time you will lose.\n\nPoint 4: Eminent domain doesn't take the property for free, the city still must pay fair market value-- sometimes even more than that (according to the \"highest and best use\" of the property) plus moving expenses. These 20 houses on average would need to be worth 1\/7th the amount of the others.\n\nPoint 5: Why the rush?

{"question":"Just as the header says; Best Canadian dividend stocks to hold forever?\n\nI have a few I have done some dd on a few I like, but I would love to hear what some fellow investors are a fan of and why.\n\nThanks for any feedback and enjoy the rest of your Sunday y’all !","answer":"Buy divided paying companies that have low dividend payout ratios (EPS and \/ or FFO), decent growth rates and yield.  Too high of dividend yield may indicate a dividend cut is imminent and too low may indicate it's over valued.\n\nIf you want a less risky portfolio, choose companies or sectors that have a competitive advantage like:\n\nUtilities, telcos - regulated by public utilities commissions. Remember a utility is a monopoly. Who doesn't like a dividend paying monopoly that is protected from competiton by regulators and can recover most losses (PG&amp;E is an example of how a utility should not be run).  \n\nBig 6 banks- regulated, can't merge together, oligopoly, and you can bet if a Canadian bank collapses, the feds will bail them out because of the systematic risk they pose to the economy\n\nRails - regulated, can't merge , oligopoly \n\nInflation advantage - one of the things I like about the banks is they benefit from inflation (stable, not hyperinflation).  When things cost more, people borrow more, when people borrow more, banks earn more interest income which translates into higher bank earnings and dividends. Ask yourself, which companies have such a natural advantage without risk of losing a large number  customers or risk seeing a large demand reduction.  \n\nContracted, take or pay - companies that have a stable cash flow stream because they have  contracted operations with quality counterparties.  Typically midstream, IPPs, REITs.  Be mindful though of the underlying risk of their counterparties as you are taking their business risk exposure.  \n\nFranchise advantage: companies that have some sort of or combination of franchise, regulatory, competitive advantage that is very hard to disrupt or replicate.  I would classify the LIfecos\/ big pipelines in this bucket.  \n\nRisk: dividend investing has risks.  Understand and get comfortable with your level of risk.  Once you do that, then you do the next form of pyramid dividend investing (no I am not talking of a multi-level scam or ponzi scheme)\n\nEDIT: why dont't I buy ETFs?  Dividend ETFs are great if you're a hands off investor, don't have the time to do the research or manage your portfolio, don't trust yourself to make the right decision so you want professionals to do it, or find it just easier.  If you fit into any of those categories, stop reading because you won't like my answer next.\n\nI manage my own portfolio because none of the above reasons apply to me.  Dividend investing is my side hustle.   I also don't want to pay a MER for something I can do myself.  A friend asked why I don't buy the Canadian bank ETF for ease?  For the simple reason I can buy all 6 major banks and avoid the MER.   Also I like the flexibility of getting the cash from the dividends to invest in other growth stocks or for personal use \nI"}

{"question":"I've been following the news surrounding Evergrande. Some analyst say that the company going down could have catastrophic outcomes across China and the rest of the world.  They've equated to Lehman brothers in 2008 (which I don't understand). \n\nHow is it that the bankruptcy of a single company could have those far reaching effects across an economy as large as China, US or the world?","answer":"Usually the companies in question are major financial entities that lend money to other companies and hold others' investments. So if they collapse it triggers losses, and often a lack of access to cash, in other companies as well. Called a \"liquidity crisis\" because companies will lack cash flow to pay immediate Bill's due to the shock, and be forced to sell assets... which triggers economic contraction and expands the problem. \n\nHowever - In 2008, Lehman and Bear Stearns were the first to collapse, but they weren't the only ones. They were a symptom of a broader collapse in the US subprime mortgage market that caused a liquidity crunch in a large number of financial institutions - which  all sold the mortgages, insured them through another branch of the same company, and repackaged the mortgages into securities that they sold on the open market. (Plus, it was real estate values collapsing, which cut into consumer credit access because of home equity loans, triggered foreclosures, plummeted demand for new construction, etc.)\n\nEvergrande - and even Lehman - weren't big enough to do that on their own. But often when one collapses, investors start panicking and looking around at other, similar companies- driving up borrowing costs, etc. or suddenly responding en masse to a problem that was bubbling under the surface for a long time.\n\nTo understand financial crises more, and 2008 in particular, I'd recommend looking into Robert Shiller's work on herd mentality\/irrationality in investment, and maybe at some of Nouriel Roubini's work on how financial crises operate. You might also look at something like Paul Blustein's \"The Chastening\" for a more approachable journalistic treatment of the 1997-8 asian crisis that shared important similarities with 2008."}

I'll do my best to answer anything I'm able to - I've been working in markets for a long time now (17 years!) and have been pushing for regulatory reforms since 2012 when I testified before the Senate Banking Committee. We recently launched an effort to build a grassroots advocacy campaign at [we-the-investors.org](http:\/\/we-the-investors.org) and I'm excited for the opportunity to help retail advocate on its own behalf.","answer":"There is a man, Dr. Jim Decosta, who spent 24 years of his life devoted to exposing corruption in our financial system. No one really knows what has happened to him, but in honor of him I want to know if you are aware of his findings. He has made countless comments to the SEC like [this](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/proposed\/s72303\/decosta122203.htm), which have unsurprisingly resulted in nothing.\n\nOne of the biggest revelations from his work is the notion that major institutions such as Fidelity or Vanguard loan out shares that are held in retirement accounts for their own benefit and the detriment of those holders' positions. There is little risk to them to do this, since these positions are typically held for decades per the nature of these accounts. This is explicitly illegal, yet there is (as close as we will get as bystanders) almost proof that this occurs.\n\nWith the disappearance of most pensions, the massive tax benefits these accounts provide for hopeful retirees, company matching programs, and the fact that you have to use the firm that your workplace selects, workers are practically forced into using these accounts to save for retirement. Thus they are forced to purchase shares which are then illegally lent out without their permission, potentially hurting the value of their own investments, while not sharing any of the interest from said lending.\n\nI want to ask you what you think about this scheme and if you would be interested in helping to track down Dr. Jim Decosta for further discussion."}

Likely some of the better educated folks in the sub will provide a more nuanced and complete answer. \n\nConfidence the US has the ability to pay back loans matters. Best evidence is investors care about debt to GDP ratios, not nominal debt. If this is the case, any borrowing that has a rate of return above one, will reduce this ratio. If you can borrow a dollar, and it produces more than a dollar's worth of GDP, you've reduced the debt to GDP ratio.  \n\nOpportunity cost matters as well. Right now, there are very few low risk investment opportunities. This is true to such an extent that people are willing to accept a negative interest rate for the safety of US treasuries. It's literally free to borrow right now.  As an aside, hopefully all redeemable treasuries are now being paid off with new borrowing. \n\nAs far as I know, economists do not agree on any particular debt to GDP ratio as an upper limit.  That's not to say there isn't one, but that it's fact and circumstance dependent, and we don't know what it is for sure. \n\n* CBO on debt: https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/publication\/56309\n\n* Reinhardt and Rogan trying to quantify upper limits of debt to GDP ratios: https:\/\/mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de\/24376\/1\/MPRA_paper_24376.pdf\n\nJust two other things. First, Peter Schiff has been saying the same thing for almost two decades now, and he has never been correct.  He's not an economist and he's not a first-rate investor. second, there is no threat of inflation looming on the horizon that we can measure in any way at this point. Perhaps there will be a time when inflation takes off, and the monetary supply will need to be restricted. That's different than debt.\n\nEconomists do agree debt can get out of control and cause problems: http:\/\/www.igmchicago.org\/surveys\/high-debt-countries\/ \nEconomist generally do not agree that the core tenets of MMT hold all the time and everywhere: http:\/\/www.igmchicago.org\/surveys\/modern-monetary-theory\/"}

{"question":"Buffett and Munger have shown that low-cost index funds trump hedge funds over the long term. Yet people keep giving to hedgies. Why? Does the “prestige” of investing with a hedge fund overrule the logic of going with Vanguard?","answer":"Hedge funds firstly are unavailable to common investors like you or I, the big dogs take clients with massive net worths. The whole point of a “hedge” fund is to provide uncorrelated returns to the broader market. Not necessarily to beat the markets return itself. You might ask, why anyone would want to take the lower returns? It’s because some of these super high net worth individuals care more about having a hedge against huge market downturns and black swan events. Essentially it’s a another tool in the tool box to help diversify their portfolio. If a HF manager can provide me 6% returns on average, even though that’s lower than the average of the index they will be uncorrelated so it provides me a safety net. Some of it has to do with client interaction and the associated prestige but most of the inflow into HF is, well for, hedging."}

{"question":"Instead of lowering interest rates, the federal reserve could send money to people directly to set inflation targets and skip the middle man altogether (banks and federal government).","answer":"If the fed made direct payments to public, it would be creating liabilities (new base money) without increasing its assets. This is bad because if inflation were to rise, the central bank  may not have sufficient amount of assets to sell (sales destroy base money) to control inflation. So “helicopter money” (what some economists call direct payments by the fed to the public) may lead to an inability to control inflation.

Billionaires aren't dragons. They don't sit on piles of cash. The wealth they have is largely invested. And at the very least compared to a world where this wealth wouldn't exist, this invested capital ultimately contributes to productivity growth and higher wages. The savings rate in countries like the US is lower than optimal anyway on aggregate, billionaires spending their money instead of investing it certainly wouldn't make this situation better.\n\n\"Rich people hoarding wealth\" is a political talking point, nothing more. You could certainly talk about ways to improve aggregate welfare through redistribution, like all kinds of progressive taxation schemes, marginal utility of money and all that, but the reason that makes sense is not because rich people just hoard wealth that does nothing for anyone else.\n\nFor the people complaining about comments not showing up, please read the sidebar.

What am I missing?\n\nLove y’all - cheers for the guidance","answer":"TSMC is in Taiwan, not China. China would like  to bring Taiwan back into its control, but it can never actually do anything about it. Any military adventure would be a massive disaster.\n\n1. See Okinawa for how horrifically bloody amphibious operations are, then multiply by at least 10x for the 12x larger Taiwan with 50 times the population.\n2. Adjust for the fact the Japanese defenders had zero resupply, and allies totally dominated air and sea with 30 carriers alone for the operation. By contrast three of the top ten militaries will offer direct support to Taiwan (#1 US, #5 Japan, and South Korea), resupply cannot be stopped, and Taiwan has a first world Air-force and thousands of anti-ship and anti-air missiles. Its also the 7th largest military by active soldiers.\n3. Even if successful, China would never capture any TSMC tech intact and all the key engineers would escape off island. It can only gain a smoking ruin that would require dealing with a long insurgency.\n4. Any conflict closes the south china sea and in combination with sanctions cuts China off from free trade leading to a Chinese depression and possibility of mass unrest that would threaten the hold of the CCP.\n5. Lastly, TSMC and other Taiwanese semiconductor makers are building plants in the US and other countries.\n\nTSMC has a massive moat Intel is unlikely to ever be able to breach.\n\n1. TSMC has the lead in most advanced volume processes, it 's starting volume 3 nm production this year. It has a two process size lead on Intel, or about five years.\n2. TSMC is not a competitor to its customers, a big reason it got Apples business was that Apple didn't trust Samsung and moved all its production to TSMC as soon as it proved worthy. Those massive volumes enabled TSMC to build the highest manufacturing efficiencies in the industry.\n3. So if Intel can catch up in process size, somehow they have to convince their direct competitors such as AMD, nVidia, Apple, Samsung, etc to buy capacity. The only way to do that is to offer massive discounts over what TSMC charges, if pricing is similar everyone will happily say FU Intel.\n\nLastly there is a massive amount of investment in semiconductor fabs due to the COVID triggered supply chain issues and stimulus driven demand surge from last year. This has led to widespread shortages, so Intel, TSMC, and others are pouring hundreds of billions into new plants.\n\nThe problem with this is that semiconductors are extremely cyclical due to massively long lead times. Investment today doesn't lead to new plants for two to three years minimum, so many things can change before they even know if the investment was worthwhile. Typically what happens is overinvestment until a glut happens, and then underinvesment again until shortages re-appear.\n\nCurrently it looks like a glut within the next 2-3 years appears likely.\n\n1. Investment is based on demand that was unusually large due to stimulus last year. Some of that probably led to double ordering to try to work around long lead times.\n2. PC sales have been in decline for a decade but spiked last year. Now they are declining again.\n3. Server demand also spiked the last two years at an unsustainable rate. As lockdowns end its likely demand returns to historic growth patterns, or even has a few years of slow growth to rebalance to normal demand levels.\n4. We are likely entering a recession that will further diminish demand across the board.\n\nTSMC should be able to navigate the cycles better than anyone else because of its higher production volumes and efficiencies, and because it's a neutral partner of choice while Samsung and Intel are viewed as untrustworthy competitors."}

{"question":"I see a lot of complaints online about boomers holding on to the majority of the wealth and the younger generations are getting shafted without a way to build their wealth. I find this (static view) hard to believe, as the boomers can't really take their wealth beyond the grave, and the younger generation will have to, by definition, acquire wealth that is passed on in due time. Is this not the case? Why are some millennials complaining when the boomer wealth simply \\_must go somewhere\\_ in a few decades?\n\nAssuming boomers cannot take wealth beyond grave, where do the money actually go? Is there a study of how wealth transfers across generation due to the passing of members of the older generation? Do they mostly get gobbled up by family, or government, or the real-estate market?

{"question":"The logic of privatising holds up in my opinion but not in the USA when it come to healthcare. Essentially if you make 100 k a year you can get taxed 40% of that and have a lot of public services leaving you with 60 k or it can be privatised and you get taxed 20% and you have 80k of dispensable savings and because of competition between companies  you will only pay 10k for those healthcare companies and thus leaving you with more money overall at 70k. For healthcare it seems though nationalising it would be cheaper as I have seen some drug prices that cost maybe a dollar to make be charged for 700 dollars. Why isn't there competition and a race to the bottom when it comes to prices for these?","answer":"Econtalk had a podcast regarding this. I think that would help explain part of the reason. One point there is that hospitals do not compete exactly the way other firms do. Can you compare and have access to the cost of all the different facilities in your nearby hospitals. I would presume that you can't, and that's a big part of the problem. For most of the hospitals, their consumers are the insurance companies and the govn, this makes the insurance companies really powerful in the usa. There are just two many incentives to showing a higher price than it really is.\n\nAlso, there are a few theories that tell us that a few fields in which network effects are enormous (healthcare, sanitation, and education), it makes sense that everyone has free and easy access to those things.

{"question":"I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like the juice isn't worth the squeeze right now.\n\nIn the back of my mind is a pressure to participate meaningfully in society, pay taxes, raise a family, reach the pinnacle of a career etc. But at the same time it feels so out of reach, and uncertain if the effort is worth it at all. Will there be a retirement at the end? Is financial independence a thing of the past? If 2 parents need to work non-stop, why bother having a family? These questions eat at me.\n\nThe other half of me is resigned to working just enough to take care of basic needs, and forego the traditional goals.

That could be responsibility in persuing home ownership or rasing a family or it could be in pursuing a goal for yourself and forgoing the more traditional lifestyle. That goal could be anything, travel, career goals, refining a skill or finding a hobby. \n\nBut it's never going to be in abdicating responsibility entirely. That life leads to resentment and bitterness. You're going to suffer in this life no matter what.

The later you leave it the less choice you will have in what it is you'll suffer for, but suffer you will.\n\nI chose family life. I am tight with my family and I want that later in life also with my kids. With that comes certain pressures to provide.

{"question":"When either rehabbing a property to make it rent ready, or just generally upkeeping it during turnover, what flooring materials, paints, cabinets, etc, do you trust and use most often? I'm putting together a list of materials to make decision making easier down the road and I'd like the opinions of those of you who are seasoned and have real experience with specific materials (vinyl flooring types and brands, laminate, tile, faucets, light fixtures, what-have-you). I've looked things over in the store and read their little sales pitches but I'm skeptical of anything a company says about their own product. \"We're the most durable in the business\", \"This paint hides stains and cleans easily\", \"These cabinets are life-proof\". So I'm coming to you guys who have nothing to gain or lose by spilling the best and worst products you've used in your rentals.","answer":"I rehab a few properties a year, most full renovations with and average budget of about 50-70k (though I just finished one that was 135k an entire gut with major structural changes).\n\nThis question is super location specific (like neighborhood specific). Where I invest, in a midsized East Coast city (Pittsburgh), B+\/- City neighborhoods, I am able to use higher end finishes, hit the top tier of rent, and still stay within 70% ARV (many areas \/neighborhoods of my city don’t allow for anything over builder grade finishes, But I stay out of those. Some neighborhoods are very expensive and the cap rate and cash flow are terrible, I stay out of those for the most part too). Most of my renovations are single-family homes and I hold them as rentals (brrrr), though I also mess with small mf. The average house I do is a purchase price of around 60K, and an ARV of about 150-175k that brings in an average of ~$1650\/month in rent (where the overall market average is ~$1100\/month for properties that aren’t updated). I guess it’s a little harder for me to find properties because my renovations cost a little more and I’m always very conservative in my numbers. But I’d rather be slow and profitable than fast and broke.\n\nI use higher end finishes (rather than builder grade) because they wear better, I can command a higher rent, and a subsequently get more qualified renters, usually young professionals, so I weed out a lot of the riffraff. I’ve never had an evection we’ll put it that way..\n\nI don’t like carpet, I typically go for hardwood floors, in my city a lot of the housing stock is 100 years old and all have hardwood floors that have been protected by carpet for decades that I am able to refinish. If I’m not I typically use oak or walnut 5 inch wide planks for main living areas, and will sometimes carpet bedrooms. I use LVP in basement bathrooms.\n \n**don’t ever buy flooring from lumber liquidators, whatever you do, go anywhere else. They are unscrupulous, with multiple class action lawsuits to prove it. Don’t lose your money into them**\n\nI use white subway tile (4”x12”) for shower and bath tub surrounds which I almost always tile, rather than getting the cheap acrylic surround. It really makes a big difference in the final look. \n\nI use white subway tile (3”x6”) for the backsplash in the kitchen too. I get the more expensive grout that doesn’t require a sealer and usually A light gray or beige shade. I’ve had issues with stained grout in rentals.\n\nI use tile for the bathroom floors, and recently have been using the hexagon marble sheets. It’s a little expensive, but in a 30-40 square-foot bathroom it’s not that bad and it looks super high end. Otherwise I use ceramic or porcelain large format tile.\n\nI buy ForeverMark cabinets (and accompanying crown molding and trim), varying colors depending on the look of the rehab. It’s all ply construction (no particle board garbage), and they’re well-made for cheaper cabinets.\n\nI always install granite or quartz countertops, for the cost (1-2K) It’s always worth it. A go for the granite that’s on sale though usually are around $30-$35 per square foot.\n\nI get all stainless steel appliances, usually cheap range, dishwasher, microwave, and I’ll spend up to $1000 on a fridge (Pro tip, always get the extended warrantee offered on the fridge. The rest of the appliances don’t matter, but the fridge does. They usually cost $80-$100, and will Save your butt. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a fridge break right after the year mark of the factory warranty LOL.)\n\nI go for all wood vanities (if I can find them, and I get the cheapest I can find, usually about $400) and matching vanity mirrors. I do everything I can to stay away from things that are made out of particleboard and mdf.\n\nI get midrange plumbing fixtures (usually moen, Either brushed nickel or rubbed bronze depending on the look of the rehab). You should find a plumbing supplier around you. Big box stores carry the same plumbing fixtures, but they’re made differently and they’re cheaper. The components inside, the gaskets, are typically plastic. The ones from the plumbing supply store have rubber, ceramic, and metal components. They’ll also have shut off valves integral in the shower diverter. That means you don’t need An access panel behind them, you just takeoff the face plate and you can shut off the water to repair. It’s usually a A little more expensive, but worth it to not be paying a plumber to come replace them. You need to have shut off valves on all plumbing Fixtures, so if it’s in a spot where you can’t have an access panel, it allows you to meet code. I use delta foundations toilets that are about $150\n\nFor bedrooms and main areas I use the 13” flush mount edge lit lights (if we didn’t put in recessed lighting). I get cheap lantern style LED lights for the exterior. I will usually get a nicer fixture for an entryway or kitchen (If it doesn’t have recessed cans) But I wont spend over $70 on that. That’s one of those things that is an eyecatcher. I get whatever vanity flights are the cheapest but fit the look. I usually spend about $30-$40 on vanity lights.\n\nI get the 5 1\/4 inch baseboard, quarter round, and 3 1\/2 inch window and door casings.\n\nI usually add AC if it doesn’t have one, or add a furnace and AC if it has an old boiler system. Its worth the cost to me. I’ve been putting in Goodman furnaces and AC, which are significantly cheaper than Lennox and carrier, But have a good warranty and perform well.\n\nI use Sherwin-Williams paints (I have a pro account with them and get their 200 line for about the same cost as the house brands of big box stores, and it’s far superior) and do an eggshell flat white ceiling, beige, gray or light blue walls, and Swiss coffee for trim.\n\nAbout 3\/4 of the time I need to put in new windows. I get the cheapest vinyl replacement windows that usually cost about $166 each (though they cost more if I need it to be obscured or tempered). I get them installed and the exterior capped for about $100-$130 each.\n\nI use faux-wood 2” plantation style blinds. Cost between $25 and $45 each. Very durable and look fantastic.\n\nI use timberline or BP Everest architectural shingles for roofs. Roofs usually cost about $400-450\/square depending on the roof and site conditions.\n\nI often use a (cheap) nice fiberglass shaker with 6-pane window front door that are usually about $350 at Lowe’s, And the stock steel half light exterior doors for anything else.\n\nI put a keypad deadlock on every house. Makes letting contractors in, and changing tenants, a breeze.\n\nIf I need to do stair railing’s, I use a wrought iron interior pre-fabricated railing. I found a local guy who has a forge. The average cost is about $500, it’s not only cheaper than buying railing, balusters, Newell posts, etc. It also saves a massive amount of labor (he welds stock steel together, Paints it with a black enamel, and spends 15 minutes bolting it in), and I think it looks much better\/cleaner. It’s much more sturdy as well.\n\nFor decks and exterior railings I always just use treated lumber. But with the cost of treated lumber right now, it’s almost comparable to using trex composite decking, so I may switch that up.\n\nThere’s a bunch of stuff I’m forgetting and every rehab is different, but those are the major things. I’ll add more if I think of it.\n\nAgain, this is super location specific. I’m able to do tile and nicer floors, and not have to buy builder grade cabinets, because my rehabs will allow for the extra cost. I do spend a *significant* amount of time getting materials, Working with contractors and shopping around to make sure that I’m staying in Budget.\n\nEdit: not materials, but definitely renovation cost related. I recently bought a 5 x 10 dump trailer. I’ll still get large dumpsters for the demo if we need it, but then I’m able to park that dump trailer out front, I don’t have to get permits, and I’m not getting charged per day for a dumpster. So when it’s just for excess material from the renovation, it saves me a lot of money. Around me a 12 yard dumpster cost about $450 for 2 tons of material and seven days of use. After that you start getting charged $15 a day, and for any overage on the tonnage. It really adds up.\n\nSomeone asked for pictures, here are a few post-renovation pics of the big one I’m finishing, Since these pictures were taken we put decorative grasses in the front, painted the front porch, and appliances are in.  https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/SUvkWRa\n\nStreet view from pre-renovation https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/GUAThm8"}

Low top marginal tax rates is a large factor in why those salaries are uniquely American, and are not present in other OECD countries. \n\nClaudia Goldin and Lawerence Katz’s book The Race Between Education and Technology is another good source in the increase in salaries of high skilled workers, but won’t directly address your question."}
{"question":"Hi,\n\nI work in a cyber security related role and so I know cybersecurity professionals like having crypto as a hobby.\n\nWith all these new alt-coins about like Doge coin which ones are even investing in?\n\nIs it still even investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum?\n\nThanks","answer":"Personally, I would suggest at least a small allocation to your portfolio. Crypto is starting to be seen as an emerging asset rather than speculative one. Although projects like Dogecoin don’t help with that progress, there are plenty of projects that have real world applications and is why more big players are taking an interest in allocating into the market. It’s highly volatile and high risk, and you have to avoid the common emotional reaction to common large dips and general market cycles. Just my opinion."}

{"question":"I’m in a microeconomic class right now and I feel like all of this would be so much easier\/intuitive\/effective if we used calculus. Elasticity, marginal benefit, everything. There’s no way this can be used in the real world without calculus right?  Why isn’t the class taught with calculus in mind.","answer":"Because you can teach the intuition behind almost all microeconomic concepts without an actual knowledge of calculus.\n\nAnd fundamentally that's the most important thing people should take away from their first micro course.  They aren't going to remember how to use a lagrange multiplier to to solve for a consumer's optimal bundle of goods 10 years later (hell, I'm a professional \"economist\" and I'd fail my calc-based ECON200 midterm exam if you made me take it today)...but if you can teach them to think in terms of scarcity, costs\/benefits, supply\/demand, and still remember some of the big takeaways 10 years later, then you have won.  \n\nThat said, some universities will let you do an entire econ degree without requiring calculus.  I think that takes it too far.  Learning the intuition behind elasticity and marginal benefits without calculus is totally possible, but if you want to go deeper (like getting a degree), you need the tools.  Also, you kind of need calc for macro.  You can sneak your way through the basics by teaching some very basic calc and just having people memorize the formula for some simple derivatives (basically just memorize the derivatives of cobb-douglas) and you can teach a pretty decent macro course, but beyond a 101 course I think that's insufficient.\n\nAnecdotally, I'll offer two observations.\n\n1. When I did my undergrad, it was optional to take the true intro micro\/macro classes before diving into the 200-level degree-required courses that were heavy on math and absolutely required calculus.  There was a noticeable difference between the kids who took the \"suggested\" 100-level classes (very well taught but no calculus, all intuition-driven, multiple choice exams, etc.) and the kids who dove right into the major requirements.  A lot of kids who skipped the 100s really struggled with economic intuition.  They could do the calculus and solve the equations, but the 200s classes spent so much time on math that it was hard to develop \"big picture\" intuition on how the concepts came together without some prior background.\n2. Best micro class I ever took was the hardest of the 3 micro options offered during my MBA--so called \"turbo micro\".  It was taught by Kevin Murphy and was essentially the first part of the UChicago PhD Price Theory (micro) course but with all of the calculus\/hard math stripped out (because you know, MBAs can't do math).  Like literally same exam questions that PhD students would get--there's a study guide floating around with past answers from the PhD exam (i'll try to find a link, I got it from PhD friends, but I know it is online)...just ignore any questions with math\/formulas\/calculus and it becomes a study guide for the MBA exam.  The class was 100% intuition and despite having tons of past career\/educational economics experience, I learned an incredible amount from the course.  Learning to *think* like an economist is honestly harder (and more important) than learning basic calculus. In terms of my day-to-day work and thought, that class taught me more than any of the calculus-based classes from my Econ degree."}
{"question":"I've often wondered if there is something I'm missing about how wealth is understood at the billionaire level. Most of their value is not in cash so isn't what they are worth more of an appraisal?\n\nI understand scapegoating billionaires. But I wonder how could we expect them to pay for things when they don't have cash, or with value that isn't real but rather projected. \n\nHow much of the 100 billion in Jeff's worth is translatable to increases in Amazon wages? How would that process work?\n\nI thank you in advance and am not looking for political answers but distinctly economic ones.","answer":"You are correct that the value is similar to an appraisal, but it makes sense to count it that way. If I have $50 in cash, but a $100,000 house, it wouldn't make sense to appraise my net worth at $50, because if I needed to I could liquidate the house and have about $100,000 soon.\n\nSo instead of thinking about it as billionaires paying for things, think about it as the government paying for things and sending billionaires a bill in the form of higher taxes. Sure, they may not have enough cash to pay the whole bill, but they can sell some of their assets to come up with the money soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the part of the question about Jeff paying employees less, it's a bit complicated and multifaceted, so I'll just start at the beginning.\n\nThe most fundamental reason why a person might want to buy a share of a company in the first place is because that ownership portion of the company would eventually start paying them a portion of the profits, also known as a dividend. They get to keep their ownership share which they can sell at any time, and at some point in the future, the company will stop reinvesting all of its profits into the business and start giving some of the profits to the owners. Large financial markets like the stock market are more influenced by speculation than dividends, but the shares wouldn't be worth anything, and speculation would be moot if there wasn't a future expectation of dividends.\n\nProfit = revenue - cost, so companies hoping to maximize profit have an obvious incentive to keep costs like employee salaries low to maximize those profits. Jeff is the CEO, so he gets to decide what his employees will earn.\n\nSince Jeff is also the largest shareholder in his company, his assets would be directly affected by the loss of profit associated with raising wages. If the company no longer has the same ability to generate profits, speculators on the stock market decide it isn't worth as much anymore because its potential to pay future dividends is diminished. They want to sell their shares, but potential buyers also know that the company isn't as capable of producing profits anymore so now buyers are only willing to buy the shares if they can buy them at a lower price. If this happens the stock that Jeff owns isn't worth as much as it once was because if he wanted to liquidate it, he'd have to sell it at a lower price.\n\nSo it's not as if Jeff would be writing checks from his personal bank account to his employees. Instead, Jeff's decision to raise employee wages would cause the assets that he owns to become less valuable, lowering his net worth."}
{"question":"I was in r\/askphilosophy and someone asked whether it was ethical to tip, as while you are helping the individual server, you are helping support a system that means servers get paid below minimum wage in the US.\n\nWhat would the effects of stopping tipping be, and what are the reasons why there isn't more of a drive to change this?\n\n\n\nI am from UK so I think tips should be there to recognise exceptional service.\n\nDon't just say not tipping is for a-holes, just asking about effects, and the economics surrounding tipping.","answer":"Tipping is a surprisingly complex and nuanced phenomenon, from an economics point of view. There are many factors to consider. Does tipping have a significant impact on the quality of service? Does tipping result in higher or lower wages? Does tipping have the benefit of giving customers a sense of control and generosity? Is tipping unfair and inequitable?\n\nThese questions are examined in a recent paper called, [\"The Economics of Tipping\"](https:\/\/pubs.aeaweb.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1257\/jep.34.2.215), and it will do much better justice to these topics than anyone can in a reddit reply. This excerpt from the conclusion will give you a sense of the complexity as well as the lack of economic consensus on the topic:\n\n&gt;Tipping is for obvious reasons a subject of controversy. A social norm that dictates a tip as a percentage of the bill doesn’t seem to make intuitive sense: opening a $100 bottle of wine does not require quadruple the effort of opening a $25 bottle of wine, and bringing a $40 steak is not four times as tiring as bringing a $10 pasta. Critics have argued that tipping enforces archaic and undesirable social distinctions and that it facilitates discrimination in who holds what jobs in a restaurant, as well as encouraging sexual harassment (Ferdman 2016).  A number of writers have expressed a negative attitude towards tipping or even called to abolish it (for example, Porter 2013; Keane 2014; S.K. 2015; Grimminck 2015; Dixon 2016).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The discussion and evidence in this paper suggests a more nuanced view. Perhaps some restaurants, under a certain kind of management and with a certain kind of reputation, could benefit by replacing tipping with a fixed service charge or with higher menu prices. Indeed, some restaurant owners strongly believe that replacing tipping with a fixed service charge, distributed among both servers and kitchen help, led to a better quality of food, improved team spirit, and ultimately resulted in a higher level of professionalism and better service—even if some previously high-tipped servers experienced a fall in income (for example, see Porter 2013).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, at many other restaurants, the social norm of tipping has been reasonably robust. Many customers prefer the control of choosing a tip and have a positive feeling that they are showing generosity. Servers earn more as a result and find that busy shifts where they have to work harder are rewarded with higher income. Service quality seems modestly higher. It seems likely that restaurant owners, tempted by the tip rents being earned by servers, will continue to experiment with ways of recapturing some of those rents—either to redistribute to kitchen workers or to raise profits. Perhaps the self-reinforcing social norm of tipping will be toppled eventually in the United States, but with more than a century of history, it seems unlikely to go quickly."}

{"question":"One of the major arguments against a UBI is that it'll cause inflation. I understand how more people having more money increases demand and therefore raises prices, but would supply not simply rise to meet demand in the long run? Sure the initial shock might cause prices to rise, but would it really cause runaway inflation?\n\nIf the source of inflation is more people having more money, why didn't the prosperity of the 50s cause inflation? Or was it just pushed into the 60s and 70s?\n\nAlso, does this mean that capitalism is structurally incapable of providing everyone with a decent standard of living?","answer":"In the long run, inflation is determined by monetary policy decisions of the central bank. So, a UBI will not generate long-run inflation.\n\nMany of the comments that I didn't approve claim that it depends on whether or not the UBI is funded through deficit spending or taxes (with a deficit-funded UBI leading to inflation and a tax-funded one not). I think it's more accurate to say that a deficit-funded UBI would lead to *inflationary pressure* that the central bank would have to act to offset. But as long as the central bank chooses to keep inflation on target, there would be no inflationary effect (barring short-run errors in monetary policy, but these disappear in the long run). Such a phenomenon is commonly referred to as \"monetary offset\".\n\nThe edge-case here is that if the deficit induced by the UBI is so large that it threatens the solvency of the country. In this case, the government may choose to force the central bank to print money and \"monetize the debt\" which would lead to inflation. Here, the UBI isn't really \"causing\" inflation so-to-speak, but rather is forcing the governments hand to implement a different policy that induces inflation."}

Very intuitive way to think about housing costs. Also a fairly easy (non-technical) read.\n\n&gt;In this essay, we review the basic economics of housing supply and the functioning of US housing markets to better understand the distribution of home prices, household wealth, and the spatial distribution of people across markets. We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax. The available evidence suggests, but does not definitively prove, that the implicit tax on development created by housing regulations is higher in many areas than any reasonable negative externalities associated with new construction. We discuss two main effects of developments in housing prices: on patterns of household wealth and on the incentives for relocation to high-wage, high-productivity areas. Finally, we turn to policy implications."}

{"question":"Upper year Econ major here. I’ve been massively disappointed by most my courses at Uni. They’ve all been so math heavy, not that I hate math (quite the contrary), but it’s always followed by the caveat from the professor that we don’t actually know what any of these values are in real life. So what’s the point of us doing 2 hours of homework solving it then??? \n\nI understanding the utility of mathematical models in validating assumptions and discovering blind spots in our thinking, etc. but why does this mean my learning has to consist of hours of doing calculus with made up values. I fail to see the value. Are these just badly taught courses or is this just what Economics is like? Apart from making the subject matter incredibly boring, I also fail to see the merit of it.\n\nI apologize if this comes off as ignorant, I just feel like I’m losing my mind doing this mind numbing work on a subject I was once deeply interested in.","answer":"As always - check the sidebar FAQs!!!\n\nFrom the '[economic methodology](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_methods)' FAQ:\n\n\n&gt;**Why do economists use complicated math? Do they have physics envy?**\n\n&gt;Economists use models, just like other scientists. Economists formulate models using math because math gives our models clarity and consistency.\n\n&gt;Clarity means you know exactly what a model defines, assumes, and concludes. Marxists are still debating what Marx actually meant. No one debates what Kenneth Arrow actually meant, because his statements were in precise mathematical terms.\n\n&gt;Consistency means my premises are guaranteed to entail my conclusion. The math forces me to lay my assumptions bare and derive testable conclusions from them. There’s no ambiguity over what I’m assuming. All (publishable) mathematical models are logically consistent.\n\n&gt;So economists aren’t using math just for the sake of appearances.\n\nI'd suggest giving the whole thing a read.  It explains clearly why economists use the models they do, even when those models might not be 100% realistic:\n\n&gt;Simplifying assumptions are necessary for any theoretical model in any science. Economists often start with a baseline model that’s as simple as possible, and add frictions as necessary by relaxing restrictive critical assumptions. A critical assumption is one which, when relaxed (made more \"realistic\"), changes the conclusion we wish to test in a given context.\n\n&gt;Consider minimum wages in the labor market. Assuming a perfectly competitive market, a price floor like the MW is predicted to lower employment. The perfect competition assumption includes the \"sub-assumption\" that employers have no market power to affect the wage. Relax this assumption (i.e., give employers more bargaining power and call it \"imperfect competition\"), and it’s now possible for a moderate MW to actually increase employment. The testable conclusion of the supply and demand model of the labor market has changed once we assume imperfect competition instead of perfect competition. The assumption of no employer market power is thus a critical one when we want to analyze the effects of minimum wages on employment.\n\n&gt;Now consider taxes on cigarettes. It doesn’t matter if we assume perfect or imperfect competition in the cigarette market; a tax on cigarettes is unambiguously predicted to raise price. In this case, perfect competition is not a critical assumption, as relaxing it wouldn’t alter the conclusion we want to test in this scenario.\n\n&gt;This reasoning applies in natural sciences, as well. Quote:\n\n&gt;&gt;If the goal is to put a satellite into orbit, the equations that define Newton's laws of motion and gravity, though not 100% correct, are more than sufficient; you don't need Einstein's theories of relativity though they would provide a more accurate description. But if the goal is to determine a GPS device's location on earth you do need relativity. [...] So there is this art in modeling, this choosing of some aspects and ignoring others, trying to create the the right approximations. **As [famous statistician George Box] notes: \"there is no need to ask the question 'Is the model true?'. If 'truth' is to be the 'whole truth' the answer must be 'No'. The only question of interest is 'Is the model illuminating and useful?'\"**"}

Or is it unlikely and they will just continue selling the TV at $700?","answer":"Inflation is the rate of increase in the aggregate price level. If the yearly inflation rate is x%, it means that consumer prices are on average x% higher than a year ago. In other words, if a consumer price index had the value 100 last year, with 10% inflation it would be 110 this year. If inflation rate dropped to 3%, it would become 110*(1+3%)=113.3 next year.

{"question":"In general, what proportion of the return from real estate is rent and what proportion is property value appreciation? I've been told you definitely can't beat the market without both. Is it about half and half in most cases?","answer":"There are four benefits to owning rental real estate: cash flow, appreciation, amortization and tax benefits.\n\nCash flow is the monthly income you're generating, which, these days, is likely to be somewhere between 4% and 10% of your investment per year.\n\nAppreciation is two things... Forced appreciation is the value you add through renovations, over and above the cost of the renovations. Natural appreciation is property values increasing over time due to inflation and market forces.\n\nPersonally, I don't like to factor in natural appreciation to my returns, as historically, natural appreciation in many areas has tracked inflation. But the other thing that tracks inflation is expenses, so you don't get the full benefit of natural appreciation because it's offset by inflation in expenses.  If you get lucky, you may make a lot of money through value inflation, but that has been a more recent phenomena and there's no way to know if that trend will continue or not.\n\nThat said, forced appreciation is probably one of the fastest ways to build equity, and while it takes some effort, is the reason that I prefer to buy properties that are distressed and have room for value add through renovation.\n\nAmortization is just a fancy word for paying down the principal every month through your regular mortgage payments. These days, this is probably the best way to make money from your properties. With interest rates so low, and loan terms so good, I'm seeing between 5% and 15% equity build up per year on my investment through principal pay down.  Even if you ignore the other benefits of owning real estate, the amortization itself beats the stock market for me.\n\nThe other benefit of amortization and loans, in general, is that we are likely to see inflation over the next several years or decades. This means that you will be paying back your loans in inflated dollars, thus creating an arbitrage opportunity that costs you absolutely nothing.\n\nThe tax benefits are the final upside of owning rental real estate.  Depreciation allows you to get a tax benefit in each year that you hold the property, oftentimes outweighing much or all of the income you generate, meaning that the government is essentially allowing you to use your rental income as a tax-free loan for as long as you hold the property.\n\nWhich of those benefits will be the greatest for you is going to depend on a lot of things, including where you buy, the types of houses you buy, the price point, the amount of renovation needed, your personal tax situation, your ability to get good loans, and how much work you're willing to put into sourcing properties. But, between those four benefits, it's not difficult to achieve 20% or more returns these days with real estate, especially if you're willing to be a little bit hands-on."}

In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze.

{"question":"I’m in my early 20s and feeling a bit lost at the moment. I currently earn 87k and have begun saving to be able to purchase my first home. All is going perfectly but I’m still not satisfied because I can’t figure out the reason for doing all of this. \n\nJust the thought of going to work, coming home to a family, going on holidays once a year and repeating for 40 years sounds incredibly depressing.

When your time is near, will you look back and be proud of what you have spent your valuable time on?","answer":"I went through this. I didn't want the career, the wife and kids, and white picket fence.

{"question":"It seems that recessions come like clockwork but what about economic depressions like the great depression? What is the likelihood of one occuring in the next 60 years or so and what (if there are any) signs are there that one is approaching?","answer":"Pretty low. The fact is, a depression stems from a recession that lasts. \nFor a depression to happen, it basically entails that either the fiscal side or the monetary or both of those side aren't doing what is necessary to fight the recession which leads to a spiral.\n\nA recession becomes a depression when businesses go under, unemployment rise, households are reluctant to spending which leads to even more businesses going under and it then impact the financial system as people and companies aren't able to repay their loans.\n\nFiscal and monetary can fight that, the fiscal side can compensate for the lack of demand during the recession and support distressed companies, avoiding a widespread wave of bankruptcies. \n\nMonetary stimulus can help by acting as a lender of last resort providing liquidity to whoever needs it, households don't need to be scared about a bank going under and doing a run on it (bank runs are a pure disaster for an economy). They can also reduce the interest rates making loan to distressed companies more affordable.\n\nIf you look at what happened during the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve messed up. Instead of increasing the money supply, it actually steadily decreased during the whole duration of the Great Depression.\n\nIn large part because of bank runs : depositors lost money (which meant lower spending from them) but it also meant less lending to an already distressed economy. If the Federal Reserve had acted appropriately by providing liquidity to the banks who needed it, the depression probably wouldn't never have happened. Depositors would have never lost money which means more spending and less bankruptcies, and banks could have kept lending flowing to companies.\n\nThis why economists typically say that it's better to provide too much than not providing enough. Overshoot, great you can scale back. Undershoot ? It's going to be painful, by the time you act the damage is already done."}

{"question":"In terms of tax-funded benefits they receive and tax money they pay and other economic effects, how does immigration both legal and illegal look overall through pure cost\/benefit analyses?","answer":"Short answer: No.\n\nLong Answer: Undocumented Immigrants *contribute* more than they take in terms of nearly everything pertaining to how and where they work. \n\nUndocumented Immigrants contribute [$12B](https:\/\/itep.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/ITEP-2017-Undocumented-Immigrants-State-and-Local-Contributions.pdf) in taxes. That they can actually pay. This figure would go up if they were given a pathway to citizenship. \n\nFirst generation undocumented immigrants work jobs most Americans won't.

{"question":"Comparative advantage in today's global economy is basically one countries wages are lower so stuff is built there and sold to countries with high waged worker what will happen when everyone is making a wage such that comparative advantage is lost will protectionist policies be put on to propel domestic industries like post great depression?","answer":"I think you're misunderstanding comparative advantage.\n\nComparative advantage is like this: Consider two countries that both make wine and cloth. Country A can make *both* wine and cloth more efficiently and more profitably than Country B. But Country A makes wine *much* better than Country B does while making cloth only a little better. So wine is just way more profitable for Country A than cloth is. In that case, Country A is better off buying cloth from Country B even though it's more expensive than making cloth themselves because overall, it's better to focus production on making and selling wine.\n\nFor Country A, switching production from wine to cloth would cost more than the cost difference between producing cloth and buying cloth. So even though Country B doesn't have any products that it makes better than Country A, it has a *comparative advantage* in producing cloth because it has a lower opportunity cost for not producing wine."}
{"question":"I may be wrong about this, but why does it seem like there is a conflict of interest between what's best for individual finance vs the economy? For example, it's best for a person to live frugally and use the most money to invest (education, health, retirement, etc.); whereas, it's better for the economy if everybody spends all of their money on not just essential but also luxurious goods. A society where people save more than they spend is a deflationary one. Likewise, a society where people invest more than they spend would probably cause a market bubble since more people buying a company's stock than it's product just drives its PE ratio through the roof\n\nAnother example is having kids is expensive. It's best for a poor couple to not have kids or only one if they want to get out of poverty as fast as possible. However, in economics, every couple should have 2 kids to sustain the future workforce and consumer spending.","answer":"I like the other comments here, and for once, I'll try to keep my addition focussed to the examples and mention another example, instead of going into the more broad ideas. In general, I’d note that, because most of these also either result in more consumption now or later, it is generally a matter of time preferences. Instead, your point will generally only hold if wealth-moving services\/goods conflict with more productive services\/goods.\n\n\nDebunks:\n\n\n* Not spending can be bad for future consumption, but people tend to forget that saving  results in investment (if you deposit money, it is usually borrowed by someone else). In the [Solow]( https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model) there is a golden-rule Savings rate, and while we do not empirically know the rate, the last time I had courses in traditional growth theory we were usually assumed to save too little. Now, short-run spending can bridge the output gap and thus can cause growth – my point is just that it is not as black and white as people think. The most important point is that it would still be up to personal preference (discount rate) what you would prefer – long-term higher growth or current-term more consumption. So even if it negatively affects growth, we can’t say that that causes suboptimal utility. \n\n\n* In the case of investing ‘too much’ (resulting in high PE ratios, causing a ‘bubble’) – this is similarly only problematic if we see a shift afterwards. If the P\/E ratios go up for all companies alike, this simply suggests that we are valuing future profit (and thus future income) much more than current (you can see how this is linked to the other point). Only if we assume that later on, suddenly people will stop caring about this, this is a bubble.\n\n\n* Your example for kids is only relevant if you consider the economy as a whole – if you would think of GDP per capita, it may not be bad at all.\n\n\nExample where it holds:\n\n\n* There is evidence ([1]( https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/jofi.12385?casa_token=l7WtgKLRQv4AAAAA%3A_dsD8jgq5BC4iyUL9DCe7-idZYiMUqwkO6K3rU5a29idht5WxqqBu81vk0bI6fdPseYFJuaRXDmAn_LG), [2]( https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/mac.2.3.158)) which suggests that a significantly large financial system harms economic growth by competing with other sectors (e.g. tech) for talent. The reasoning is simple; imagine that a person, when working for Google, could create a product which would make Google 100$M in profit, and create 100$M consumer surplus. That person could, similarly, start working for a financial institution, at which he\/she causes 200$M in profit. This could however come from a (near) zero-sum game, at which point we are (largely) moving wealth, not creating it. Still, as the additional profit is higher, the firm could very well compete for this talent."}

{"question":"For instance. \n\nA private company takes over the management of an electrical grid. To increase profits, they reduce maintenance, which makes privatization look like a good choice\/efficient. But after a decade, the lack of maintenance catches up with them and service disruptions occur. They then say they need to increase fees. But if they'd not extracted that profit there would have been money for maintenance in the first place. \n\nNow, that's not to say that publicly managed utilities aren't mismanaged, etc. But is the criticism fair? After all, the public utility is using all the pie, while the private one is using only what isn't taken for profit.","answer":"Privatisations almost always come with heavy performance commitments. In practice, this means rather than decreasing maintenance, they often have to commit to increasing maintenance or otherwise investing in infrastructure. \n\nIn general, long dated assets like infrastructure are funded by cash flows very far in the future. Private companies often have the ability to withstand upfront losses for the promise of future cash flow; but governments are actually really bad at that. This is primarily because government budgets for infrastructure tend to be political decisions for the Budget, which means they are decided by the exigencies of that particular year.\n\nMechanisms also exist to prevent infrastructure companies from profiting too much during privatisations. These are generally called Regulated Asset Base models. In general, they sort of guarantee x% return to the company, but also fixes the pricing they're allowed to charge as a percentage of the investments they put in.\n\nEdit since it's a hot topic in the comments:\n\nYes - in practice enforcement is not always easy, and in many cases the multiple mechanisms are not applied at the same time or in sufficient size. In countries with endemic corruption, the entire infrastructure platform is effectively given away for free to politically connected people, the post-Soviet world being a very prime example. While in countries like the US where lobbying is fervent and restricting profits is politically taboo, the terms are either not well enforced or just weak.\n\nIn some cases, the enforcement is overzealous or otherwise prohibitive. UK energy pricing rules required strict price limits and limited profitability, this forced energy providers to cut costs aggressively particularly by reducing their electricity price hedges. When energy prices spiked, those companies were unprotected and also unable to raise prices, eventually bankrupting half of them and requiring various government interventions. In Germany, so much emphasis is placed on ensuring that small rural communities have internet access even at ridiculous costs that everywhere else is underinvested and Germany of all countries has the worst telecom infrastructure in Europe.\n\nExecuting any economic policy, especially one as comprehensive and complex as a nationalisation \/ privatisation is never going to be simple or perfect. Economics provides us with tools, theories, and mechanisms, but humans and institutions ultimately have to execute."}

{"question":"I am not very educated in economics and I love to be proven wrong. Throughout my life I always identified with the economics of the left.

For example, macroeconomists have developed models to help central banks make monetary decisions that help the economy grow. They have also developed models on the optimal way to tax capital and redistribute wealth. \n\nIn my experience, anyone who self-identifies as a right-wing economist or a left-wing economist is more of a sociologist or political scientist (and usually not a very good one).\n\nSome famous economists with left-wing ideas include: Thomas Piketty and Nobel Laureates Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz.

{"question":"From what I understand, working conditions such as work-life balance will be better for labor in a labor market where the supply of labor is low compared to the demand for labor. Meaning they are in-demand. Therefore you see better work conditions for engineers and IT people who have a higher skillset. \n\nDoctors and nurses clearly have a very high skillset.

{"question":"I keep seeing suggestions that there should be a cap on this things. Usually when people suggest this, they don't really care or think about the economical implications, say for example price caps. \n\nWhat exactly would be the implications for this? And would it be necessary negative?","answer":"TLDR;\n\n* overall, hard to say as it depends a lot on what the specifics are, but I would bet that hard caps on relatively low levels of ownership are net negatives.\n* effects of corporate onwership on housing markets aren't super well understood and I don't feel confident making exact predictions. In general the limited research seems to say corporate owners tend to be \"worse\" landlords, [possibly have positive impacts neighborhoods, and have some positive upward pressure on prices](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3410281) (either through monopoly power, [the ability to buy distressed assets in bulk, or the ability to provide floors for prices during downturns](https:\/\/www.philadelphiafed.org\/-\/media\/frbp\/assets\/working-papers\/2019\/wp19-45.pdf)).\n* what effects there are will vary a lot by geography\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn full, it's again hard to say without specifics about the proposal. I'm assuming that when you mean \"cap on number of properties\" you're including both single-family homes, apartments, and condos in your proposal. I'm also going to intentionally say \"cap on number of properties\" and \"large tax on ownership that increases with number of properties\" are similar enough to be treated the same.\n\nAnyways, first, whenever you hear \"X percent of homes last year\/month\/whatever were bought by corporate landlords\" what that means is that in the last time period, X percent of the names on the deeds contained words like \"LLC\", \"LLP\", \"Corporate\", etc. That'll capture the Blackstone\/Imagine Homes\/Zillow\/ other big \"institutional\" investors, but it'll also grab any landlord who happens to have incorporated as an LLC. Sometimes that's what people care about, but often they only want the former and not the latter. It's also not clear how universities or non-profits -- which are often some of the largest landowners in a city -- are treated given they'll often have words like \"Corporation\" or \"Trust\" in their name which will get flagged.\n\nThose are all fixable, but there are administrative problems with identifying corporations, which get harder when you try to tie your proposal to the specific number of homes each corporation owns especially since large landlords like Blackstone have huge networks of opaque subsidiaries.\n\nBut let's assume you can do a decent job of identifying corporations, and that you somehow can get through whatever layer of shell companies exist so that you somehow know how many properties each one has. It's still not really clear what an optimal cap looks like, if there is one.\n\nFirst, the negatives against institutional ownership. There's some evidence [that real estate investors drove up prices following the foreclosure crisis in 2008](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/1540-6229.12396), but this is a little more nuanced than just investors driving up prices; investors also help stabalize markets by setting something of a floor for property values. It's also a little tough to evaluate the effect of large institutional investors purchasing things since they usually purchase pretty distressed assets in bulk quantities, but it's not clear what would have happened to those asset holders had they not been able to sell. There's also s[ome evidence that institutional investors drive up rent prices](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3410281), but it's a little ambiguous whether this increase is from monopoly power vs changes in ammenities (in particular less crime). Lastly, there's literature on whether big landlords tend to be more exploitative towards tenants and it [Seems like they're worse for tenants](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2893552).\n\nIt's kinda unclear though, at what geographic and ownership concentration level these negative effects exist and if they do exist, how big a deal they are -- [the literature on foreign ownership](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixoMyEntT7AhWaRDABHWxoAH0QFnoECBwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aeaweb.org%2Fconference%2F2021%2Fpreliminary%2Fpaper%2FsEFGk7nH&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FGq2iulR8OLw0YWY9r85V) (see pages 6-8), which is kind of analogous, is all over the place: in some places it matters, it other places it doesn't, and it isn't clear to me how to tell you which bucket your city falls in. All this matters for picking a policy, and I don't think there's a clearcut answer to what optimal thresholds might exist and what kinds of markets we should be focusing on.\n\nSo what's the problem with picking a cap or a tax that's too high? Besides the normal arguments against deadweight loss, that if there's no harm investors should be able to invest, that this is a waste of time and resources etc. the first big one would be that you might kill off investment during a time when most places are already facing housing shortages. This depends on how aggressive your cap\/tax on. If it's really aggressive I could see it killing off the \"mega development\" projects that develop thousands of units since those might automatically make a landlord qualify. This could have obvious affordability and local development impacts.\n\nThe second big one would be that you would need someone to be able to step in during a downturn -- again, when people talk about places [like Detroit where investors bought large amounts of foreclosed homes](https:\/\/www.bridgemi.com\/urban-affairs\/university-michigan-invested-big-detroit-now-come-evictions), it's not clear to me whether that's a better or worse outcome than what would have happened had you banned them from buying. The usual solution I've seen involves the government stepping in, or offering dilapidated homes to people willing to live in them, but local governments -- in particular Detroit -- often have very limited money and people often don't want to live in dilapidated homes in recession hit cities. So it's not clear to me that the disease is better than the cure.\n\nAs a last note, I think in general most places don't have high levels of institutional investment (in the same way that most places don't have lots of AirBnBs or lots of foreign ownership), and so thinking that this will be the silver bullet for high rent prices (as opposed to more supply) is incorrect and potentially a red herring. Most focus should probably be on some combo of increased supply + money for low-income tenants."}

Is this a good moment to buy? Or should I switch to a different ETF focused on clean energy?","answer":"Clean energy is a volatile business that's sensitive to all kinds of unsystematic (idiosyncratic) risk:\n\n* Government policies on things like tax credits, carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, subsidies, etc.\n* Supply and demand\n* Materials supply chain\n* Competition with prices of non-renewables\n* Irrational optimism about the future importance of the sector\n* Weather (!)\n\nWe can speculate about a few reasons for why clean energy stock prices are falling. One is that clean energy companies have not grown as much as expected. Expectations about future growth were priced in; as these companies don't meet analysts' earnings targets, investors pull out, leading to lower share prices that reflect the new expectations.\n\nAnother potential problem is that many of these companies are capital-intensive, with large amounts of debt and a reliance on government contracts and subsidies. A renewable energy plant (e.g. waste processing) may take billions of dollars and several years to construct. As interest rates rise, they have a harder time raising new debt. In the US, 10-year rates are up about 60% since January.\n\nYou would think that governments' increased focus on clean energy would result in higher share prices for clean energy companies. Lots more demand, right? But that isn't necessarily the case. Higher demand can result in more competition, with more companies competing for the same marketshare, resulting in lower profits overall, and ultimately a saturated market. Just because clean energy is \"hot\" doesn't mean everyone gets rich. Google and Facebook saw huge growth because they can expand to ridiculous scales with relatively low capital investment and minimal customer aquisition costs. Energy companies don't work the same way.\n\nThe market can be super hot and yet everyone is trying to capture the same contracts. Of course, not everything is about infrastructure; companies like SunRun and Enphase make electronics that goes into solar installations, a market with different dynamics altogether. It's interesting that US and Chinese solar companies (SunRun, Enphase, SolarEdge, First Solar, etc.) have done much worse recently than European wind power companies (Vestas, Orsted, etc.), for example.\n\nI'm probably missing a bunch of things here (and I'm not an expert by far!), but those are some starting points.\n\nIt's worth noting that the energy sector as a whole is way up over 2020, and has been one of the best-performing sectors. VDE is up 41.85% YTD, compared to 11.58% for the S&amp;P 500. Unfortunately, much of the gains are from oil and natural gas. Exxon, Chevron, etc. are way up."}

Ie- buying a gilt today releases ~£100 into the economy today but it has a positive yield so it takes those profits out of tomorrow’s economy; the original owner could have been spending the coupon payments whereas the bank will not. \n\nThe central banks are buyers and sellers of last resort, and here they are the buyers of last resort to keep lending cheap. \n\nThe printing money, here, is due to the collaboration with the treasury. BOE print money to buy gilts, the government issue new gilts, and the new money goes directly on furlough. This has some inflationary pressure, but not enough to counter the pandemic. This increases savings\/reduces debt of the people in the short term. \n\nLonger term, if we return to a sense of normal quickly, the additional savings will be spent pretty quickly and lead to inflation at that point. Possibly. \n\n\nIf the BOE really wanted to print money, they’d be utilising the governments overdraft facility more - this allows new money into the economy with no real reduction in the future money supply. This is still not in use as far as I’m aware."}

{"question":"From supply demand standpoint, increasing overall global population and mobility increases supply of people, and automation and machinery replacing human labour decreases the demand for people. \n\nUltimately that reduces the value\/price of a person to establish a new equilibrium. Does this explain why wages stagnate?","answer":"No, this is just the [lump of labor fallacy](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/l\/lump-of-labour-fallacy.asp). Basically, people add to the supply of labor but they also add to the demand because people don't just work, they also buy stuff. So there's no particular reason to think that an increase in population leads to a decline in living standards, especially if that population growth happens smoothly over time, which it tends to do.\n\nEdit: For automation, see our [FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_automation)"}
{"question":"I started trading at the end of the bull run Jan-Fab, had a great run as beginner,   \nI had a initial investment of 37k took that up to 52k roughly, when we had that pullback in late Feb things started go sideways with me, took a major loss then my emotions got the best of me, I traded with oversize \"weak risk management I'd say\" very weak. I went heavy in trades and most of them ended up with a big L, tried to make up for my previous losses one after another till my account is now at 2.6k CRAZY. I can't express how I really feel it's beyond me, now I spend all my day thinking about wtf I did, depressed and feel heavy pressure that I don't know how to get back up, zero confidence. I took this fuck up to the next level of failures. This is really gotten to me mentally and I'm 22yo I feel beaten down and hiding my pain from everyone. I just want your advice how to get through this mentally. Please don't rub it in I'm already down bad. :(","answer":"I'm 25 and am literally in the exact same situation you're in right now. Nothing really compares to losing a relatively incomprehensible amount of money in such a short time. Many people say it's \"just money\", but for me, and probably for you as well, it's much more when you think of the bills and debt that could have been paid with it.\n\nLearn. You absolutely have to learn, teach yourself relentlessly. I'm tell you, the only way you'll make it back is if you learn how to trade and\/or invest. I'm not there yet and haven't made much back but I'm on my way. I've spent the past 2 months dumping ALL of my time into learning technical and fundamental analysis, and I'll be honest, I don't have confidence in my trading yet but the knowledge has given me hope. The hope is the only thing keeping me going. That, and a lot of support from my friends and family. I only tell them what I want them to know (they DON'T know how much I blew lol), but generalize mostly that I'm struggling and it's hard, but that I have a plan. I know it'll take a while to really get good, but after what I've learned, I can see myself being profitable in the future.\n\nYou need risk management above all else. Preservation of capital is the only thing that will save you, you're in this game to survive above all else. This includes both stop orders and exposure limitations, as well as diversification of what you're trading. The money will come, but you have to set realistic expectations and understand it may take a few years. Trade small and don't allow yourself to blow up again. \n\nYou need a strategy to tell you what setups to trade. You should use fundamental analysis to establish a bias (long or short). You need technical analysis to understand when to enter and exit a trade. Having a mentor helps, I haven't had much of that aspect yet but I've heard it's essential.\n\nChoosing the right market is also important. I wanted to trade stocks, but having a cash account makes it hard with settlement periods. Having a margin account is great but I can't afford to tie up 25k due to PDT, and to potentially lose it all again if I fuck up. I'm looking into forex right now, because you can still trade price action with any acount size and integrate a little news into your strategies.\n\nDM me if you want a little extra help. I'm struggling myself but I really truly believe it's possible to make that money back and eventually turn this into a career of financial independence based on the idea of being consistently profitable. I found out that for every person who YOLO'd their second mortgage on GME calls, there's a thousand people with loss porn they're too embarrassed to share."}
{"question":"Doing this just seems to make sense: you help fill the gap that the drop in consumer spending has created and you produce something useful that would likely improve efficiency and the productive capacity of the economy. This seems especially suited to the US due to some of the country’s antiquated infrastructure. \n\n\nThis is why I can’t work out why the US wouldn’t try and stimulate the economy in this way.

Building a new bridge is a bigger deal than adding a new lane to an existing bridge.\n\nIn the US the lead times due to environmental, legal, and labor regulations are so long that it is hard to be counter cyclical. By the time the paperwork is done and all the lawsuits finished the economic situation has changed and stimulus may not be needed.\n\nThe type of people that need help the most are unlikely to be the skilled workers that do infrastructure. So instead of helping poor people who are out of a job because of the pandemic you end up bidding the price of skilled labor higher and substituting public projects for private projects,"}

But does that mean that tourism is the real driver of the unaffordability problem?\n\nIf so, why does Airbnb get the blame, and not other tourist infrastructure like hotels? Just like Airbnb, if land in a city centre is purchased to build a hotel on, it would increase demand for land and therefore increase prices.","answer":"Hospitality economics student here, we've had this exact discussion with one of our professors:\n\nEssentially, it boils down to the fact that airb'n'b rents out what is meant to be Appartements. People have lower costs of business, which lowers the price, which shifts both the demand and the 'break even' point. Rooms can more easily be allowed to stay empty for a night or two.\n\nAdditionally, lessors are able to charge more because, if you have an Appartement that would be worth 1000 $ and you can rent it out as an airb'n'b for 10 out of 30 nights, you can increase the rent while still being able to find a lessee."}

{"question":"I recently became a millionaire this past month at the age of 29, but realized that my life has not materially changed in any way. I still have to continue going to my day job as I can't afford to live off my investments in my HCOL area. I've done some calculations and my fatFIRE number is 7-8M. I would be able to live very comfortably on that number and could splurge  here and there but I would still need to budget. With inflation, that number could be 10M when I turn 40 in a decade. This is also assuming that I stay single and\/or have no kids in the future.\n\nGrowing up, being a millionaire was always viewed as extraordinary accomplishment and it still is, but today a million dollars doesn't take you very far. The term millionaire was created in the 1700s or 1800s. Adjusted for inflation, a million dollars in 1900 would be worth around 30M today.

{"question":"Curious as to what all the trolls think ethereum is worth longterm. Please provide some insight as to why you're bullish or why your bearish.\nTROLL AWAY","answer":"I'm bearish on eth as a whole. Leaky ICOs where they will never be worth more than the day they were funded, the currency is inflationary compared to bitcoin as a store of value, the tech is interesting and has potential but not truly investable unless privately for true equity. For these reasons, I don't see it following bitcoin metrics nor reaching bitcoin prices whatsoever. ICOs will market manipulate and no large scale investor would be willing to take that risk.\n\nHowever, I am bullish on the price as a stock, it is entirely from my own perspective of what i think eth is worth. at ~$150, it is worth purchasing. Since it has tested the $300 mark, I believe that the market would be willing to invest at these current prices. I don't see it falling under $100. \n\nThe market movement entirely depends on a hedge-fund purchase or large buyer to cause it to spike and the followers will trail, like a stock. If it's just laymen and ICOs, it will never really flourish because ICOs will push the market down inevitably, and with a huge pipeline of ICOs lined up, you can bet on it. \n\nJust cause it may spike in the next few days\/weeks, does not mean it's investable, it means it has reach a pricepoint that an investor would be willing to take a risk to make some profit. It does mean that it will be inevitably cashed out and converted to fiat. \n\nThis is all just my analysis and opinion."}

How would that process work?\n\nI thank you in advance and am not looking for political answers but distinctly economic ones.","answer":"You're trying to tease out the difference between income and assets.\n\nIncome is how much money Jeff Bezos puts into his checking account every year. This is \"cash money\" that Jeff can use to buy milk, air planes, rare paintings, rocket ships, or whatever else he wants. Jeff reports this income to the IRS and pays taxes like everyone else.\n\nAssets are the total value of everything Jeff owns and could sell to generate income. For Jeff, his assets are primarily Amazon stock. The sum total of Jeff's assets (minus his debts) is the ~$100B valuation that you commonly see for his net worth.\n\nThe majority of Jeff's income comes from stock that he sells. The IRS then collects taxes on the capital gains from those stock sales. For Jeff, this saves a ton of money in taxes, because his long term capital gains tax rate is 20% compared to his income tax rate of 37% (assuming Jeff has income of &gt; ~$500k per year which we all know is a pretty safe assumption).\n\nWhen politicians talk about taxing billionaires, they're often talking about increasing taxes on capital gains to try and tax more of that income that is disproportionately held by billionaires compared to the average taxpayer.

{"question":"The market taking a tumble makes me want to go all in on dividends because my div portfolio is pretty much all in the green lol.\n\nI’m young so I want to be in growth stocks too, but I’m wondering if you guys have a split for investing in growth and dividend stocks?\n\nIm thinking 60% growth \/ 40% dividend","answer":"I think you are looking at this the wrong way.\n\nWhen stock prices go down, I personally get excited.

You want companies that grow over time, as well as grow their dividend over time. Apple is an excellent dividend growth company. So is visa, Costco, home depot, broadcom, etc."}

The poster took an absolute beating by the other members.  The community there was more typically a hard core cost-savings leanishFIRE community (although nobody called it that back then).\n\nThen about a year later the OP died and one astute poster realized that the old argument about the harpsichord where everyone had piled onto him was the same guy whose untimely death they were all mourning.\n\nThe post and thread [can be seen here](https:\/\/boards.fool.com\/lbym-pariahs-revisited-the-harpsichord-15015155.aspx) and I often think back about it and the guy.

{"question":"So I have heard that at least 20% of the existing money supply was printed  from 2020 to now, which leads me to ask, did President Biden drive inflation by signing coronavirus relief\/stimulus packages into law? to what extent is the Federal Reserve to blame for inflation (due to the maintenance of low rates to artificially keep the economy going).","answer":"Inflation in the short run changes according to the total amount of demand in the economy (aggregate demand) vs the economy's productive capacity (aggregate supply). Inflation will tend to accelerate if the economy is overheating (aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply), and will tend to decelerate if the economy is in a recession (aggregate demand is less than aggregate supply).\n\nThere have been two factors driving inflation. i) Aggregate Supply has been reduced by the various COVID related production and supply chain issues - not President Biden's fault. ii) Aggregate Demand has increased in the last year, partly by the reopening of the economy and partly by the various coronavirus relief and stimulus packages. If Biden had not supported or had vetoed the various coronavirus relief and stimulus packages last year, inflation would be lower this year. On the other hand, people would have suffered more, unemployment would be higher, and the economy would not be booming today. \n\nThe Federal Reserve has contributed to the inflationary environment by being dovish and signaling that interest rate will not rise for some time. On the other hand, inflation had been below target for some years and they were strongly motivated to raise it. They may have been overly dovish in retrospect, but central banking is not an easy task, since we can only know the past and not the future. It can be compared with trying to drive a car while only looking in the rearview mirror."}

{"question":"I would assume that the stock market is just going to plummet worse than it already has.   Pretty much every report I've seen says it will too.  But are they necessarily tied together?","answer":"It’s not a dumb question - it’s a basic one that most people assume they know the answer to but don’t.\n\nTo start, what is the “stock market?” Simply put it’s a “The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where regular activities of buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place” (https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/stockmarket.asp).\n\nThe stock market is where investors can buy equity from other companies in hopes of selling that equity at a higher price and making money or receiving dividends (please see edit below for clarification). \n\nNow what is an economy? \n\n“An economy is the large set of inter-related production and consumption activities that aid in determining how scarce resources are allocated” (https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/economy.asp).\n\nBasically an “economy” is just word that describes how people spend their money.\n\nWhat’s the relationship?\n\nThe relationship is direct (at times). If the economy is doing well then the market is doing well. Likewise vice versa. \n\nHere’s an example of where that wasn’t the case.\n\n(https:\/\/www.economicshelp.org\/blog\/541\/economics\/relationship-between-stock-market-and-economy\/)\n\n“In October 1987, stock markets around the world fell 25%. Many feared this predicted a major global recession. In response policymakers cut interest rates. But, the stock market crash appeared to have no bearing on the economy. The late 1980s were a boom time in many western economies. Even now, investors are not entirely sure why share prices fell 25%. Some blame ‘technical factors.’”\n\nWhy is this the case? Well the economy really isn’t composed of expectations - the stock market is.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, an economy can chug along regardless of what anyone thinks of it. Financial markets are really dependent on parties agreeing on the prices of the equity and debt that is being traded.\n\nThat’s a really simple overview of a pretty complicated topic. Thanks for asking and thanks to the guys replying to me pointing out my mistakes. \n\nEDIT: for clarification: when I used the term “stock market” I was using it in the vernacular of “all financial markets” which is what most people think when they talk about the stock market. Technically there are a couple financial markets (stock market, bond market, so on and so forth).\n\nI tried to make things simple but I don’t want to feed you misinformation. Here is an article on the subject (https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/09\/difference-between-bond-stock-market.asp).\n\nAlso, I was too lax when describing the economy: please refer to the reply below for a better description of what economy is.\n\nEDIT: I added some more information at the end.

{"question":"Maybe it’s a better question for r\/nostupidquestions, but this feels like a fitting sub. If a company makes its shareholders Xthousand dollars this year, why do they need to make 10% more the next year? This growth, in many well established companies\/industries is not organic and is predatory, unsustainable, and often downright cruel. So why is it such a standard outlook on business operation?","answer":"&gt;If a company makes its shareholders Xthousand dollars this year, why do they need to make 10% more the next year?\n\nWell, it depends.\n\nYou don't necessarily *need* to grow. Especially in well established industries, you could chose to be perfectly fine with your spot in the market and don't aim for (much) growth.\n\nOn the other hand, in some industries, this might be necessary. If your industry moves so fast that if you don't innovate and stay competitive you fall behind and lose more and more market share. Nobody would buy a smartphone from a company that hasn't changed since 2010.\n\nThat said, companies actually owned by shareholders usually have an obligation to make a profit (at least eventually), because from a shareholder perspective, that's the point and that's how you profit from owning a company. \n\n&gt;This growth, in many well established companies\/industries is not organic and is predatory, unsustainable, and often downright cruel.\n\nWhat do you base that on? Companies have grown at a decent pace just fine and there have always been high and low growth industries. Sure, some companies are \"bad\" or unsustainable, but to suggest that's a significant portion doesn't really make much sense."}

We could stop taxing and just allow the debt to increase faster.","answer":"&gt; I see lots of people arguing that the federal debt isn't important so long as it's issued in fiat currency.\n\nThey're wrong. Higher debt means higher interest payments, which means less money available for general government spending (as well as the need to collect money for interest payments via taxes).\n\nWhat people usually mean by this is \"debt isn't a big deal because, in a bind, the government could just print money to pay off the debt.\" This ignores two factors: 1) the U.S. government (as well as most governments around the world) does not currently have the legal ability to print money (only the Federal Reserve, or central banks, can print money) and more importantly 2) printing money to pay off the debt (as opposed to taxes) would cause inflation."}

It never seems to turn out well.  There are lots of shadow-banned comments here.  You're not missing very much by not seeing them.  I rather like the one suggesting an 8-day working week though, I might approve that one.\n\nWe see all-sorts of headlines about this.  The Foo corporation experiments with a 4 days workweek and it's a great success.  Or, occasionally, the Bar company experiments with a 4 day workweek and goes back to a 5 day workweek.  None of this is very enlightening.\n\nEach job is different.  Jobs requires different amounts of physical and mental energy.  They also attract different types of people who value different things.  That's why there are different patterns of working.  Many people work part-time now.  Many workers in production work shifts.  Similarly, those who work in operations that have to be on-call also work shifts - e.g. fireman and doctors.\n\nBusinesses and organizations choose what they believe is the right structure for each part operations.  Businesses are optimizing for points 3, 4 &amp; 5 on the OP's list.  On the other side, workers choose which businesses offer the conditions they prefer.  It's like pay, and perks, it's something that a person evaluates when considering a job.  They are optimizing for 1 &amp; 2 on the OP's list.\n\nThere is no good justification for the state changing private employment contracts through legislations.\n\nLastly, we have to remember that ultimately the individual is in control.  In a free society neither the state nor the businesses can really change much.  People can always retire and they can spend time unemployed.  People can always work at their own projects in their own time.  If the working week is too long for most people's preferences then they will take breaks between jobs or retire early.  If the working week is too short for people's preferences then they'll work part-time in other jobs, or in household production."}
{"question":"\n\nThe pharmacist job market just makes no sense to me. In the US, median pay is $128,000, whereas in other countries it is MUCH lower. The UK for example has a median pharmacist salary less than $50,000. Why don't pharmacists from other countries come to the US and take jobs here? There's a huge gap in pay between US pharmacists and most other countries, it seems ripe for arbitrage.","answer":"Pharmacists make more in the US because the educational requirements are much, much higher.  In the US you typically get a science BS degree with lots of prerequisites (4 years of college) and then another 4 years of graduate school to get the \"Pharm D\" degree.\n\nIn the UK, it is just a 4-year degree that they call an MPharm degree.  Half the education, you get half the pay?\n\nAdditionally, my guess is that in the UK the typical pharmacist works solo (but I could be very wrong about that).

{"question":"I apologize in advance for how morbid this post is. I am in no way supporting this, I'm merely curious. \n\nLet's hypothetically say that when covid-19 first started, the U.S. decided to do nothing and simply let the disease run it's course and kill anyone that was vulnerable. In March, the Imperial College of London estimated that without intervention, as many as 2.2 million Americans would die. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety places the value of a human life at around $10 million dollars. By this calculation the 2 million excess deaths would cost the economy $20 trillion. \n\nHowever, most of the deaths would be senior citizens who are at the end of their working life and have no more earning potential. Their remaining assets would likely be transferred to their families after death. Covid-19 has already cost the US $16 trillion; from a strictly economic standpoint, would it have made more sense to not address the virus and let it run rampant?","answer":"No, because consumer behavior would have changed. Many, many customers would stop going out to eat regardless of a rule saying not to do so. Same for movie theaters, and lots of other retail. Travel would still be down.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing not employee behavior. How many minimum wage employees keep showing up if their highly replaceable job might kill them?\n\nThere would still have been a massive contraction of consumer spending. And as the virus got worse, and deaths increased, this voluntary lockdown would increase.\n\nThis is one of the points I often make when folks complain about my state's lockdown (WA state).

He went on to say that Einstein is one of many who made the mistake of thinking that production for “use” would be entirely different than production for “profit”, because he never took the time to understand how and why profit is created in the first place by entrepreneurs and savers. Production for profit essentially guarantees that in a free market the means of mass production will be used to satisfy the most amount of consumers, whereas production for “use” basically means the advocate wants to personally designate what is and isn’t useful\/ should be put into mass production. It is the classical line of thinking against voting with your wallet, which Hayek says is the most radical form of unrestricted democracy (every dollar is a vote cast in a ballot every second of every day), and so Einstein is accidentally making an authoritarian\/ undemocratic argument by trying to be radically egalitarian and anti-the-excesses of capitalism.

{"question":"I've never liked tipping just because plenty of companies make billions from the service they provide, and I think they should be the ones paying more. It's the business that takes advantage of the employees, the customer, and possibly other businesses. This happens with ride-sharing apps, delivery apps, restaurants, bars, you name it. Oftentimes these businesses charge pretty dang high too. So why make the customers pay twice for the service? Also, why do people think it's rude not to tip?","answer":"My old bosses used to take part of the tips from our servers (who made 2.13\/hour) and they did nothing to earn them. Also let it be known that they get a salary too. I hate tipping mainly because it gives the workers this “I am entitled to a tip” mindset, which shouldn’t even be a thing because they should make wages they can live on like most countries that aren’t the US. Plus, the food I cook is better (To me) than anything I can order at a basic restaurant that uses microwaves for everything or charges a price that is way too expensive for what is served. I do enjoy eating out on occasion, but I just don’t like the whole culture of pressuring people to tip."}

{"question":"I live in Japan. Right now the yen is really weak, so you’d think things would be really expensive. But they’re not. There’s been minimal inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, over in the US the dollar is super strong right now. Which should make things cheaper… but they’re not. There’s massive inflation.\n\nThese two forces are literally reinforcing each other and making prices completely out of sync between countries.

There are several factors. I'll talk about the US:\n\n1\\. A lot of inflation was caused by the easy-money policies of the Fed in 2021. That creates domestic inflation which is not easily compensated for by cheaper imports.\n\n2\\. In the US imports only make up ~13% of GDP. Then you have to remember that the USD has not risen so much. The dollar index is up ~11% comparing the start of the year to today. So, at the most an 11% reduction in 13% of purchases.

{"question":"Everything I can find speaks very positively of them, but in practice they are extremely rare. And even the areas that implement them seem to often repeal them.\n\nWhat am I missing here?","answer":"[William Fischel](https:\/\/economics.dartmouth.edu\/people\/william-fischel) gives two reasons in *Zoning Rules*:\n\n&gt;One reason is administrative. The difficulties of disentangling land value from present and past owners’ contributions of capital and labor are not just theoretical (Steven Bourassa 2009). In order to apply a land tax to a parcel, the value of the parcel must be assessed by a public official. [...] Most land of any value within a community already has something attached to it and is already subject to taxation.\n\n&gt;To administer a land value tax, local assessors have to distinguish the value of a home or office building from the value of its underlying land. For many assessors, this task makes as much sense as trying to separate the value of the first floor of the house from the second floor. (Practicing assessors said as much in Daniel Holland [1970].) The building and its land “are intimately related—that is what makes them collectively “real” property—and they are almost always sold as a unit. The sales of vacant lots in some communities, occasionally resulting from “teardowns” of existing homes, offer some basis for comparisons on which land values could be assessed (Dye and McMillen 2007). But vacant land is often so special in its situation (there may have been some unusual reason it remained vacant or the previous building was demolished) that assessors are naturally skeptical of using it as a basis for assessing other land.\n\nAnd in Pittsburgh, where such a system was implemented:\n\n&gt;voters nonetheless rejected their longstanding tax system after a countywide reassessment revealed to voters that a small and a large home in the same neighborhood could have the same land values and thus pay close to the same amount of taxes (Bourassa 2009). But such disparities are inherent in any system of land value taxation and are indeed one of its supposed virtues, according to economists. The owner of the small house is not discouraged from building more rooms, as would be the case under a normal property tax system. Popular feelings about the fairness of property taxes—people in larger houses should pay proportionately more—seemed to have trumped such issues.\n\nSo in brief, they are difficult to implement and perceived as unfair. There are also more exotic critiques of land value taxes, e.g., [Gochenour and Caplan (2012)](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1999105)."}

{"question":"I understand the basics of what caused the bubble. Subprime mortgages being rated higher than their worth by investment banks believing housing prices would continue rising, even if homeowners defaulted on their mortgages. There’s much more complexity to the picture than I’m detailing, but what I’m most curious about is what finally popped the bubble. What news leak or report or analysis finally caused housing prices to plummet.","answer":"The bulk of the mortgages making up the CDOs in the 2008 crisis were adjustable rate loans which would change as the market moved. These loans were offered out to consumers at teaser rates that were incredibly affordable, then after several years the rate would expire and a more market appropriate rate would kick in, often 2 or 3 times larger than the teaser rate. \n\nThe mortgage industry ramped up heavily in 2004\/2005 and peaked in 2006. In 2007 the teaser rates started to kick in, meaning people who were hypothetically paying $600 per month for a mortgage would suddenly find themselves owing $2000 or even more. That lead to foreclosures which lead to CDOs having reduced value as the mortgages backing them up dried out and stopped paying. \n\nSince large banks had taken on not only CDOs but synthetic CDOs, or CDOs of CDOs, their profit generation became dependent on mortgages not defaulting. They used the massive amount of expected income from CDOs to leverage their money and were essentially operating on credit rather than making deals backed by actual cash. \n\nEventually in 2008 default rates on mortgages hit the point that suddenly many CDOs were now expecting to make less money than the banks originally paid for them, making them worthless and an actual drain on their accounts. Once this moment hit in the first quarter of 2008 every institution looked at their books factoring in the new default rates and realized the majority of their products were worthless. Add that to credit default swaps that basically every bank held against each other pretty much every large bank realized they were tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in debt when they expected to make money that year. That realization in the summer of 2008 is what popped the bubble as they tried to unload debt on to other banks.\n\nThere was no one moment where everyone realized. The writing was on the wall for 2 years and people only started to open their eyes and accept reality very slowly."}

{"question":"I am interested to know how cities like NYC and London transformed from what they were in the 60s\/70s \\[low cost of living, small, independent businesses\\] to what they are now \\[high cost of living, chain stores\\]. What are the primary forces behind these transformations, and are they changeable?","answer":"Let's separate this into two questions. First, why have cities grown so much? And secondly, why have living costs in cities risen so much? Edward Glaeser has done a lot of great work on this topic--and if you want a longer read, you can check out his book \"Triumph of the City\".\n\nFor some shorter reads, [this New York Times article](https:\/\/economix.blogs.nytimes.com\/2009\/05\/19\/why-has-globalization-led-to-bigger-cities\/) explains that cities facilitate information flows and knowledge sharing that make workers more productive. Some of his academic studies on this include [this 2001 study](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w4728.pdf) (showing that cities increase the productivity and skill development of workers, leading to higher wages) and this [1992 study](https:\/\/www.journals.uchicago.edu\/doi\/abs\/10.1086\/261856).\n\nWhy have cities become so expensive? Not all cities have--many of them actually remain quite affordable. The cities that have seen skyrocketing costs are due to a [constrained housing supply](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dataisbeautiful\/comments\/g4bdb0\/oc_the_increase_in_us_housing_prices_relative_to\/fnwed99?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), primarily from land controls and excessive zoning regulations.\n\nAs a simple example, Glaeser told the story of three housing markets in one of his papers:\n\n&gt; In lightly regulated housing markets with growing population and economies, like Atlanta, the supply curve for housing is relatively flat. Thus, as demand for housing expands over time, the result is that competition in the home building industry holds the price of housing reasonably close to its minimum profitable production cost. In heavily regulated housing markets with growing economies, like the San Francisco Bay area, the supply curve for housing slopes up. As a result, additional demand for housing translates into prices that are substantially above the minimum profitable production cost, with rising land values driving up total costs. Finally, in a housing market like Detroit where the demand for housing declined sharply over time, the supply curve for housing has a kink at the existing level of housing because housing is durable and does not diminish quickly when demand falls. As a result, a reduction in demand leads to lower prices for housing and minimal new construction \n\nTo illustrate this, I made a [chart here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/26vbMLJ) showing the changing prices in those three housing markets."}

If the federal reserve’s target rate is 2%, how did they allow the inflation to get so out of control?","answer":"The 1970s and 1980s saw a paradigm shift in economic thinking about inflation. The phenomena that existed at that time is called \"Stagflation\" because there was both inflation and high unemployment at the same time. According to the dominant theory at the time (Keynesianism) this should not have been possible. Monetarism was the new theory that did a much better job explaining the stagflation of the 70s\/80s.

If you buy the call option from me it means that I have to sell you my BMO share for $105 (only of you want to buy it).\n\nIf BMO jumps to $106 you can buy my share for $105 and immediately sell it on the market for a $1 profit. But you paid me $3 for the contract so you lost $2. \n\nIf BMO drops to $90 then your option expires worthless and you lost your entire $3.\n\nOptions are generally traded in lots of 100 shares."}
{"question":"You see this in pretty much every macroeconomic decision the government makes… it’s a way to squash or manage demand when in theory you could turn an inflationary economy into a boom by producing more goods, right?

{"question":"I have been investing in the market since high school. My first few years I was just day trading, in and out of this stock and that listening to what anything on the internet was saying. I invested in two companies that were completely broke  and eventually went bankrupt losing entire investments. Then I started to listen to Warren buffet and the books he recommended and slowly got better but still loved to gamble in the “sure” things online.  Anyways the last couple years I have been killing the market.. a little under 40% CAGR. I think I’ve finally have a decent investing philosophy. This last month it all paid off as the stock I have been investing in for years went up a little over 40% giving me a $19,000 gain in a month. This was a weird feeling because it was awesome but it really didn’t feel like I was 19,000 richer. Just kind of seems out of touch. Has anyone else experienced this feeling after having their first great payout?\n\n\nP.S I’m stoned writing this.","answer":"Yes, having my account fluctuate 20k each day due to volatility used to freak me out last year. Now I don’t even feel it. When I made my first 27k in one day I was extremely excited. Though with the market it gave half of it back but as I kept holding the stock continued to climb higher. What we’re in now is compounding growth. Congrats on this feeling may it last as long as possible. At this point now I’m not selling due to tax implications. The more I understand too the more I will continue to invest and only take out what I need. I think that is key. As when you take out just what you need you allow the money to still be invested and that where the real art lies. The art of being able to do nothing is truly a masterful trait. \n\nOne tidbit is Ethereum which wasn’t my 27k day but it is one I semi regret* taking profits while it continues to go up. I didn’t need the money however I did sell it to buy another opportunity but turns out leaving it in Ethereum was the better option. Hindsight is always 20\/20 but true wealth is built by holding strong assets. And strong conviction. Cheers the the both of us as it is now swinging our way. 🍻"}

I find this (static view) hard to believe, as the boomers can't really take their wealth beyond the grave, and the younger generation will have to, by definition, acquire wealth that is passed on in due time. Is this not the case? Why are some millennials complaining when the boomer wealth simply \\_must go somewhere\\_ in a few decades?\n\nAssuming boomers cannot take wealth beyond grave, where do the money actually go? Is there a study of how wealth transfers across generation due to the passing of members of the older generation? Do they mostly get gobbled up by family, or government, or the real-estate market? Or is the wealth going to simply \"pass through\" the millennials from their inheritance straight to the debt collectors such as student loans?","answer":"Millennials (and some genX) stand to inherit about $30Trillion by some estimates.

It isn’t about the appreciation or the cash flows, which are both substandard; it’s about the deferred taxation on debt pay down.

Lack of character, or the underlying system?","answer":"It's not like \"behavioural\" factors play no role at all, but others matter far more.\n\nPrime example, China used to be a very poor country in the 80's and 90's. Do you think people just kinda \"changed their mind\"? No, China had big economic reforms in the 70's, and once they really got going, the economy started to grow and people got out of poverty.\n\nOf course being poor in the US today is different than being poor in 89's China. The point is that you need the *ability* to thrive. That goes from \"big\" factors like availability of decent jobs, a stable government and robust and inclusive institutions to smaller ones like access to schools, having your basic needs met, having decent healthcare, etc. But also your neighborhood, your city, your race, etc.\n\nAnd yes, welfare programs do help to lift people out of poverty.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/social-security-lifts-15-million-children-out-of-poverty\n\n(Obviously, not every welfare program is equally effective.)\n\nFrom a plain perspective, relatively comparable countries in Europe don't necessarily have less poverty despite their bigger welfare state.\n\nhttps:\/\/mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de\/5313\/1\/MPRA_paper_5313.pdf\n\nOn the other hand, more extensive welfare is a good candidate to reduce poverty in the US.

{"question":"I have noticed that a concerning growing amount of people believe that the current state of inflation is a fallacy, since companies are 'making record-high profits,' implying that companies are increasing prices out of pure greed.

I just want to know what you guys think.","answer":"Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level.\n\nThat's it. Does the price level go up? Then you have inflation.\n\nDoesn't matter if that happens because producer prices go up thanks to supply shortages or because someone's wish from a genie is for prices to go up, inflation is very much real completely independent of the cause.\n\nObviously corporate greed is not the whole story, companies always want to earn as much as they can, they don't just *decide* to be more greedy, something *enables* them to charge higher prices. That doesn't mean companies don't earn higher profits and that this is part of the reason for higher inflation."}

{"question":"In the fine 1964 film Goldfinger, James Bond and the audience initially think the villain's plan is to steal the gold from Fort Knox. Bond even points out the madness of this idea by calculating how many trucks would be needed to haul it away.\n\nNot so fast, Goldfinger replies. The actual plan is to detonate a dirty bomb inside the vault, irradiating the gold. In Goldfinger's mind, this will essentially destroy its usefulness for many years, and his own legally-owned gold will increase in value because it's now a scarcer resource, making him an immense profit. Bond later tells Pussy Galore that the plan is insane.\n\nWhat would actually happen if a dirty bomb went off inside the Fort Knox gold depository? Would owners of non-radioactive gold make out like bandits? If the U.S. suddenly had some urgent need to trade away highly radioactive gold, could it just sell bullion inside lead boxes?","answer":"I think this is more a science question, not an economic question. If you irradiated gold, it’s like trying to irradiate lead from my understanding. You can’t do it. You might contaminate the outside but you can just clean it. Let Lead and gold are natural shielding from radioactive material so as soon as you got the particulates off of it, it shouldn’t be radioactive. I suppose if you got the core temperature of the gold to melt and then impart a tiny radioactive particles in the liquid gold then the cost to decontaminate would go up dramatically but just a bomb with radioactive material wouldn’t be too difficult to clean up."}

{"question":"I know many people, especially in my age bracket (19-22), look forward to tax season for this reason. Some even plan for large purchases once the check arrives. Why is getting your money \"back\" something to be excited about? Isn't giving paying too much in taxes a bad thing?\n\nEdit: I appreciate all the responses. Will read through them later.","answer":"A large tax refund is more money than many people have in their bank accounts at any given moment. It is money they get at once to spend. If they had a higher deduction and got the money earlier, they would have spent it on something small and would not have the money to make a larger purchase. For some, paying extra money in taxes is like having the government be their piggy bank of sorts. \n\n\nYou are right. It is best to be financially prudent, save money well, and optimize deductions. Unfortunately, very few Americans are financially prudent. Most spend too much. Most save too little. And most don't have adequate savings to retire at a reasonable age. Paying too much in taxes is not optimal. It is not quite as bad as failing to save 15% or more of your income towards retirement, but optimally your tax refund or additional tax liability would be minimal when you do taxes. "}

{"question":"Hey guys, I was scrolling through social media and stumbled upon a tiktok video. The dude in the video was saying things like boomers at this age owned something like 25% or like 20% of the world's wealth whereas millenials own only 4%. He went on further to say stuff like that because the avg millienial earns $35000, it is practically impossible for them to own property due to boomers buying all the house and getting the prices up.\n\nHe went on to say that back then you could live without a college degree and that most people could live a decent life just working in a store or something.\n\nIs this true? Did a boomer who was in their mid 20s to 30s really have a better life than the avg person who is mid 20 to 30 now?","answer":"There are three important aspects to this:\n1. Objectively, the quality of life is probably better because we have a lot more advanced products, and the same products boomers used to have are now cheaper. \n\n2. The above is not true for real estate as the amount of land in good locations and what we consider good locations are both finite and limited. As the number of people increase faster than good housing, real estate becomes more expensive.\n\n3. We know from behavioural economics that people’s perceived wellbeing and wealth does not depend on objective levels but in relation to others. Boomers lived much better than their parents, and in relative terms they felt that they are in a better place, both in temporal sense (we live better than our parents) and in cross section (the middle class was bigger and there was less wealth inequality). However, what is middle class now (large screen TVs, two cars, airconditioning, computers, mobile phones, etc) would be upper class or simply wasn’t available to boomers when they were young. \n\n\nSo objectively, a middle class person can probably afford more stuff and less real estate than boomers, and in relative terms a millennial middle class person doesn’t feel to be in such a good position as boomers felt they were."}
{"question":"Hey guys, I have a close relative who's thinking about becoming a doctor, and I was wondering how much that pays?

Is it worth it after all the studying?","answer":"People are throwing around some idealistically high end medical salaries ITT (typical salary of GP 300K\/year? Hilarious - my GP colleagues wish this was the case!).\n\nFirst of all - medicine is still a well-renumerated job, yes.  Excellent job security - also yes.\n\nHowever please keep in mind that there is a good reason why a large majority of doctors (a) regret going into medicine, and (b) tell their children to do something else.\n\nMostly - lifestyle and length of training.  The money, whilst decent, just doesn't seem worth it to a lot of people once you factor in how miserable medical training can be, and the sacrifices it demands.  And this misery continues anywhere from \\~8-15 years after you **finish** medical school, depending on which specialty you aspire to.  As others have pointed out - there are FAR easier ways to make a lot of money.\n\nFirstly, the length of training.  To become a doctor in Australia these days (especially now that undergraduate medicine is becoming less and less common) you're looking at 7-8 years of university (3-4 years of undergrad + 4 years of medical school).\n\nWow 8 years of university.  That's tough going huh.  Oh my sweet summer children - that's the easy part.  When you graduate from medical school the pain is really just beginning.\n\nIt's not so bad if you know you want to be a GP - you can qualify as a fully fledged GP consultant 4 years out of medical school (2 years in hospital + 2 years of GP registrar training).   GP salary depends a lot on location, and the type of GP work you do.  City non procedural GPs don't make amazing money - 150-250K\/year.  Procedural GPs make more - could probably clear close to 300K if you're in the city and work full time.  The biggest money is in rural procedural - they can easily make 400K+ a year.  But that job is fucking stressful - you are dealing with a hugely comorbid population far from the support of major metropolitan centres.  As a rural GP you're often also running the local ED and doing a lot of on call.  Don't underestimate the stress of that.  Btw somebody mentioned 700K for a rural procedural GP - that person would have to be a practice owner in the middle of fucking nowhere just doing 50 skin cancer excisions a day - that level of earning as a GP is INCREDIBLY rare.  If it was easy to earn that much as a GP, everybody would do it.\n\nEdit: GPs are also the politicians whipping boys.  Politicians LOVE to cut medicare funding for GPs off at the knees - expecting them to do more and more with less and less, whipping up negative sentiments in the public about \"greedy GPs\" who are charging higher and higher gaps to their patients (well yeah, what on earth do you expect when medicare billings for GPs have been stagnant for ages + you keep removing the items they can charge for).  Having said that some of my happiest colleagues are those in GP land - but yeah, it comes with its own challenges it seems.\n\nWant to be a physician? (think: cardiologist, gastroenterologist, respiratory doctor haematologist, paediatrician etc) you're looking at at least 8 years training post medical school. (1 year intern plus 1 year resident + 3 years BPT plus 3+ years advanced training then add fellowships, which seem to be becoming more and more compulsory).  The hours depend on subspecialty but you'll easily work 60+, with a lot of time outside of work spent studying \/ preparing for exams etc.  You'll also spend your best years working nights, weekends, public holidays.  Money isn't terrible as a consultant physician - 200-400K\/year if you're public.  You can earn more in private practice, esp if you're in a procedural specialty like gastro or interventional cardiology.  It's a little lower in paediatric specialties compared to adult physician specialties.\n\nSurgery? Now here is where the purest pain lies (and incidentally - the source of all my bitterness haha).  1 year intern plus 1-2 years as a resident typically then anywhere from \\~3 to infinity years as an unaccredited registrar (this is where you work in your specialty of choice but aren't actually officially on a training program yet - all surgical specialties make you do this), then (if and when you ever get into your surgical training program of choice, and it's highly likely you never will) another 5+ years as a training reg.  So you're looking at anywhere from 10-15 years post finishing medical school before you're a surgical consultant these days, unless you are some combination of lucky \/ gifted \/ well connected.\n\nDuring all that time as a surgical registrar\/PHO you're making okay money (between 110K-150K \/ year) but, depending on specialty, they can be miserable years.  Nights, weekends, public holidays.  Spending thousands a year on exam prep.   Working 70-120 hours\/week depending on specialty.  During your years as an unaccredited registrar you're also spending all your spare time (haha what spare time?) publishing garbage low quality research, doing Masters and PhDs, trying desperately not to piss anyone off and smiling through the systemic abuse so that Senpai RACS (or RANZCO, or RANZCOG) will notice you and let you onto the program.  I managed 7 months as a surgical subspecialty PHO before I saw the writing on the wall and resigned.  My accredited registrar was PGY-12 before he got onto the training program.  That's 12 years as a doctor, and he has another five to go before he's a consultant.  No thanks.\n\nIf you are the special type of person who manages to make it through the surgery hellfire (mostly high functioning sociopaths these days as the emotionally normal people tend to self select out, although there are exceptions and some truly lovely individuals do exist in surgery) you're going to make a lot of money - private surgeons in particular can easily clear a million a year.\n\nPsychiatry is a good lifestyle choice - you can be a fully fledged consultant psychiatrist within 6-7 years of finishing medical school and they can clear 400-600K publicly and even more privately.  It's extremely well renumerated - this is mostly due to high demand, low supply.\n\nI'm not as familiar with the critical care specialties like ED, anaesthetics, ICU.  ED is oversupplied however so difficult to get FTE boss jobs - also you'll do shift work forever.  ICU - my god the training is gruelling, it goes forever and is academically incredibly rigorous, oh and there are no jobs.  Anaesthetics is a pretty good gig especially if you can score a sweet private job doing high throughout lists like scopes, cataracts etc - you can clear a million a year no problem.  Competitive entry though.\n\nIf you go through my post history you can read more ranting and raving about what I dislike about medicine and how a mere seven months as a PHO in a surgical subspecialty traumatised me - I'm prone to histrionics on the topic so forgive me for that.\n\nI'm still glad I'm a doctor though and I don't regret it - I find it rewarding, the job security is fantastic and it's well renumerated.  But there's a huge cost.  I spent a lot of time at university, I miss a lot of time with my young family that I know I'll never get back (that's the hardest one), I have been driven close to suicide by the emotional and physical demands of the job before in terms of the hours and stress (I'm okay now that I've left surgery), I spend a lot of my time outside of work studying and doing post-graduate courses etc.  There are easier ways to make this level of money."}

Increasingly broad public views that social media is toxic is a leading indicator of future adoption and growth.\n* They are facing increasing regulatory and antitrust scrutiny, which means they won't be able to just buy another instagram in the future. Additionally, they will face risk from potential antitrust drums, which are now beating from both sides of the political aisle. Even without idea of breakup, additional fines and laws have been a thorn in their side.\n* Metaverse has no prospective path to profitability right now, and is more of a buzzword than an actual thing. VR will clearly have a lot of applications, many niche, but building an entire actual metaverse ignores a massive amount of roadblocks to doing so.\n* Social media adoption growth has likely peaked globally, making Facebook more of a mature company who has to deal with competitors without the ability to buy those competitors. Not a good place to be on a long term perspective when you have a lot of customers who only use your product because there is not a good alternative.\n* Network effects work both ways. They're very defensible and cause lots of people to hop on board so long as a product is popular and growing. But the same is also true in the opposite sense - when people are jumping offboard, the value proposition that comes from a network that nobody uses or has low social value can cause things to really crash fast. I think this is a bigger risk than people realize, and it's something that I don't think I've ever seen discussed online.\n* Apple's privacy changes were a gamechanger from an advertiser perspective (I work in advertising) and lots of people have been pulling ad budget away from Facebook due to not being able to target in such a focused manner. Facebook's previous targeting was far better than what you would get on other ad platforms online, which is part of why it was very popular.

{"question":"I apologize in advance for how morbid this post is. I am in no way supporting this, I'm merely curious. \n\nLet's hypothetically say that when covid-19 first started, the U.S. decided to do nothing and simply let the disease run it's course and kill anyone that was vulnerable. In March, the Imperial College of London estimated that without intervention, as many as 2.2 million Americans would die. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety places the value of a human life at around $10 million dollars. By this calculation the 2 million excess deaths would cost the economy $20 trillion. \n\nHowever, most of the deaths would be senior citizens who are at the end of their working life and have no more earning potential. Their remaining assets would likely be transferred to their families after death. Covid-19 has already cost the US $16 trillion; from a strictly economic standpoint, would it have made more sense to not address the virus and let it run rampant?","answer":"That's a pretty big hypothetical...

{"question":"I'm an Indian btw and I have had this question for a while. At  least affordability wise this decision will bring poor countries at par with developed countries and international trade will neither be a rip off for developing countries nor a steal for developed countries.","answer":"What you are referring to is known as [currency substitution](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Currency_substitution), or more specifically - dollarization. There are a number of reasons why this would not be an optimal approach to solving wealth inequalities between countries, here are the main ones:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Maintaining control of your own currency allows you to exert direct influence on the economy by setting interest rates, engaging in quantitative easing, and to some extent impacting exchange rates. This is [discretionary monetary policy](https:\/\/pocketsense.com\/discretionary-monetary-policy-6973567.html). By using the USD, the Indian government would be ceding that control to the US government. The Indian government has no power to print the USD, so the only way it could attain more is through maintaining a trade surplus with countries that primarily use the USD. Without enough exports to these trade partners, the supply of USD may fail to match the demand leading to a lack of liquidity and deflation. This is the opposite of what you envision. Without commenting on Indian politics, it seems as though India has managed to implement discretionary monetary policy [somewhat successfully](https:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/bppdf\/bispap31g.pdf).\n2. Having your own currency is a form of competition. While the INR has devalued considerably [over the last 10 years](https:\/\/getmoneyrich.com\/strength-of-currency\/#INR-USD-Exchange-Rate), the weaker INR actually boosts export profitability and increases domestic demand, spurring economic activity and growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrency substitution doesn't always work out. Take a look at the EU as a prime case. Southern, Central, and Eastern European countries have been severely affected by fiscal crises and currency devaluation. The implementation of the Euro has led to a [divergence in income equality](https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/sites\/info\/files\/dp008_en.pdf) between these member states and richer ones such as Germany, the UK, France etc. In these states, costs have dramatically increased and [locals have been forced to emigrate](https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/13608746.2017.1413051) in the hopes they can earn enough money abroad to survive."}

But the number of billionaires is also affected by the the income and wealth distribution in the country, especially at the top end of the distribution. A [recent study](https:\/\/www.adb.org\/publications\/sources-income-inequality-comparison-japan-and-united-states) found the Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality) much higher in the United States (0.453) than in Japan (0.329), corroborating previous findings.\n\nThere are several possible contributing reasons as to why Japan has a far less unequal income and wealth distribution at the top. \n\nFirstly, a combination of the widespread destruction of WWII, the forced land reform under McArthur (which greatly reduced large land holdings), the high inflation after the war (which decimated the value of financial wealth), and the very high economic growth rates after the war, meant that wealth in the new post-war society predominatly evenly spread among the new large middle class and upper middle class working people.\n\nSecondly, Japanese business culture is more corporativist and less individualistic. There is the expectation that you treat the company and the company treats you as family. Large wage discrepancies are not socially acceptable, and CEOs are paid far less than in the US or UK. The [ratio of CEO compensation to median employee pay is 265 in the United States, 201 in Britain, and 58 in Japan](https:\/\/www.willistowerswatson.com\/en-VN\/Insights\/2019\/12\/ceo-pay-landscape-in-japan-the-us-and-europe-2019-analysis). This video gives an interesting insight into japanese corporate culture: \n[Japan CEO Takes The Bus](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PjeTTQKRfWU)\n\nLastly, perhaps because of the corporativist culture, [Japan has very little entrepreneurial activity](https:\/\/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu\/article\/the-entrepreneurship-vacuum-in-japan-why-it-matters-and-how-to-address-it\/). This means far fewer 'self-made' billionaires, who make their fortune from creating 'unicorn companies'."}

A lot depends on the inflation index used to calculate real wages. Statistics showing stagnant wages are often using CPI, which likely overstates inflation. Using other inflation measure show rising real wages.\n\n2. The composition of household size has changed over the years. More single households means lower household incomes even if people on average are earning more. \n\nGiven this, real wages have likely been rising. Also, non-monetary compensation has been increasing, mainly because health care costs have been rising like crazy.\n\nHowever, given that income inequality has been rising, it is almost certainly true that median wages have not been rising as fast as GDP."}

{"question":"So after my deposit today I just hit on average 1 dollar per month! Given some months will be more than others but I’m pretty happy! My first goal of investing is complete!

Also at this point in my life, I'm focused on the extent to which passive returns can cover more and more of our annual budget.

Thanks.","answer":"EDIT2: Wow this blew up while I was at work. Thanks for the love people. This is a great community.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the silver!\n\nI'll bite. Throwaway, but maybe my new FIRE dedicated account.\n\nMy wife and I have worked our entire careers in education. M\\[33\\], F\\[35\\], our first child is on the way. She has worked in K-12 and I have worked at the college level in administration. We were both first generation college students. Her parents were immigrants and mine were working poor. We both lived extremely frugally and worked through college and we met while I was in graduate school. She was already an elementary teacher at that time. During and right after graduate school I took jobs working in residence halls which paid my housing costs. In 2014 I moved cross country and took a job in Alaska that also provided housing, while also offering a substantial pay bump. My wife was finishing graduate school. The move doubled both of our salaries and we continued to live rent-free. Mind you, none of this was easy work.\n\nI discovered FIRE in 2014 after aggressively paying off student loans. Suddenly I had a lot of extra money but no desire to spend any more of it. It was just sitting in a checking account. While in Alaska we started a small business with a $3,000 investment that netted around $20,000\/year on the side. We maxed out retirement plus 403b's as we were both in education.  We also maxed out Roth IRA's. All of this possible because of living rent-free. I also used some of the extra money to start a doctoral program. In 2019 we left Alaska for a MCOL city that was booming for a job opportunity for me. Even though she took a little pay-cut, my salary almost doubled again, though for the first time in our marriage we would have to pay housing costs. We sold the business for around its annual profit to some friends because we needed to move quickly.\n\nNow I know it's not THAT fat, but we went from a negative net worth when we married in 2012 to crossing one million in investments at the end of last year. No tech, no IPO. Working in education and side hustles the whole way and actually enjoying a decent work-life balance. This year I should earn my doctorate opening many even higher paying opportunities in the future. I love my field and intend to work for at least until my expected child can get through college (hopefully for free because I am working there). I may even move to faculty at some point and take a pay cut for a 9 month contract. That would put me on track to retire around 55 with at least 4M. I get it, that is slow to many of you and only on the edge of FAT, but in between my wife can take a few years off work to take care of our child and for us that is an incredible and life changing amount of money. In reality we have coast money NOW, something that our families could never have dreamed of. As icing on the cake, the house we bought has appreciated over 100,000 in a single year due to being in the most desirable neighborhood in a fast-growing city.  We are truly fortunate, but have also worked smart and hard. The number one contributed to our net worth has been a willingness to move for opportunity. That has also opened up opportunity in our personal lives, making many friends and having many adventures that would not have been possible if we stayed close to home.\n\nIf you read all of that congratulations. TLDR: Two people working in education and mostly not burning ourselves out, prioritizing early career jobs that offered housing, willing to move, and living a relatively frugal lifestyle saved their way to a nest egg that is now over 1 million in 8 years and should keep growing over the next 20 for a comfortable FAT-FIRE in our 50's."}

{"question":"If every country went capitalist, is it possible for every nation on earth to be wealthy and the vast majority be in the middle class, be able to afford homes, car, outings, etc. or is the way economics are there must be inequality, unequal exchange, etc? could every nation be modern, could every nation enjoy the living standards of denmark? i dont want emotional input, just the raw truth.","answer":"It is very difficult to assess, because our terms for wealth differ vastly. Generally speaking, in absolute terms yes, but in relative terms (obviously) no, and it will thus never feel that way. 1500 years ago people may have asked if every nation could be as prosperous as the Roman Empire. Now every country is vastly more wealthy than that, but we don't consider everyone rich. It is not that far-fetched to extrapolate this -- though it must be noted that we would require more efficiency (less inputs) as obviously the current rate of consumption does not account for the finite amount of resources we have.\n\n\nAs for your specific items (which are useful in a way because they provide a reference point to what you consider wealth), this is difficult. Lets treat them one by one to illustrate how difficult this is.\n\n&gt;the vast majority be in the middle class\n\nThis is a relative measure. Generally, the majority of a country will always be middle class as it is the class in between upper and lower, and distributions of wealth and income often take the shape close to a bell curve. It could be that we see extreme polarization of course. But besides that, if we assume that the majority is middle class, this says nothing about whether they are worse or better off than they are now.\n\n&gt; able to afford homes\n\nDo they have to own homes or not? If not, the vast majority of humans can afford homes, as they generally live in them. The size and quality may differ (e.g. if population increases we may expect size to decrease, if technology keeps advancing forward, we may expect quality to increase) -- but how do we assess whether that is better? Is a smaller but better insulated\/structured\/less noisy home better, or worse?\n\n&gt; car\n\nThere is no reason to believe that at some point the majority of people would not be able to own cars. But, things may change. As soon as everyone owns a car, something else may be the new thing and cars may be obsolete. Plus, increased environmental or safity requirements may make cars unnaffordable again for many, but at the same time garuantee higher quality on average. Additionally, people may choose to not own cars at some point.\n\n&gt; outings\n\nDefine outings please; how I understand this word the vast majority of people have outings on a regular basis - even many of the very poor farmers I have worked with are able to visit family or spend a day off every now and then. The ''quality'' of those outings differs very much however from a month-long trip to a tropical paradise (unless they are living in one, obviously).\n\n&gt; nation be modern, could every nation enjoy the living standards of denmark\n\nThis is a difficult question. \"Modern\" requires a definition. As for the living standards of Denmark, it depends on which part. Again, if we think of healthcare for example, there is no reason in particular to believe the levels of healthcare there can not (eventually) be exported elsewhere. But many other factors (levels of equality, work pressure, freedom of the press, democracy) are also in large part choices and institutional developments -- it is not so much the fact that these require large scale inputs which other countries do not have, but other countries ''consciously'' make the decision not to adopt them (consciously is an iffy term here, there is obviously some path-dependency and the decision is often not made by the people but by those in power, but the point is that even if the economies of the world completely stop growing or shrinking, adopting these standards should be possible).\n\n&gt; the way economics are there must be inequality, unequal exchange, etc?\n\nThis is the only question with a clear answer: no. But important to remember here is the fact that a) everything is a trade-off and b) implementation can be difficult. For example, theoretically, it is definately possible to make everyone equally well-off. Practically this is very difficult however. Plus, forcing equality may lead to a situation where everyone is worse off (this is why we see forms of the [original position](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Original_position) returning so very oftenly -- it may be better for those worst off to accept some inequality, and it is something we could argue they should, or at least could, agree to). In general, however, inequality is as much of a choice as it is a design. If we think of the global situation right now, rich countries investing large sums of money in the poor countries will level the playing field and may help overcome poverty traps leading to positive returns even for the country of origin. But these returns may not materialize and in general, in the short-term, the rich countries will lose out. \n\n\nThink of that last point in this manner; if you think cleaners are often not payed enough, you could launch a bid for the cheapest cleaner and then actively decide to pay them more. Will you do that though? If you are forced to do it instead, this may lead to inefficiencies, plus it largely limits your freedom. As for the \"raw truth\", please note that I am not juding which is better, I am merely pointing out the trade-off.\n\nIn short; it is a very difficult question to answer. Predictions are generally difficult, but for us to consider this question we need a very well-defined reference point as to what is a ''wealthy'' country."}

{"question":"Hi guys,\n\nInflation in Japan is currently the lowest in the world at something around 0.5%; my question is as every other country is struggling with unprecedented levels if inflation not seen in 3 decades, how is Japan managing to keep their inflation so low? Also, would you argue that this is a good thing? How is their employment level, wages, inequality, housing prices, stock prices etc...\n\nThanks in advance.","answer":"Low inflation isn't a good thing (and neither is high inflation). The Japanese government and central bank have been trying to raise inflation for years. \n\nSome inflation encourages consumption and lowers the cost of debt. Central banks usually target an inflation rate of 2%.\n\nI'm no expert on the Japanese economy but their ageing population is a reason. Also, when inflation is low people expect it to stay low, making it harder to actually increase it!   \nMost countries are facing the opposite problem now. Because inflation has been high for quite a while, people will expect inflation to remain high and start demanding higher wages, reinforcing the inflationary effect."}

{"question":"At some point every year, my father will complain about how the price of bacon has risen by a ridiculous amount over the previous year. The problem is that his previous-year basis is always $3.50\/pound, so after a few years his perception of a year's worth of inflation is absurd. (I found [a source saying bacon hasn't been $3.50\/pound since 2006](https:\/\/www.usinflationcalculator.com\/inflation\/bacon-prices-by-year-and-adjusted-for-inflation\/), which matches my memory.) This becomes supporting data for  his belief that the economy has gone to hell in a handbasket since the previous year every year.\n\nWhile this is a very micro-scale thing, I have to wonder if stuff like this adds up to having larger-scale impact if enough people form their beliefs about and attitudes toward the economy, and whether false beliefs about more significant stuff (like the belief that all real estate always increases in value) have large-scale impacts.","answer":"Yes there is work on this- and I hope someone posts examples regarding the examples you posted, but incorrect beliefs driving behavior shows up a lot in fields I study, such as development economics, which are probably not the ones you are thinking of. There is a whole literature on economies stuck in equilibriums of social norms\/beliefs that actually do not persist anymore in society. I can find some seminal papers and link them here, but one paper that comes to mind: [Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs](https:\/\/scholar.harvard.edu\/nunn\/publications\/why-being-wrong-can-be-right-magical-warfare-technologies-and-persistence-false)\n\nSome examples that from fields I work in that immediately come to mind:\n\nWomen's labor force participation remains very low in developing countries, which has microeconomic implications on their well being and macroeconomic implications obviously because it effects labor supply. One paper shows that in Saudi Arabia- where men have to give permission for women to work in the market- many men do not grant this permission because they *incorrectly perceive* other members of their community to shun this behavior, even though their community actually has more pro women's labor force views. But because everyone individually has false perceptions over social norms, they dont let their wives work. correcting those beliefs leads to substantial increases in womens labor force participation ([link](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/aer.20180975))\n\nOther examples: sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by stalled fertility transitions- aka families have many kids, which many consider not so good outcomes because of its connection to lower investments in their human capital (its expensive to educate 8 kids vs 2 kids)- which stagnates growth, and is tightly linked to [lack of female autonomy](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/pandp.20181085) over arguably the most important decisions in their lives. incorrect beliefs play a factor in these decisions, and when corrected, we see huge changes in behavior that are sometimes more effective than typical interventions:\n\nWomen have persistent incorrect beliefs about the effectiveness and cost of contraceptions, and simply informing then of the true effectiveness may be a much more effective and less costly policy of allowing women to reach their desired fertility ([link](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w27271)\n\nMen in these countries tend to have incorrect beliefs about the maternal risks of pregnancy, and that drives much of their desire for wanting more kids than their wives.

{"question":"So, I recently learned that banks don't need to have the money on hand to lend it. This seemed reasonable to me given that they had reasonable confidence in future payments being able to cover the cost of the new loans, but then I learned that banks will literally create money in this process. Specifically I'm talking about Australia and USA here.\n\nSo, when a banks lends let's say 300k out and receives 360k back, does this mean that the bank profited not 60k (the difference) but rather 360k because the 300k never existed in the first place?\n\nAs an additional side note, what are the consequences of this 'new money' if this is true. This seems like it would be a driver of inflation to me.\n\nThanks for the responses.","answer":"When banks create money out of thin air for loans, they create an asset and a liability on their balance sheet.\n\nAn asset, because the debt is something the borrower has to pay back, and a liability because of course the bank has to pay out that money to the borrower as well.\n\nSo if the principal of the loan is paid out, the bank \"loses\" the loaned money, if the loan is paid back, it gains that money back. Point being, there is no *net* gain from the principal of the loan.\n\n&gt;As an additional side note, what are the consequences of this 'new money' if this is true. This seems like it would be a driver of inflation to me.\n\nYes, that's kind of the point.

By some estimates, housing a homeless person and providing them with a caseworker to see to their needs costs about $10,000 a year. That means for less than a billion dollars a year, chronic homelessness could be ended in the U.S. If temporarily homeless people were housed in temporary housing, and if each temporary residence were occupied half the time, homelessness of all kinds could be eliminated for about $10 billion a year. That’s less than a seventh of what the government spends on food stamps.","answer":"Theoretically, this is true, and I think practically it's mostly true. The only trouble is that the 500,000 people you're referencing are not all in the same location, and the U.S. is a federal system, meaning we give a fair amount of  autonomy to state\/local governments. This would make such a program difficult to administer holistically. \n\nIt could be done, but it would probably take a while to fully realize the results between zoning all the housing, contracting to build said housing, creating advertising campaigns for the program, employing people to manage the housing and services, etc. However, at the end of the day, the issue of homelessness is a surprisingly affordable problem to solve, and it's a shame the U.S. doesn't make a more concerted effort to tackle its homeless population. \n\nOne of the more interesting things about speaking with someone I knew from Sweden: they had never even seen a homeless person until drove out of the airport after landing... in the U.S."}
{"question":"Hi all, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking at some companies and one has a market cap of $14B usd, cash on hand of $10.4b and debt of $4B. I'm a bit puzzled why a company would acquire such amounts of debt when they can just pay it off and fund it with cash on hand. It's a Japanese stock so inflation has been flat mostly for the last ten-twenty years so it hasn't been evaporating from the balance sheet but still, I don't know why they'd finance with debt instead of cash. \n\nCan someone help me out?\n\nThanks and kind regards","answer":"Because debt is super cheap right now.  Let's look at this at a smaller scale when it makes sense.  Say you want a new car, and you can get a 2% interest rate.  Instead of paying $30k up front for your new car, you take on debt.  Your $30k can earn you money in many other ways and exceed the interest on your debt.   \n\nIt's not all that much different for a company.   Debt lets you leverage your money. Cheap debt can be a very smart move.  When you analyze financials, you often want to be looking for companies that are utilizing debt effectively; the company you're looking at appears to be doing so."}

Lucid motors having more market value than Ford. I don't understand how a new company selling less than 1000 vehicles can be more valuable than Ford which sells a F-pickup every 35 seconds.\n\nIs there something I don't know? What am I missing out? Or I can am freaking out for no apparent reason?\n\n\nEdit 1: Thanks all for the feedback. I guess it is not that big of a deal. Will invest in stages rather than putting the whole lot. (maybe after a crash I will do that 👌).\n\nEdit 2: DCA it is","answer":"Yes, according nearly all the metrics like CAPE, forward P\/E, P\/E the US market is overpriced and we are getting closer to 2000 levels with CAPE.\n\nHowever, if you look at US mid caps, small caps they look ok and many foreign markets including Europe are reasonably priced. So, if you are looking for a 'correction' look at what happens around the 3 Fed intrest rate hikes next year, but it is unlikely that these corrections will be more than 10 - 15%. \n\nAs for the Buffet indicator I think it should only be used together with other indicators as a lot of companies listed in the US do buisness abroad and have made many aquistions of foregin companies in the past and how do you calculate ADRs into this?"}
{"question":"I'm new to economics, just wanted to ask who was correct in their ideas of the boom and bust cycles Hayek or Keynes? Was only one correct? We're both correct in ways? Please explain! Thanks!!!!!","answer":"Both were wrong in many ways and correct in a few. \n\nIn terms of business cycles, Keynes was \"more correct\". There is a reason that the standard macroeconomic model of business cycles is called the New Keynesian model.\n\nThere are grains of truth in Hayek's theory of business cycles. There has been some research in the role of credit on crises, but it's far from the dominant role that Hayek speculated it would be. \"Credit cycles\" would be the phrase to google if you want to find modern research on the subject.\n\nSpeaking in broak strokes, a Keynesian theory would predict that recessions are abnormal deviations from the 'true' path of GDP due to demand shortfall and that, once demand recovers either over time or due to government intervention, GDP will return to its 'normal' state. On the other hand, a Hayekian theory would predict that recessions are natural 'corrections' that occur when GDP is growing 'too fast' due to government intervention.\n\nIn the former case, we would expect to see that large recessions are typically followed by large expansions; if the economy drops very far from it's 'natural' path, then there will be a lot of growth as it catches up. In the latter case, we expect to see that large expansions are followed by large recessions; if recessions occur to correct GDP back down to its natural level, then larger expansions mean GDP further above the natural level and requires a large recession to correct.\n\nSo a natural empirical test to distinguish between the two is: does the size of the recession predict the size of the expansion or is it the other way around.\n\nIn the data, the former appears to be the case. Larger recessions are followed by larger expansions, lending support to the Keynesian interpretation of things. This is often called \"Friedman's Plucking Model\" which you can google if you'd like to read the papers about it for yourself.\n\n\/u\/RobThorpe probably knows more about the exact specifics of what Hayek and Keynes theorized than I do."}
{"question":"This short post is a bit like a crisis in investing philosophy in the current market.\n\nI've been investing for a number of years, though been getting more serious over the last 12-18 months. I followed the GameStop saga, the alternative coins rage, the SPAC bubble and now the green\/ESG wave. I've come to the conclusion that good value investing should be boring. Finding solid, undervalued opportunities seems to be a forgotten thing in this market with seemingly more people chasing \"it can go up by 10% by next week because the market is going up\" attitude.\n\nAm I going mad in this market? Do you agree?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: getting a few comments about my point on GameStop ($GME). To be clear, I was lucky to be in GME in the summer when it was selling for less than net working capital. I sold out in the euphoria of January. My thesis for GME was initially a cigar butt value stock, then changed to turnaround after Ryan Cohen's intervention. Now I see it as a meme stock.","answer":"I disagree. Value investing isn't boring. The fun is in the research process. When there are literally thousands of stocks in the world to analyze, it feels like a treasure hunt. As Buffett says, it comes down to temperament. Some people think of the market as a casino where you can \"play\" a stock and make money while others think of the market as a grocery store where you can buy a stock at a discount and make money."}

{"question":"It surprises me that this point has not come up more often, or if it has, I have not seen it often. I am perplexed that congress would even consider this bill as it will obviously stifle innovation in one of our strongest economic sectors and hurt the overall economy. It has been said before and often, but the entertainment industry has failed to create a product that is worth the price they want people to pay. They refuse to adapt and innovate, and instead want the government to legislate artificial demand for a product that isn't worth the price they want people to pay. I know there are ulterior motives regarding censorship as far as our government is concerned, but I am not sure why economists are not howling and screaming about the damage our government is going to do to our economy by passing this bill into law.\n\n\/r\/economics, what are your thoughts regarding this and how can we more effectively emphasize the importance of the negative impact this will have on our economy?","answer":"SOPA is a horrible piece of regulation, but to really quantify it is tough because it crosses two disciplines (IT and economics) which are not often interlinked. \n\nIt is also difficult because a lot of the secondary effects are hard to estimate. SOPA overturns safe harbour provisions that internet communications have been built on and gives politically favoured corporations the power to take down other businesses' websites without due process. That could be a disaster or just a mild (though perpetual) risk for internet businesses, depending on how the recipients of these powers choose to use them. \n\nThe power given to judges and IP holders to stick their fingers into the internet's core infrastructure through DNS tampering could be a disaster if other countries take up the precedent and end up fracturing the internet. But even the techsperts are unsure how that would unfold and the economic impact is another layer of tea-leaf reading on top of that. \n\nEstimating the economic \/ technical damage is even harder when you allow for the fact that the internet is changing so fast and these powers are perpetual. There's no way to guess how this will affect the operation of the internet in 20 or 30 years. So it isn't a 'natural' issue for economists in that it defies quantification and traditional measures like a cost benefit analysis. But it is very important, and where we can't emphasise cold hard numbers, we can outline the potential scale of the threat. We need to be out of our comfort zones and fighting this. "}
{"question":"Forgive my lack of knowledge of economic principles. It feels like this is the most dangerous time to forgive student debt in America?\n\nMy logic is as follows:\n\n1. Forgiving debt is effectively giving households X amount of dollars back overnight. It’s an economic stimulus.\n2. Suddenly a huge swath of the population has an unexpected increase in net worth through losing a liability.\n3. They can afford to spend more.\n4. Cost of goods gets pushed up further due to high demand.\n\nWhat am I missing?","answer":"You are looking only at those households who benefit from the change. Of course, the debt cancellation will be paid for by taxes. The people who pay those taxes (and do not benefit from the debt cancellation) will have less to spend.\n\nThe government may cancel the student debt and repay it by increasing the national debt.

Trading was severely centralized in Mt. Gox and it being run as a fractional reserve put the entire market into question. \n\nWas also there during the DAO hack, the first few days were very concerning. I thought seriously of selling my Ether. After reading a lot and understanding the problem from a technical perspective I ended up buying more Ether. The way it was handled made me understand that the Ethereum community was something else and that the Ethereum Foundation had the right leadership and principled approach to make the project succeed. \n\nThis time I see not much reasons to be concerned. Tech keeps progressing and in the right direction, the fundamentals are much better than they have ever been. \n\nHere is what I see, a few disordered thoughts written from my phone: \n\nCrypto enthusiasts are rather young and with that comes impatience. How wouldn't they?! 4 years is almost 25% of their existence. So seeing how the tech progresses slower than expected can discourage many. \n\nMost people have not worked in large-scale and difficult research projects, estimating deadlines is pretty much impossible. It will always be finished later than your worst estimations. And that can discourage the not so young ones. I think the Ethereum researchers made a rookie communication mistake promising deadlines. \n\nThe markets got veery far ahead of themselves, propelled by some likely manipulation (the whole USDT always smelled like shit to me and still don't trust it) and market mania that attracts the get rich quick types.

People threw money stupidly to unfinished projects for tokens that didn't even grant ownership on the project or its future revenues (few exceptions aside, like that casino that paid dividends). Now those projects are unloading their ETH as their opportunity to cash out on their scams seems to be running thin.

The biggest opportunities to make money are always in situations like these, when the markets are not efficient.\n\nJust my 2 Szabos. "}

You have more than enough data experience from your job, and the fact that you referenced thinking outside the box is great — that’s exactly the process Econ research takes. If you want to learn more about Economics, I’d start by reading some empirical papers. You’ll likely come across concepts you don’t understand, and have to google those, but I expect an intro Economics textbook would be way below your level. To start with, I think you’d like the [Journal of Economic Perspectives](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/journals\/jep). JEP asks economists to write general-interest pieces on their speciality, so it’s less technical than the typical journal, but still incredibly interesting. If you stumble on a topic you find interesting in JEP, look for articles on that topic and learn more! In terms of data superpowers, you could look at an econometrics textbook or journal but honestly you’d be much better served doing an online data science course in R or Stata. The coolest coding I’ve done in Econ has come from [QuantEcon](https:\/\/quantecon.org) courses, though they’re more about modeling than data analysis. \n\nNow, in terms of accreditation, there’s basically no way to become a capital-E Economist without going back to school. You won’t publish without a PhD, and you won’t be a corporate economist without an MBA or a masters.

{"question":"This question came out of a discussion I had with someone. There is a proposal to build extremely small and dense (&lt;250sqft) apartments in our city. One argument is that by increasing housing supply, there will be downward pressure on rent in the city. The counterargument is that because these apartments are more profitable per square foot (~$4\/sqft vs ~$2\/sqft), other landlords will use this to justify raising rents on larger units to match the overall rate. \n\nIntuitively I can see a case for either argument but I'm not sure which carriers more weight overall. When I tried looking, the main factors I saw that determines rent is location and number of bedrooms. How would you go about gauging the actual impact of this potential construction?","answer":"This\n\n&gt;other landlords will use this to justify raising rents on larger units to match the overall rate.\n\nis equivalent to saying that you're currently paying too little for rent because your landlord doesn't know the value of the property or that rent prices are pinned down by social norms. This might be true for individual units -- it's not hard to imagine a longterm tenant having a sweetheart rental deal --, but it's generally not true for entire markets. \n\nIn practice, there are two ways where new construction can impact local rent prices (at the metro live, new supply pretty much universally brings down prices). \n\n1. Supply effects where increased housing forces landlords to compete for tenants, which they typically do by lowering prices (you could imagine other ways of competing like increased amenities, parking spaces, etc, but the main way is price).\n2. Amenity effects. Most plausibly, density allows for more restaurants, bars, public transit, and other amenities. So the neighborhood gets nicer, but this also tends to push rent price up. I would caution people against thinking this is tooo common, though because if it were always the case that new apartments lead to higher prices we would never see declining cities and real estate could get near infinite rent prices.\n\nEmpirically, the [first effect tends to dominate the second](https:\/\/escholarship.org\/uc\/item\/5d00z61m?), so you should expect that those apartments will exert downward pressure on rent prices.\n\n**BIG NOTE:** One thing that people have a lot of trouble with regarding new apartments is the idea of counterfactuals. Apartments get built where there is increased demand, meaning areas where there was already upward pressure on prices. So in most places you should actually expect to see price increases in areas with new apartments, unless there's a major construction boom. They key is that rent prices will be lower than what they would have been had the apartments not been met. You can think of a fireman analogy: arrival of fire trucks tends to be correlated with burnt buildings,, but we would never say that fire departments cause fire."}
{"question":"Maybe people are inclined to look at the past through rose-colored glasses, but it seems to be a common idea that in 1970s America, any man could graduate from high school, get a job at a local GM plant, buy a house with a white picket fence and raise a family on one income, and then retire with a full pension. Compare this to modern day America where young people graduate from college with mountains of debt, compete with 100 other applicants for minimum wage jobs, can't afford to buy a house or start a family, and are generally broke. \n\nHow close is this to reality?

{"question":"Considering the chip shortage has been going on for a year or so now, I'd expect some company to step in and start producing them. Is the barrier to entry too high? Trade secrets \/ patents? Something else?","answer":"I work in that industry. I broadly agree with the comments by XiKeqiang, Zahpow and SenorHonkachonka.\n\nSemiconductor fabrication plants (\"fabs\") take a long time to build and they're very expensive. Producers are aware that the shortage may be over in a few months. As a result it is not a good idea to start building new fabs now. By the time they're ready the shortage is likely to be over and they will have excess capacity on their hands. Most of these plants are already run 24 hours a day using shift systems, so it is difficult to increase utilization of existing plants.\n\nIt's worth mentioning how these things usually work. The supply chain is long and complicated and I will only describe a part of it. Firstly, companies produce raw silicon wafers and wafers of other semiconductor materials like Gallium Arsenide. Most things are made from silicon but a few are made from other semiconductors. These wafers along with many chemicals got to the fabrication plants and the companies that own them. The core of the integrated circuits (\"ICs\") are then built using photolithography on the wafers. Many units are built from a single wafer. It depends on the size and complexity of the product. At least hundreds, often thousands and sometimes tens of thousands for low complexity products. They are not the finished product. To create a complete chip the piece of silicon is packaged in an enclosure, usually (but not always) made from epoxy resin. Mostly a package like this contains only one piece of silicon though some contain more. This package has wires in it to connect the piece of silicon beneath to the outside world. On the outside there are pins or pads. Then you have a completed chip. (Many in the industry don't like the word \"chip\" and call it an \"IC\" or just a \"part\").\n\nCOVID interrupted nearly every stage of this process. Many plants along the way could not run for periods of time. That includes the fab plants, the packaging plants and testing facilities. Supply chains often span several countries which makes things complex. If one of them has particular severe COVID restrictions then that creates a knock-on effect for the rest of the process. For example, one of the products I worked on a few years ago was like this.... The fab was in Taiwan. The completed wafers of circuits were then sent to the Philippines for testing. The chips were then sent to Malaysia where they were cut out and packaged. Then they were sent back to the Philippines for final testing in their finished state. The two testing steps were done by the same company, but the other steps were done by different companies. The company that designed the chip did not manufacture it, though it did the testing.\n\nAlso, at present there are shortages of the raw silicon wafers which are the input to the rest of the process. This is upsetting everything even in place where there weren't other problems.\n\nLastly, you have to remember that most electronics uses lots of chips. Open up a laptop and you'll see lots of them, dozens at least. The same is true if you look in the computers of a car. The problem is that a shortage of just one model of chip can make it impossible to build an entire product. It is usually not simple to replace a chip in an existing design with a different model or one from a different company. The producers must also maintain production of a very large number of different products. Some companies sell about 15,000 different models of chip, for example."}

Both are now FTE roles with standard bonus\/LTI structures.\n\nBoth employers don’t know directly about each other but do know that I have “side gigs”.\n\nMost of the time both are a 11am-3pm commitment and at the worst (~10% of the time) they are a combined 11am-7pm commitment. I do VERY ruthlessly block off time on my schedule for both companies. On each week I block off 2 days for a “heads down” session for each job (tues\/thurs is “job1 time” mon\/wed js “job2 time”). This allows me to focus on work for the other job without meetings. When meetings truly overlap… I often join both on mute and selectively choose when to contribute to the conversation by playing the “who do I mute” game. Both are full remote roles with a culture of cameras off on zoom.\n\nDuring the start of Covid my 2nd job was a “burn and churn” company. It ended up consuming 60hrs\/week and I couldn’t do hardly any real work for 8-9months for my primary job. Calls on weekends etc. work life balance was not respected so I left the 2nd job to find another at a more lax company. When I put in my notice they asked to double my salary (95\/hr-&gt;180\/hr). I had to refuse because working the two was unsustainable and it wasn’t worth risking burn out for the primary or stopping the 2-job gig all together. Month or two later I found my current 2nd FTE position at a much more lax company who GREATLY respects work life balance. \n\nMy wife [F24] is also a FTE at company 2 as a SR data scientist on a sister team so often we offload to each other to share the load.\n\nOne comment here says that’s it is better to get good at one thing and stick to that to be better in the long run. I’ve heavily considered trying to seek the combined TC of both jobs elsewhere in the same field but haven’t had any luck. HR bands usually prohibit that level of comp for my age\/degree level (didn’t graduate college). Currently our HHI is ~700k TC and, although we’re both very entrepreneurial, we often can’t think of a reasonably low risk alternative for a similar comp with the same or less stress levels\/time commitment.

In particular, socialist states have always had much weaker institutions and weaker economies than capitalist states and as a result had less developed social policies than capitalist states. I suppose some in the 1960s-1980s Communist Bloc thought that by keeping ideological purity, so-called socialist states would eventually surpass capitalist states both in measures like social welfare and egalitarianism as well as economic development. But the problem then, and the problem today, is that the central planning function of a socialist state is generally associated with higher levels of government corruption and weaker development of institutions. The weak institutions present in these socialist states includes both the institutions around social welfare programs and the institutions around income tax collection (so government financing often relies on tariffs and selling raw materials produced by state-owned industry).

{"question":"With the increase in money supply, as well as general expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, combined with prolonged supply shocks due to COVID, why hasn’t the US experienced hyperinflation? If it is at least partially due to decreased consumer demand thanks to quarantine, considering most states or opening up- especially ones with large economies like California and New York- do you expect inflation to soar?","answer":"The idea that changes in money supply lead to lock step changes in prices, derives from the quantity equation of money:\n\n  MV = PT \n\nIf V, velocity, is stable, and T, total transactions, is unrelated to changes in M, then any increases in M will lead to increases in P. \n\nThe last 15 years have shown (last 30 years in Japan) that it's a fallacy to think that the quantity theory of money always holds. Krugman terms this fallacy, the idea that an increase in the money supply will always somehow cause inflation even if there is no economic overheating, [“the doctrine of immaculate inflation”](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/05\/13\/opinion\/cryptocurrency-inflation.html).\n\nThere are two issues with the quantity theory of money described above:  i) The relationship only holds in the *long run*, as M and T are related in the short run, and ii) If nominal interest rates are near zero, then velocity becomes unanchored, and money becomes as good an asset to hold as bonds (money and bonds become interchangeable). The latter situation is termed a [liquidity trap](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liquidity_trap).\n\nA better model for inflation in the short run (and in the longer run if there is liquidity trap), is that inflation changes according to the state of the macroeconomy. Inflation will tend to accelerate if the economy is overheating (aggregate demand exceeds long run productive capacity), and inflation will tend to decelerate if the economy is in a recession.\n\nTo answer your question, inflation has not happened because the economy has not been overheating. There are signs that the economy may be overheating in the near future, and so inflation will probably increase. The FED has indicated that it will tolerate some inflation to make up for the low inflation experienced in the past, but if inflation picks up too much, the FED will likely raise interest rates to damp down demand, to hold inflation near their target."}

{"question":"I'm from Kenya but have lived in the U.S. and now Southern Ireland (Rep. of Ireland). My dad who is 50 says that when he was growing up in the 80s, he remembers how Ireland was always seen as a pretty poor and violent country in Western Europe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn less than a decade, it's gone from very poor to even doing better when it comes to GDP per capita than the UK.","answer":"In the last 30 years the economy of the Republic of Ireland has grown a lot. I live there, though I'm originally from the UK.\n\nOne of the most important drivers was and is low corporation tax. The low tax was a huge draw for international businesses. Let's say you're managing a US business starting a European subsidiary in the 1990s. You know you can make a profit by copying your US business model. You want to locate somewhere with native English speakers. Would you rather locate in the UK with a corporation tax rate of about 32% or in Ireland which had a corporation tax rate of 10% in the 90s? Plus, even up until the late 90s and early 2000s wage rates in Ireland were lower or similar to wage rates in the UK.\n\nIreland is in the EU. It's in the Eurozone as well as the Common Market. That's important because it has created a uniform regulatory framework for trade of goods and services. Ireland also received funds from the EU for development in the past, though it's arguable how important that was. Ireland has always benefited from being close to the rich countries of Europe, though in the past it hasn't used that benefit well.\n\nThe stabilization of the political situation in Northern Ireland was also useful."}

{"question":"We've seen a lot of discussion lately about the impact on employment from an increased minimum wage, but are there any other potential negative effects? Are there winners and losers, or is it just beneficial all around?","answer":"[Initial research](https:\/\/evans.uw.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/files\/w23532_0.pdf) out of Seattle, where the minimum wage was raised to $13 an hour back in 2016, suggested that wages went up by around 3% but that the number of hours worked went down by around 9%, implying that the \"average\" monthly pay went down by an average of $125 per month in 2016. \n\nBut as explained in this [follow-up research](https:\/\/evans.uw.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/files\/w25182.pdf), just looking at the \"average\" doesn't tell the full picture. Of those people who already had a job when the study began, minimum-wage workers with above average experience saw an increase in their earnings, while those with below average experience didn't see any significant change in earnings. \n\nSo why was there an apparent wage drop found in the initial research? As the authors explain, that drop occurred because the rate of new workers entering the Seattle workforce \"fell significantly behind\" the rest of the state. \n\nIn other words, more experienced minimum wage workers benefited from the wage increases. Less experienced minimum-wage workers had their hours cut so much it off-set any gains they saw from the minimum wage increase. And young people looking to enter the workforce were less likely to find employment. This is just one study, but it's some of the best research we have to date. \n\nIf you're looking for \"other potential negative effects,\" you'd also have to consider that businesses might just raise prices to cover the wage increases.  [This](https:\/\/www.researchconnections.org\/childcare\/resources\/38225) research found that child care businesses reported that they would raise prices or fees (in addition to reduce hours of or number of staff) to cover the wage increases, while [other research](https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/16\/1\/102) found \"supermarket food prices were not impacted by Seattle’s minimum wage policy.\" This isn't really surprising though. Businesses where employee wages make up more of the employer's overall expenses are going to see a bigger impact from wage increases, so they'll be more likely to increase prices and\/or reduce employee hours."}

{"question":"Is economics a universal law like physics or mathematics? In other words, is what we consider \"economics\" just a byproduct of the way our particular civilization evolved, or does economics apply to all civilizations? \n\nFor example, was there inflation in Mesopotamia, recessions in Jerusalem when Jesus was around, and oligopolies in Medieval times? On an even larger scale, would it be safe to assume that any hypothetical alien civilizations (that are at least somewhat similar to us biologically) would have the same fundamental economics that we do?","answer":"I will clarify some terminology first, and then gradually move on to your questions.\n\n**Disciplines.** Economics, physics and mathematics (and philosophy, linguistics, and medicine) are disciplines or fields of study, they are not laws. Economics and physics have scientific laws. Mathematics doesn't.\n\n**Laws.** A scientific law is the formal description of a phenomenon that occurs over and over again according to a certain recognised pattern. For example, the laws of dynamics describe the way bodies move when subjected to forces.\n\n**Theorems.** Mathematics does not have scientific laws, because it is not a science in the strict sense of the word: Mathematical theorems hold independently of what happens in the actual world, and you cannot verify or disprove a mathematical theorem with an experiment. A theorem is a purely theoretical construct. Physics and Economics use mathematics, and its theorems, to build laws, which are then verified.\n\n**Universal laws in physics?** From one point of view, practically all of the laws in physics are, strictly speaking, not universally true, they hold under certain sets of assumptions. For example, a projectile moves along a parabola only if it is heavy enough and slow enough that you can neglect air resistance. Even laws that are called \"universal\" are often not universal: The \"universal\" law of gravitation does not hold in the case of very strong gravitational fields, which are better described by general relativity.\n\n**Universal laws in economics?** The same can be said of the laws of economics, they hold under certain sets of assumptions. For example, the [supply and demand](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supply_and_demand) model, and the laws and definitions that come with it, work under the assumption of a competitive market for a certain good (materials that provide utility and that are mutually substitutable) with perfect competition (anyone can buy\/sell from\/to everybody else, and people can demand and offer whatever price they prefer), and that people want to maximise their utility. Would this apply to an alien society? If the hypotheses above still hold, then yes, the laws of supply and demand presumably will still hold. \n\nOf course supply and demand laws won't hold for **aliens that are some kind of insectoid hivemind**, coordinating all of their actions towards a common goal instead of attempting to maximise utility for the individual.\n\nAbout your historical questions.\n\n* Yes, ancient societies did experience inflation, see for example this article on [inflation in Ancient Rome](https:\/\/inflationinrome.weebly.com\/inflation-in-ancient-rome.html).\n\n* Yes, [ancient societies did experience recessions](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/4pba6b\/did_ancient_economies_have_recessions\/).\n\n* Oligopolies were the norm in many pre-modern societies. For example, [guilds in the middle ages](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Guild).\n\nAll of this being said, many the of the laws of physics are arguably more universal than the laws of economics, because they require fewer, simpler assumptions.\n\n\n_____\n\nEDIT: Thank you, kind redditor!"}
