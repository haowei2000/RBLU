    "question": "Honest question.\n\nWhere is all the money?  I hear nothing but bad news about financial crisis all over the world, and it seems that there is a shortage of cash - like it is some sort of natural resource.\n\nPeople haven't stopped buying stuff.  They still need food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Taxes are still collected. Fines are still levied. \n\nSo where is all the money?  I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \n\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?",
    "answer": "(relix already hit on some of this)\n\nIt's hard to explain this to a five-year-old, because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes... \n\nAll actual \"money\" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don't argue with me yet, I'll get to that.)\n\nImagine a pretend world with no money, some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let's invent paper money. You can't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff, because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let's walk through this...\n\n- Let's say you're an apple-farmer and I'm a hunter. You want some meat but haven't harvested your crops yet. You say to me, \"hey, go hunt me some meat and I'll give you 1\/10th of my apple harvest in the fall\". Fair enough, I give you meat, you owe me apples. There's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard \"prices\" start to emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever. \n\n- Now, let's say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  \"Hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?\" You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like money. \n\n- In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman who doesn't even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish, because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time, you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest. \n\nNow, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples. The \"money\" is a transferable IOU-- your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and it's transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere. \n\nSo far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here, on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we'll address separately:\n\n- What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn't \"go\" anywhere, it's just gone, it doesn't exist. Real value was genuinely destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value-- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed. (We'll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting). \n\n- The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay, and the town wouldn't find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has been \"destroyed\" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.\n\nThe above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests. \n\nAfter the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer. Let's say the town potato-farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some murkier system. Similarly, the town drunk probably won't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold. \n\nNow we have something like a credit market emerging, and the potato-farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern \"bond\"...\n\n(continued in a reply to this post...)\n\n"

    "question": "If my underlying assumption is incorrect, please elucidate me. \n\nThat said, I know of several family members who worked as grocers and retail workers and they were able to buy their homes in the 70s and eventually paid them off. \n\nI, on the other hand, have a well-paying job, a graduate degree, and I’m also married to a partner with a great job. \n\nYet, had it not been for inheriting the equity from my grocer and retail worker relatives, I would never have been able to affordably buy my townhouse. \n\nIn contrast, similarly sized 2 or 3 bedroom apartments for rent in my area are now priced at about $3,500 a month. At $15 an hour, that would equate to 67% of a couple’s pre-tax income on housing alone.",
    "answer": "There are lots of misconceptions around this topic.\n\nHome ownership rates in general are higher now than in the 70's.\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/RHORUSQ156N\n\nThe cost of a house is also not really the plain cost of a house, it's the financing cost. And in that regard, people spend less of their disposable income on mortgages than they did at any prior point in the last 40 years.\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/MDSP\n\nThat doesn't mean houses haven't become more expensive, but that perception is in large parts fueled by the fact that they have become a *lot* more expensive in the most desirable places, the big cities that offer high salaries and a high standard of living. People talk about San Francisco, not Casper, Wyoming.\n\nAnother thing to note is that people became wealthier and in turn bought bigger houses. Houses cost more, houses *per square foot* have fluctuated, but not gone up so drastically.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.aei.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/houses2.jpg?x91208\n\nTwo trends are worth noting however.\n\nPeople on average go to college more often, spend more time on their education, and start working later. They also get married later. This means that even if they ultimately earn the same or more, this happens later in life.\n\nAlso, inequality pushes ownership rates down for the lower half and up for the upper half.\n\nFor more details, see:\n\nhttps:\/\/equitablegrowth.org\/a-generational-perspective-on-recent-u-s-homeownership-divergence-by-income-and-race\/\n\nSo, from a broad perspective, ownership hasn't changed, but who can afford what and where has changed."

    "question": "I’d like to invest in something that would generate $30000 a year. Would like to entertain as many options as possible. How about some ideas. Thank you",
    "answer": "$30K from $700K is a 4.2% SWR (safe withdrawal rate). This is well within the 4% threshold describe by the [Trinity Study](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trinity_study). I.e. you can start by taking out $30K the first year. The next year, you adjust the $30K for inflation and take that out. There is a 95% chance your money will last and a very good chance it will actually grow.\n\nThe Trinity Study used a time horizon of 30 years. Your life expectancy at 68 is 16m\/18f but you have to allow that you could live longer. \n\nA key decision though is how to allocate your money between stocks and bonds. Typical advice might be 60\/40 or 50\/50. The problem is that bonds are now at a historically low rate.\n\nA second issue is that the equity market [CAPE Shiller Ratio](https:\/\/www.multpl.com\/shiller-pe) is currently very high. This indicates that equities may be over valued and that the market is due for a correction. The further implication is that you face a larger chance for a [sequence of returns risk](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/sequence-risk.asp).\n\nThe other realistic option you have is to purchase an annuity. Just off the top of my head, I believe you could get an annuity which would return even more than the amount you want to spend each year. The problem is that the annuity probably would not be inflation adjusted.\n\nSchwab offers a fixed immediate income calculator here: https:\/\/www.schwab.com\/annuities\/fixed-income-annuity-calculator\n\nI get a rough estimate of 42K \/ year for a the situation you describe assuming you are a male. Female would pay worse due to longer life expectancy.\n\n**EDIT** I'm humbly honored by those redditors who've bestowed a number of awards on this reply. Thank you."

    "question": "More or less all stock prices have been continously falling for the last week, if not longer. The housing market sees skyrocketing prices, the price on food, gas and electricity is increasing, and subsequently the consumer spending index drops. All of this leads to an increase in inflation.\n\nAre we going to see a stock market crash and financial crisis, like the ones in 1929 and 2008? Or are things different this time?\n\nAlso, should I personally be worried that I'm not going to be able to get a job, and afford stuff like a house and a normal standard of living, once I've finished my education in 5-6 years?",
    "answer": "On this subreddit we mods don't like predictions about stock-market crashes. They are notoriously tricky, for the reason already given by another commenter.\n\nIt is fairly easy though, to explain why the current situation is so troubling. I'm going to concentrate on that.\n\nDuring the pandemic the Federal Reserve performed very expansionary monetary policy. Other Central Banks across the world did something similar. As it turned out that policy was too expansionary. Inflation was caused by various factors including pandemic-induced supply chain problems and the expansionary monetary policy.\n\nAs a result, inflation has been high for quite a while now. Over on \/r\/badeconomics Integralds gives [the path of the CPI price-level compared to the Fed's aim](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Pfn9szI.png). The price level is now far higher than the Fed's intended path. Since 2020 inflation has averaged 5.25% rather than the 2% aim. If inflation went to 0% next month and stayed there it would take *several years* for the Fed to get back to it's intended price-level path.\n\nThis leads us to the current problems. The Fed must raise interest rates to counter inflation. It must contract the money supply or at least stop it from expanding further. Raising interest rates is contractionary. It will raise interest costs and deter investment spending.\n\nThis affects the stock market in three inter-related ways. Firstly, companies can borrow less to expand, which affects their growth prospects. Secondly, stock speculators can borrow less to buy shares (margin loan interest rises). Thirdly, bonds become a relatively more attractive investment compared to stocks. (Notice, that only the first effect -probably the weakest one- applies to the wider economy.)\n\nWhen thinking about the US stock market you must remember that it has already declined a great deal. The S&amp;P500 peaked at 4818.62 on Jan 4th this year. Looking just now it is at 3742.23, that's a fall of 22.3%. Has the stock-market fallen far enough, or has it fallen too far? I have my own opinions about that, but conventional economics does not give an answer."

    "question": "Hello, \nAmerican here. Astounded at how much the pound dropped vs USD after Liz Truss’ and Kwasi Kwarteng’s speeches on tax cuts and breaks. \nImo multinationals listed in London should perform better on paper because of the decreased tax burden and oversees sales (in USD) should bolster balance sheets, however I’m curious what others thing!",
    "answer": "Economist here. The main problem is that the budget was basically a gamble. The tax cuts weren’t funded and rely on economic growth to make up the reduced tax revenue. Economic growth isn’t forecast to be very good in the short term and the UK has a low medium to long term growth forecast when compared to other developed economies. This means that there is a strong chance that the UK government will need to borrow money to pay for it. High borrowing isn’t always negative but if this happens there isn’t anything to show for it. If borrowing was high to, say, invest in renewable energy infrastructure, then the lower energy costs in the future offset the borrowing. The markets can’t see what the benefit is here. It may work and it may stimulate the economy but it is strange timing with interest rates working against it at the same time.  \n  \nTaking my economist’s hat off for a second, my colleagues are all of the opinion that the new government is displaying economic illiteracy and that in itself is fuelling the negative sentiment. I can’t comment on this though."

There are some excellent threads outlining a strong case for share counterfeiting. \n\nWhat does he think GME’s share price is going to? It was trending to the 700-1000+ easily before intervention, the gamma squeeze was happening before everyone’s eyes.

    "answer": "An attempt at an ELI5:\n\nLet’s say I tip a bartender a $1. That bartender buys a $1 drink from the deli. That deli owner uses that $1 dollar to buy something, and so on and so forth.\n\nA while lot of people are going to say they made $1. Total income from that $1 will exceed one dollar since that same dollar was used over and over again.  \n\nBut if I think, “oh, I might need this dollar later” and stick it in my sock drawer, all those transactions won’t happen. Economic activity falls. Incomes fall. Prices may even decrease as everyone on that chain of economic activity saw their income fall when I broke the chain by stuffing the money in my sock drawer. \n\nIf the Fed goes out and buys something for $1, the hope is it’ll start the same chain of economic activity my $1 did. \n\nBut the bar is closed. So it skips step one and goes and buys the drink at the deli.  But no one is shopping much, so that deli owner doesn’t want to buy stuff either, so they just stuff it in their sock drawer.\n\nSo now the Fed has to introduce another dollar in hopes of starting up the chain. But everyone just keeps sticking them in their sock drawers. \n\nYes, sure, there’s tons more dollars, but they’re not being used. \n\n$1 being used 5 times is the same as 5 one dollar bills used once each before being stuffed in the sock drawer. In both cases it’s $5 worth of transactions. Since it’s the same dollar amount funding the same number of transactions, prices aren’t going to go up. \n\nThe potential problems come later when people start spending normally and everyone busts open their sock drawers and all those dollars that had gone unused start competing with each other to buy stuff. \n\nMe, the deli owner, everyone pulls out their dollar and start bidding up the price of things. \n\nThat’s when inflation would happen.\n\nAnd the Fed’s idea is that, at this point, it starts selling all the stuff it bought when it introduced those dollars, and does so until those dollars are removed from the economy, and it’l returns back to how things were at the beginning.\n\nThat’s the goal. That’s the hope. \n\nIt doesn’t always work though. That may not be able to undo it and we’ll see the inflation. \n\nor people never bust open their sock drawers, and so no matter how often the Fed prints more and more money, nothing happens. \n\nIn fact, if people keep stuffing them in sock drawers faster than the fed can print them, the number of dollars being used could actually decrease and lead to deflation. \n\nThat’s essentially what happened to Japan in the 1990s. They kept printing and printing and saying, “your goddamn sock drawers are overflowing with cash! Go use it!” But since no one was using it, prices kept falling. Problem is, if prices keep falling, the incentive is to hold off on buying, which means even more reason to keep it money stashed in the drawer, and the cycle perpetuates. No amount of money printing will cause inflation if no one uses the money.  Stacks of in your money in sock drawer isn’t any more inflationary than your socks are. It only becomes inflationary when you spend it. \n\nThe real world is more complicated, but the general idea is the same. It’s not just how much money there is, but also whether or not (and how frequently) that money is being used for transactions that matters. \n\nSo, in the end, if activity normalizes and they can unwind, no inflation. If they they can’t unwind, inflation. If activity doesn’t normalize, potentially deflation."

    "answer": "Destinations? If you’re into Maldives, go to Velaa instead. It’s better than CB. I think Maldives is pretty boring though, St Barth offers a much more rounded paradise island experience IMO. Some argue that the CB is the best hotel on St Barth, I’d go for Eden Rock though.\n\nDo some classics, go to Paris and stay at George V. Go spend a week at FS Cap Ferrat. Spend another week relaxing in Park Hotel Vitznau before heading to MO Lake Como. Spend another week or two at FS Florence before heading to Rome for a private Vatican tour. The sky is the limit.\n\nWant to do something crazy? Charter a private jet to Antarctica https:\/\/white-desert.com\/\n\nWhy stop there? Blow 300k on a Safari with Singita, take the Belmond Andean Explorer,  go to Awasi Patagonia and spend a week or two hiking Torres del Paine. Go see the norther lights at the Deplar Farm in Iceland.\n\nOh yeah, don't forget to book Courchevel for this winter while there's still availability. Cheval Blanc is probably full already.\n\nAs far as travel advisors go, I’ll paste my previous comment below. A lot of the stuff about travel agency bookings being good value probably isn’t relevant to you but if you want the best of the best advising you, these are the right people.\n\nI could write so much about this, at this point my travel agent\/concierge service handles most aspects of my day-to-day life.\n\nI've been using [Berkeley Travel](http:\/\/berkeleytravel.co.uk), a London based agency offering services globally. They charge no fees for travel, just take the standard commissions properties offer to travel agencies. However, because of this they're not really interested in clients with annual travel budgets below 250k.\n\nIs it worth it? Absolutely. For years I used to book directly, but reading Flyertalk I eventually realised that I could save tons of money booking through somebody who has more negotiating power than me. Good agents will have contracted rates and partnership agreements with top properties, offering huge discounts and guaranteed upgrades.\n\nFor example, Berkeley is a Four Seasons preferred partner and they've managed to arrange incredible (even triple category) upgrades at multiple Four Seasons properties for me.\n\nMoney isn't the most important thing though, it's just the convenience of all of it. Before I had my PA handling my bookings for me, she's incredible but she's just not a luxury travel specialist. She'll fight for me, but she hasn't actually visited the properties I want. She's got no problem spending hours on the phone, but doesn't have direct contacts at the properties or restaurants I want to book. \n\nThe agency I work with has me in a Whatsapp group with a bunch of people able to provide expert advice within a couple of minutes. And because they actually go to the same destinations as I do, they tend to have direct lines for restaurant managers, maitre d's, etc - often enabling them to get me last minute tables even at super busy places.\n\nOverall, I think the most important thing is to avoid the big shops. The big ones like essentialist, mrandmrssmith and velocity black are all a disaster. You want to work with a small team of experts where everyone knows you and your preferences, not with a glorified amex concierge hiring hundreds of people with little industry expertise.\n\nIf you're interested in a personal referral, feel free to message me directly."

My sneaking suspicion is that they are wealthy and benefit from increasing house prices and wouldn't want anyone to know the party has to end eventually.",
    "answer": "Your question seems to be entirely focused on \"the hosing market\" in the United States, so I'm only going to speak to that. \n\nThe suggestion that \"no one\" thinks the housing market will \"crash\" is just wrong.  There are plenty of people who think that. But even though home prices have risen quickly over the past year, the idea that there will be a \"crash\" is dubious. \n\nYes, real estate can be used as an asset like stocks, silver, gold, bitcoin, etc., all of which saw dramatic increases in the last year. But unlike bitcoin, which only has value if people agree it has value, a house is also a consumable (i.e. a place to live).  So while bitcoin could crash to $0, real estate wouldn't \"crash\" in the same way because it has an inherent, useful value.\n\nLooking at real estate specifically, there are (at least) three factors  driving the increase in home prices:\n\n1. Mortgage rates are [near record lows](http:\/\/www.freddiemac.com\/pmms\/pmms30.html). When we \"[reduce the interest rates faced by households\" that will \"push prices up](https:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/cgfs64.pdf).\" That is, when mortgage rates go down a person can afford a home with a higher sticker price because their overall monthly mortgage payment stays the same.\n2. The supply of houses for sale (relative to the demand for houses) is also [near record lows](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/MSACSR). When there's less supply to meet the demand, you're going to see price increases.\n3. The US population keeps growing, but the amount of land remains the same. There are simply more people competing for the same sq ft of land.\n\nThe first two factors will let up eventually. When the economy recovers and inflation picks up, the Fed will raise interest rates and unwind its balance sheet. That will cause mortgage rates to rise, and prices to fall. But the Fed knows not too do that too quickly and cause a \"crash.\" Likewise, higher home prices will incentivize builders to create more housing and for people to sell. But it takes time to build new housing so there wouldn't be a sudden \"crash,\" and people would be less likely to sell if there were a \"crash,\" causing supply to dry up. The third factor will continue to push prices up: The population is growing and [will continue to grow for decades to come](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/content\/dam\/Census\/library\/publications\/2020\/demo\/p25-1144.pdf) (even considering the death rate for \"the average baby boomer\"), and the amount of land isn't.\n\nHome prices will almost certainly *rise more slowly* in the future. They might even go down a bit. But a decrease would likely occur slowly rather than as a \"crash.\" A \"crash\" happens when the price declines dramatically and unexpectedly. That is unlikely because (a) homes have an inherent value, like I mentioned above, and (b) none of what I'm discussing is ground breaking. \n\nI'm not saying there can't be a \"crash\" in home prices. We saw that in 2008. But it's precisely *because* we have a good understanding of what happened in 2008 that we're unlikely to see it happen again.  In spite of COVID, the current [delinquency rate](https:\/\/www.corelogic.com\/insights-download\/loan-performance-insights-report.aspx) is dramatically lower than the mortgage delinquency rate [after the great recession](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/DRSFRMACBS). A big reason for that is that lenders have been much more strict since 2008. In 2006, subprime mortgages made up [about 20%](https:\/\/www.recenter.tamu.edu\/articles\/tierra-grande\/Lingering-Effects-of-Subprime-Lending#:~:text=Subprime%20mortgages%E2%80%94broadly%20defined%20as,to%2020%20percent%20in%202006) of the overall mortgage market, whereas today they make up less than 5%. In other words, home prices may be high today, but people with mortgages are more creditworthy and are better able to afford the mortgages.  So we're less likely to see a huge foreclosure spike, meaning we're less likely to see a dramatic increase in the number of homes for sale, meaning prices are unlikely to \"crash,\" per se.\n\n**To the hundred plus people downvoting the automod and complaining you don't see any responses:** The reason there aren't any approved responses to this thread is because literally none of the dozen plus comments in the queue cite to a single source of any kind. Many of the comments are just one sentence long or say something like \"here's my take,\" \"I'm not an expert,\" I \"believe,\" or this is \"my guess.\" Rule II says: \n\n&gt;All claims (and especially claims in top-level comments) should be rooted in economic theory and empirical research - not opinions, anecdotes, lay speculation, or personal politics. It is strongly recommended that claims be sourced by citations to applicable research.

    "answer": "I was trying to track down the original article by Utsa Patnaik but I couldn't find it. Part of where that $50 trillion comes from is the \"compounding at 5%\" assumption. 5% is a very high interest rate over 250 years - £1 in 1772 compounded forward at 5% becomes nearly £200,000 in 2022.

To try and make sense of the influence of that we can look at the average flow of transfers per year between 1765 and 1938 that you'd need to get to $45 trillion with compounding to the present day at 5%; [I calculate that as $9 million per year](https:\/\/www.wolframalpha.com\/input?i=%2845*10%5E12%29%2F%28%5Csum_%7Bx%3D80%7D%5E%7B253%7D+1.05%5Ex%29), which is still a large sum, but if you change the compounding rate to 2% you instead get a total of $69 billion - almost a thousand times less than the figure Patnaik suggests. So the compounding assumption makes a big difference to the total figure.\n\nStill, is a flow of $9 million a year accurate? It's certainly true that there was a good deal of direct wealth extraction by British people from India, with a minority of British people involved with the East India Company getting filthy rich at the expense of Indians, to say nothing of the direct human rights atrocities and murder (William Dalrymple and Anita Anand's ongoing *Empire* podcast has some vivid details about what the British did in India). But there's a specific figure claimed here. Patnaik seems to equate \"drain\" with India's export surplus. Usually, exports are not a drain on a country because the countries that import the goods have to pay for them with something. The argument Patnaik makes is that the colonial setup allowed the British effectively to get exports from India without paying anything for them, so that the total value of the exports was all drained from India. Whether that's true is both an economic and a historical claim, and I don't know enough about the history to evaluate it. But [this comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/gc3ifr\/utsa_patnaik_claims_that_the_british_siphoned_45\/fp9yyx0\/) on \/r\/AskHistorians argues against the claim that all exports from India constituted drain, which would imply Patnaik is also overstating the flow of resources from India.\n\nThe 1.6 trillion people died figure is surely a typo for billion, a trillion is simply not a possible figure and it's not claimed by the other sources. The 1.8 billion deaths figure [seems to come from assuming](https:\/\/countercurrents.org\/polya201111.htm) that if the British had not ruled India, the annual death rate for India over the entire period would be 11 per 1000, which is the death rate of the US in the early 1920s; this doesn't seem like a remotely plausible assumption to me, but I'm no more a demographer than I am a historian.\n\nFinally, drain isn't necessarily the only way that Britain impoverished India. Acemoglu and Robinson have a lot of work on the importance of institutions in determining how fast a country grows. When the British were in India they set up institutions that were predominately extractive, aimed at taking wealth from the country rather than improving the lives of the people living there. Bad institutions can have persistent effects even after the British left, and may well have made India poorer by inhibiting its growth without actually making Britain commensurately richer."

When government taxes people \/ businesses there is a higher cost for whatever is taxed and therefore reduced quantity. If the government spends that tax revenue on something that promotes economic growth, then the economic growth benefits of that can even out (or in some cases even result in a net positive benefit). \n\nWhen instead individuals either impose additional costs (bribes) or cause government spending to go to non-beneficial costs (kickbacks) you get more of the negative effects and less of the positive.

    "question": "If you buy a house for $30,000 and rent for $1,500 it would take you almost 2 years just to break even. So how do people become so rich by renting by properties? And how do they rent multiple properties at once when they’re not even breaking even on the first one?",
    "answer": "It's a combination of a lot of things:\n\n1. Cash flow: after all expenses (including maintenance, operations, and debt servicing) the extra money accumulated each month. \n\n2. Loan pay down: Each month, they own more and more of the property. \n\n3. Appreciation: assuming 30,000 is the 20% down payment, the property purchased was $150,000. Gradually, the hope is for this to appreciate over time. This also works with rents. They may break even now or minimally cash flow, but over time rents generally increase. \n\n4. Leverage: going off the above point, they only paid $30,000, but are able to gain appreciation on an asset worth 150,000\n\n5. Scale: using legal tax loopholes you can trade up your property over time for larger and larger properties that can yield more of the above revenue streams at a larger scale. Trading your 150,000 building for a 300,000 building, then a 600,000 building, etc. \n\n6. Depreciation: using tax laws, property owners are able to depreciate their investment and reduce their tax burden, sometimes even more than the income the property produces. \n\nI probably missed a few, but that is the few ways why some invest and how people make money in Real estate."

If so, you can probably gloss over the emergency fund.\n4. If you do have some sort of payments you make, you will first want to put aside a couple months' expenses.  What if you get fired?  You don't want your car repossessed!  So have a backup fund like this.  Maybe you do already. \n\nNow, for investing!  You've got a couple options here.  \n\n1. Retirement - if you made this money at a job, you can report it as earnings and open up a Roth IRA.  The downside?  The money won't be available for, like, 45 years.  The upside?  It will have tremendous compounding power if you start early, and is tax-sheltered: no tax penalties when you take it out.  Vanguard is most likely the best choice for a company with which to start an IRA.  However, there's a $3k minimum, so you'll need to save a bit more.  EDIT: If you pick a target retirement date fund, the minimum is only $1k - thanks to \/u\/doomtop for catching this.\n2. Maybe you want this money back in under 45 years.  That's understandable.  In that case, open a brokerage account.  Again, Vanguard is great because you can trade all of their mutual funds for free - no commission!  See the bullet point above.  However, you'll still need a minimum of $1k to buy into their STAR funds.\n3. If you're interested in individual stocks, well, see the point above with penny stocks.  Individual stocks aren't quite like flushing your money down the drain, but they are much riskier than mutual funds, and in most cases you're wagering a limited upside against a massive potential downside.  If you're going to go this route, get it in your head right now that this money is gone.  Kaput.  Flushed.  Down the drain.\n\nI sound like a pretty pessimistic ass, don't I?  Well, I started an individual account for buying stocks back when I was a teenager.  I still have it now, half a decade later.  I put around $10k in.  It is worth $15k right now.  And unless you get incredibly lucky, you won't be generating 50% gains per year.  And if you are that lucky, you'd still be better off buying lotto tickets.\n\nNow, I've mentioned mutual funds and Vanguard a couple times.  Before you get into the market, educate yourself!  (And it's not a big leap for me to assume that you aren't, by the way - no stock pro ever trades penny stocks.)  Here are some recommendations:\n\n* Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin, especially if you want to change your emotional relationship with money.\n* The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley, especially if you have high expenses.\n* The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp; Broke by Suze Orman.\n* I Will Teach You to be Rich by Ramit Sethi.\n* The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing and\/or The Bogleheads' Guide to Retirement Planning, both by Larimore et al, which covers the investing philosophy espoused by most of r\/personalfinance.\n* A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel, especially if you aren't convinced that index-investing is right for you.\n* The Four Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein\n* Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey, especially if you are in more debt than you want to be.\n* The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason, for timeless advice.\n\nIf you only read one from that list, by the way, make it \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street.\"  Trust me, it's worth your while.\n\n**TL;DR - Don't go into stock investing chasing ridiculous gains.  Consider setting up a retirement account.  Put money into indexed mutual funds, not single stocks.  If you buy single stocks, consider that money written off.  And, for the love of god, NO PENNY STOCKS.**\n\n^my ^fingers ^hurt ^now\n\nEDIT: Changed \"interest\" to \"tax penalties\" under the IRA, thank you very much to \/u\/ajfirecracker for catching my mistake."

Which is a 50% increase in the price level per month. While what the US is seeing remains under 7% for the year, while the multi year trend has been barely any inflation at all. Moreover, pretty much everyone in economics is seeing the current inflation as mainly supply disruptions. And not a lasting trend. [The bond markets](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-12-10\/citi-s-bailin-says-bond-market-shows-inflation-is-transitory), which is the private sector entity with the most skin in the game concerning long  term or spiking inflation, is not pricing in any significant inflation expectations. \n\nBasically, people in the crypto markets don't understand economic fundamentals.

    "question": "So today I went on www.bittrex.com to create an account and deposited roughly 26 BTC and traded them for other coins. Of course before doing this I did the basic verification, phone verification and enhanced verification and the 2FA authentication. I tested everything out and everything seemed fine...  Then I logged out at 18:54:27 2 Hours later I come home and try to log in and it says that Bittrex is checking for my browser and that this might take up to 5 minutes. Few minutes later it goes through and asks me for my 2FA which I provide. Again it takes a long time and ends up failing. So I wait a bit and do the whole process again and when I finally log in I notice that everythings gone... All my coins were sold for btc and gone. So I check the history and this is what I see... NEW IP LOGIN UNKNOWN_IP_WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS NEW_IP WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS and then a few mins later I log in... so what happend?",
    "answer": "these are API calls. Most likely you logged onto a spoofed phishing site, and it sent api calls to the real site to get valid account balance info\/etc so it would look normal to you. As soon as you logged off, it sold your shit and sent it to that great wallet in the sky. \n\nThe momentary delay during your initial login was them creating the API keys that would later be used to transfer their loot out of the system.\n\n    NEW IP LOGIN \n    \n    UNKNOWN_IP_WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS \n    \n    NEW_IP WITHDRAWAL_APIV1_SUCCESS\n\nso now, you need to figure out what link you clicked on to be directed to the fake site. Was it a link in an email? If you went to the \"real site\" (via a bookmark or by typing the address in the address bar) but were phished anyway then most likely your computer is owned and you have an entry in your hosts file that redirects bittrex.com to a fake IP address that hosts an identical site.\n\nStart a command prompt as administrator and issue the following command \n\n    \"notepad.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts\"\n\non a normal system, it should look like this: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/VYsXQ\n\nIf it has an entry for bittrex, you are hacked. It will look like this http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bcRa6 this is what it would look like if they redirected bittrex to another IP address on your computer, since windows checks this file first before querying DNS (Domain Name System) for the IP Address of bittrex.com. \n\nIf it has some random IP address in there, this is the place that stole your money. You can trace the IP Address owner and submit a report to police\/interpol\/justice league\/the guy who owns the ip address. Most likely it will be some internet cafe in Shanghai or India and that's where the trail will go cold.\n\nif the hosts file looks normal, open regedit.exe and check the registry key at: \n\n    \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DataBasePath \n    \n^^^ this is where windows host file location is specified and this is where windows will look for the host file it uses to resolve names (www.bittrex.com) to addresses (104.17.156.108 &lt;- their actual ip) for your browser to actually connect to.\n\nit should look like this http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Ius1v if it isnt identical to the example I provided, you are hacked\n\nif it doesn't point to \"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\drivers\\etc\" then they have created a fake hosts file somewhere else on your system (the new path specified in the registry key), and this is truly some next level hacking shit, because your adversary is employing stealth to mask their activities. \n\nAnother easy way to tell is to compare the results of a ping command (which uses hosts + dns) to the results from nslookup (which uses only DNS). If there is a mismatch (ping is hitting a server not listed in the results of nslookup) then this is a huge red flag. Example: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FRZ1dOt.png \n\nhere is an example of what it would look like if bittrex.com is redirected to 123.123.123.123 in the hosts file: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZPAtc\nhosts file: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/uFJiA\n\n\n\nIf this is the case you will want to take the system down to bare metal, blow away the OS, flash the motherboard, flash any firmware you can with known good copies, etc *before you use it for anything else.*\n\nAlso if your computer is owned, \n\n**don't forget to change every single password in every website (from a known good computer) starting with your bank, and then credit cards, lastpass (if you use it), or any other sites where you feel that they might liberate your hard earned cash from you all the way down to facebook and twitter etc. Matter of fact, do that anyways, like now.**\n\nyou might ask for help in \/r\/netsec or \/r\/computerforensics (hint they will be more inclined to help if there is a small fee). even if your coin is  not recovered at least you will have some idea who to shake your fist at. \n\nwhen you logged in and there was a long delay, did you get a 2fa prompt? or did you submit your 2fa with the login that took a long time?\n\nHope this helps &amp; sorry this shit happened to you, if I just got janked out of a hundred grand I would already be blackout drunk, so if this is the case, just shut down all your computer stuff and deal with it tomorrow."

    "question": "https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supply_and_demand#Criticism\n\nBasically, there's two arguments here:\n\n1. Supply and demand is a tautology, or the existence of it is unfalsifiable. The labor theory of value is a better way to set prices.\n2. Supply and demand doesn't apply to modern goods, since stores set prices using a fixed markup percentage over their costs. \n\nI thought supply and demand was a cornerstone of economics, like Newton's laws are to physics, but I'm just a layperson. \n\nAre these criticisms supported by a lot of economists? Is supply and demand really in doubt? Or are these just fringe positions that aren't backed up by research?",
    "answer": "Wikipedia is weirdly a bad source for information on economics. It skews much more heterodox than what the majority of economists believe. It also tends to misrepresent orthodox economics and be weirdly out of touch with modern economics (note how most of the people the article cites are heterodox economists, economists from the 1970's or earlier and no modern, mainstream economist is cited). Anyways, in order:\n\n1. No, economic theory makes very sharp predictions about how we think markets will react to exogenous shocks (prices rise when a hurricane destroys crops is a testable prediction). And yes, we can measure supply and demand curves. I would go through this t[hread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/qflpw6\/empirical_evidence_for_core_microeconomic_theory\/) for more detail and citations. The labor theory of value has been beaten to death in this thread. No, it's still not correct. See [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/neoliberal\/comments\/6dc83h\/z\/di2o1lj), [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/8ome9s\/what_is_your_opinion_of_this_video_by_cockshott\/), and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/666u5i\/why_does_marxism_seem_to_be_so_much_more\/dikkcfs\/) or just search the subreddit.\n2. No, supply and demand still apply to modern goods (again see the [thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/qflpw6\/empirical_evidence_for_core_microeconomic_theory\/) for empirical validation of core microeconomic theory). The administrative prices argument is usually based on the idea that when you ask businesses how they set prices many will tell you they take their costs and add a profit margin on top of that. My response is that 1) businesses habitually say things that are incorrect about their own businesses (see any business arguing increased taxes or minimum wages will cause mass layoffs) and 2) as long as there's competition firms could throw darts at a board to set prices and the results would be the same as if they set prices to maximize profit (because only the most profitable firms survive)"

I kept posting in \/r\/Coinbase and I also called Coinbase 3-4 times. They fucking hung up on me everytime. The person on the phone would say something like \"hmm this is interesting, let me go talk to a specialist and put you on hold.\" Then they hung up. The only reason I got my eth in the end was because one of my comments on \/r\/Coinbase got Justin from Coinbase (forgot his username) attention. The issue was fixed after 30 minutes from him responding to me! Fucking done with Coinbase. The worst part of it was them making me hold for 1-2 hours only to get hung up on each time.

If you’re willing to share how you have accumulated your wealth, or have an opinion, I’d love to hear it.  The factors I can think of are:\n- Inherited wealth\n- Years of hard work\n- Huge amounts of stock-market-luck\n- Impressive savings plans\n\nI am new to this gig, but as a 24 year old working in the community services sector I just can’t imagine ever achieving this level of wealth.

    "answer": "Because people want a simple answer for a complex problem. Blaming Putin is the simple answer.\n\nNow as to what is really going on, in 2020 we had a global pandemic that caused a drop in the demand for oil. In response to a massive drop in demand the oil industry laid of massive number of people and idled a large number of wells. This caused a rise in the price of oil products in 2021.\n\nIn 2021 Russia started to build up troops on the Ukraine border, it was obvious to everyone that they were going to invade. This along with the drop in oil and refining production caused the large rise in oil prices in 2021. \n\nIn 2022 Russia invades Ukraine and you can see the price of oil spike again. What is also happening though is the oil industry, like every other industry, is having a labor and supply chain problem. The labor that they laid off in 2020 and 2021 is not returning in 2022. In addition it takes equipment and material to restart idle wells and that equipment and material is in short supply because of supply chain problems.\n\nNow then in addition Russian exports have received sanctions making them unavailable to sell in the countries that are issuing the sanctions. In response Russia has cut off oil and gas delivery to a number of European countries. Also the Nord Stream II pipeline that was expect to enter service delivering natural gas to Europe has not been started. \n\nIs it partially Putin's fault, yes, is partially because we are still in a pandemic and supply chains are still messed up, yes. Is it easy and politically expedient to blame it all on Biden or Putin, yes. Do people want to blame someone for a complex problem that has no solution, yes."

    "question": "I read a washington post op\/ed saying that Biden's new loan forgiveness plan is regressive and mostly helps higher earning individuals. Is that the case? If it really is a regressive policy, why does it seem that its mostly left leaning progressives that are celebrating it?",
    "answer": "The argument is about people who *after* finishing college will be well enough off that financial assistance becomes questionable.\n\nFinishing college comes with a huge earnings premium. The average college graduate earns roughly *double* in their lifetime compared to the average highschool graduate.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/policy2020\/votervital\/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.clevelandfed.org\/newsroom-and-events\/publications\/economic-commentary\/economic-commentary-archives\/2012-economic-commentaries\/ec-201210-the-college-wage-premium.aspx\n\nSo, people who attend college are on average much better off than those who don't. And of course people who don't attend college don't have student loans and therefore don't benefit from student loan forgiveness. Because of that, it's seen as a handout to at least the rich*er* part of the population.\n\nOf course that doesn't mean you can't make an argument for student loan forgiveness for the part of the population who have student loan debt and don't earn substantially more than highschool grads.\n\nAlso, there are at least some caps. People with incomes above 125k don't benefit. But then, that's still over 3x as much as the median personal income. Handing $10000 to someone who earns 100k a year is still regressive. Not to mention that it's an argument about *future* earnings as well. Maybe you're still in College, earning like 10k a year at some shitty sidegig, but if you *will* earn 100k+ a few years down the line, handing you student loan forgiveness is still regressive.\n\n&gt;If it really is a regressive policy, why does it seem that its mostly left leaning progressives that are celebrating it?\n\nBecause it's mostly politics and arguments tend to be rather dumb.\n\nBlanket student loan forgiveness is regressive. That doesn't mean that nobody is struggling or that you can't make an argument for those who could actually benefit from some help. But ultimately these discussions tend to be either slapfights or circlejerks, people aren't discussing the nuances of for which people it does and doesn't make sense."

    "question": "I am 25 years old and just started earning 18 lpa in hand. My location will be gurgaon and I think I will be able to live in 50,000 rs per month. That leaves me with 1 lakh rs to spare every month. I already have a sip of 28000 per month. I don’t want to do debt investment as I am already investing 2 LPA in epf (deducted from my ctc of 22.5 lpa). Should I stick to mutual funds or try direct stocks ?\n\n\nEdit: I am a Software Engineer from a Tier 2 college, many people are asking.",
    "answer": "Step 1: Emergency Fund: Before doing anything else, start with 6-12 months of expenses (50k x 12) and stash it away in an absolutely liquid investment - liquid meaning one that is near instantly convertible into cash - something like an FD. One additional point - this has to be separated from your regular savings account, so that you are not tempted to spend it unless it is a true emergency. \n\nThe idea of the emergency fund is to give you freedom. Let’s say your job turns crappy and you want to leave. If you are dependent on the salary, you can’t just up and leave. But if you have 12 months stashed away, you know you can take the time to breathe and search for a job that you truly like. Next, think of the power it gives you in a salary negotiation. You walk in not needing the job that instant. You are not stressed about your expenses and relying on whatever the HR of the new company throws at you. Instead, you have the ultimate power to walk away from the negotiation if you have to. Finally, it benefits you in case, god forbid, you lose your job for whatever reason. \n\nThe emergency fund is the last you draw from and first you refill. Remember, if you ever draw your emergency fund down, your first priority is to fill it back up.\n\nStep 2: now that you have an emergency fund, you can start to think of investments. First up, tax saving ones - Section 80C. Google this to know more but my suggestion here is ELSS. Maximize the annual limit of 1.5 lakh in one or more ELSS schemes to claim this tax benefit. \n\nStep 3: Now, you are getting close to investing, but you aren’t there yet. Think of massive unexpected expenses that you cannot cover out of pocket and insure against them - health insurance, life insurance, term life insurance etc. Health insurance is a must, but the others depend on your needs, and the needs of your dependents if any. \n\nStep 4: we made it to investing land! Do you fancy losing half your money tomorrow and taking 7 years to get back to the original principal while losing value to inflation? If your answer is no, and it should be, then you should diversify. Again, you are young, so you can afford to take more risk, but it should still be diversified. The exact allocation is up to you, but consider equities (stocks), bonds (corporate, government), commodities, precious metals, real estate etc. Remember to save fees wherever possible, 1% fee compounded over decades will destroy returns - ex: choose direct mutual funds instead of regular. The investments in this step are long-term, long-term meaning until retirement or next milestone (marriage - please invite only 50 people and get married on the cheap - no one cares these days and if they do, that’s on them; house, whatever other expense but at least a decade time horizon).\n\nYou check on Step 4 investments annually and adjust (rebalance) to bring the allocation back to your target allocation + change the target allocation itself to go more conservative as you age.\n\nStep 5: Some fun money! This is the fun part. What’s the new thing? Solano? NFTs? DeFi? Options trading? Something else? \n\nThis category is to satisfy your craving to be in on the action. Remember that you have stashed away a majority of your money towards long-term goals in Step 4. So this is the small amount that’s left that you are willing to lose in its entirety but also willing to take the risk to see if it pans out. \n\nStep 5 isn’t just a gimmick. Psychologically, having a small amount of your portfolio to play with for high-risk active investing makes you far less likely to touch the rest of your portfolio than if you had none at all. If you have zero allocated to this category, you become tempted to gamble (yes, most of those, regardless of what anyone says, are risky gambles) with your large savings.\n\nThat’s it my friend. Most of this stuff is on autopilot, you get to have your fun on the weekends, focus on your life and career and not worry everyday because you have a plan and you are sticking to it. \n\nGood luck to the both of us! I am 2 years older than you are 😅"

    "question": "I assume Santa uses magic to conjure up the materials needed to manufacture the various toys.  I also assume his elves work for free (maybe they get some room and board, but that too is provided via magic), and they can perform specialist tasks, like forging microchips for game systems, etc.  His reindeer also serve as a super efficient global distribution network, so he doesn't need to hire any deliverymen or procure any delivery services.  With all these presents being delivered to Christmas trees around the world without contributing anything at all to the global economy, what economic impacts can we expect?  Mass unemployment?  Commodity crashes? Deflationary pressure?  Inverted yield curves?  How bad is it going to be?",
    "answer": "Santa drives the price of toys and manufacturing labor down each Christmas. So the supply curve shifts right. Christmas however temporarily increases demand, so there are higher goods supplied at the same price point.\n\nSince Christmas has been going on for years predictably the market expects it and corrects itself in small increments, so there are no large changes to the market.\n\nAfter Christmas demand for toys goes down, and the labor supply from the elves will not be seen till the next year. This is a bit hard to track how much they are paid because it appears Santa collects payment in milk andcookies. We need more research and need to index cookie prices. Further we would need to take into account store bought vs home made, the amount of cookies supplied per household, and type of cookie."

    "answer": "GameStop is a thesis. It is a hypothesis that financial players on wallstreet have been committing crimes for decades and in doing so they are robbing the general public. A certain individual on reddit noticed that this stock had more shares shorted than were ever issued. A following was started. In January of 2021, the thesis was all but \"proved\" when we saw the price squeeze from a few dollars to over 500$ in less than a couple of days. The thesis was all but proved!! Since that time, there is enough evidence to show that the amount of shares sold short are even greater than last January. The new thesis since that time is that crimes were committed by shutting off the buying of this stock but the financial powers that be, rather than taking their loss, decided to double down. Increasing their short position and opening themselves up to an infinite loss of money. \n\nYou friend is playing the odds. He is not looking at this as an investment based on earnings, PE ratios, etc...He is looking at it as once in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of an infinite gain of money. January 2021 cannot be denied. It happened and we all saw the industry shut retail out from unimaginable gains. THey didnt do this because they were sour. They did it because if they hadn't they would have incurred infinite losses. We already know this to be true. Major Wallstreet execs have admitted to this. We were there as it happened. \n\nIn the end, any individual NOT holding GME is making the mistake. There has never been a greater opportunity to be a part of an infinite money glitch than there is now. Everyone holding GME is aware that this may not play out exactly as they want. They are all prepared to lose. If your friend made as much money as I did back in Jan...then he is playing with house money so it's even better. \n\nOne thing is for sure...if you think we are all nuts. Fine!

    "question": "i.e. What have economists discovered in the last 50 years?\n\nA lot has happened since the 1970s, like the two oil shocks, US stagflation, fall of the Soviet Union, 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nHas economics undergone any fundamental shifts over this period of time? Has there been any breakthroughs or major shifts of thought?",
    "answer": "Probably the biggest advancements in economics over that time period would be developments in computation which have allowed for development of more advanced data methods. Economic data is very plentiful in the 21st century and new methods emerging to leverage that data have also followed suit and resulted in their own developments. The growth of the industrial optimization field is a good example of how both data and method have evolved with computational ability to expand knowledge of industrial methods.\n\nAnother major growth area has been behavioral economics. A lot of new research in this field has emerged since the 1990s and especially in the 21st century, and although doesn't originate in the past 50 years (some behavioral economics can be found as earlier as Adam Smith), much of the current literature is based on findings that have only emerged in the last 30 or so years.\n\nFinally, changes to the structure of the global economy, especially the end of the Bretton-Woods system in the early 1970s, has resulted in all sorts of advancements and modernization in finance and currency. Financial markets look nothing like they did 50 years ago, and floating exchange rates have also resulted in a bunch of emergent areas of study as well (exchange rate pass through, currency markets and arbitrage, etc.). For the most part though, computation may arguably one of the biggest contributors to facilitating modern advancements as far as I'm aware."

    "question": "Honest question.\n\nWhere is all the money?  I hear nothing but bad news about financial crisis all over the world, and it seems that there is a shortage of cash - like it is some sort of natural resource.\n\nPeople haven't stopped buying stuff.  They still need food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Taxes are still collected. Fines are still levied. \n\nSo where is all the money?  I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \n\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?",
    "answer": "Here's some way of thinking about it, and I'm not really sure if it's completely correct, but sometimes we oversimplify when trying to tell a five year old :)\n\nSay there are two people in the world. You and me. We both have $100. A total of $200 in the world.\n\nSuddenly, a wild bank appears. I deposit my $100 in the bank. I still have $100 and you still have $100. Now you want to buy something from me that costs $150. You go to the bank to loan money. The bank has $100 available so gives you $50. You give me $150. Now I have $250 and you are $50 in debt. I deposit the $150 in the bank.\n\nWe do this again and again, until I have $1000 on my bank account, and you are $900 in debt. I want to buy a house of $500 and go to my bank, demanding to take out $500. But there is only $200 in the whole world so the bank can only give me $200.\n\n\"Money\" has been created out of thin air, but it's actually you who are in debt. If you go bankrupt, the bank has a big debt it won't get back, and is in deep shit when I come around to demand my money back. At that point governments step in to loan the bank money for cheap, because if the bank fails, I will lose all my pension savings I put into that bank, as well as my companies and a lot of my employees.\n\nAnd other banks loaned this bank money, so if this bank fails, the other banks will be in the exact same position and will also fail, because then they will also have debts that won't be paid back.\n\nThere are regulations minimizing this - i.e. a bank is required to keep a percentage of the amount of money on its accounts, so there's a maximum limit of \"money created\".\n\n"

    "question": "I hang with you guys, not the YOLO's at r\/WSB, but I'm reading tonight and they're all convinced that the crazy run on GME is just starting (they're also high on BB).\n\nMaybe I'm just feeling a little FOMO, but I have some FU money and thinking about throwing some money at GME and BB next week just for the rush. Anyone else thinking about it?",
    "answer": "What is going on: there are more shares of GME shorted than actually exist. That means that if the stock goes up for *any* reason, short sellers come under pressure to buy shares to close their short positions. But when the first short seller cracks and buys shares (taking a loss) they inadvertently drive the price up further, adding to the pressure on the other short sellers. Soon it’s a race to buy shares, but there simply aren’t enough to go around, so the price skyrockets before falling back down as shareholders finally take profits and sell. This is called a “short squeeze”. The only way a short squeeze is averted is if the stock price drops for some reason (like bad news from the company). GME is at ATH right now so it’s very unlikely that the short sellers will get out alive. It’s a matter of *when* they start to crack, not *if*. By all accounts they haven’t cracked yet, so the short squeeze hasn’t actually started.\n\nWhat happened Friday was a “gamma squeeze”, which is unrelated to a short squeeze, but happens when call options are being bought extremely fast and the stock price is rising, which indirectly causes market makers to buy massive volumes of shares to hedge, driving the price higher, and so on.\n\nThe high probability of a massive short squeeze caused retail traders to plow money into shares and calls on Friday, which in then caused a gamma squeeze, causing the stock price to go higher, making the short squeeze even *more* likely.\n\nIf you have gambling money and you want to take part in this unique event, you either buy shares or call options. Shares are safer (since no matter when the squeeze occurs, you’re ready, while calls expire) but calls give you leverage. Calls, even far OTM and short expiry calls, are likely to be very expensive. Everybody knows this is going down, it’s been covered on major news, and retail money is flooding in as people try to get onboard before the shorts crack.\n\nEdit: either pony up for gold so I don’t have to look at ads or save your money for GME shares Monday morning"

I sold my BTC at $50k. I could’ve bought in sooner and I could’ve held longer, but I DOUBLED MY INVESTMENT in a very short period of time. That’s the DREAM in most investments.\n\nThink about a traditional investment. If you make 20% in a year on a stock, that’s a really amazing stock. Take your profits and move on. Don’t agonize over how much you could’ve made with a different decision.\n\nI think it’s because with cryptos, people are investing very small amounts. $50-$100 at a time and expecting $1000 or more in profit.

    "answer": "To summarize, the money never existed. The best example I can give is the housing bubble. Houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money. When people couldn't make their payments, the house prices crashed.\n\nThe boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended (boom) and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes (bust).\n\nThe real question that people should be asking is not \"Where did all the money go?\", but \"Why is money issued by private banks?\"\n\nMoney is a social invention to facilitate trade. Should it not be like a public water utility? Counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it. Money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized. All natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters, joules, degrees, etc. Money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest. We essentially pay rent on all money that isssued and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created, once again at interest. This is why economists generally say some inflation is good. Finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality, money is just an IOU that requires no such interest payment for it's issue.\n\nInterest should be made if a loan is issued against savings, but not for the simple issuance of money. There should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment. You can read more about this from reading about Arthur Kitson. In this way, the public controls the value of it's money, not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class.\n\nIf you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt, read the work of Frederick Soddy. It's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least. Wealth is subject to the laws of thermodynamics while debt is an invention of the human will. Debt never rots or degrades with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest - nothing in the natural world does this."

    "question": "When I (27M) was growing up my father made about 100k\/ year working in a mine. He had multiple houses big boats. I have always tried to follow in his footsteps by always being the hardest working, and taking hard jobs most won’t do that will pay more but it isn’t enough. Now people are getting wealthy from the easiest jobs like sitting on your computer or whatever. I would really appreciate some advice because I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. I have had a family for a couple years and we are barely getting by. I make 26 an hour right now but with inflation I had to get sent money for gas  just to get to work today. I have been full time at my job for 2 years. I try to budget and I can’t remember the last time I actually got myself anything. I feel like a failure to my family and I’m doing the best I can. I need to learn modern ways of making money, this is not how I want to spend my life. \n\nTLDR: old ways of making money are dead please show me the way.",
    "answer": "Go to indeed and search remote jobs. If you don't know where to start search for customer service. Pay is 20+ per hour and you can work from your living room.

I get the feeling that some of these people feel this market rally will never come to an end. Suddenly a portfolio that is not heavy with US tech or speculative small caps is suddenly a \"boomer\" portfolio. I get enough US tech exposure through my s&amp;p500 etf. I dont believe getting greedy or going \"all in\" on high risk bets is a sustainable investing strategy. \n\nCall me old fashioned but I still think a globally diversified portfolio is the best way to get stable, &amp; sustainable returns.",
    "answer": "The problem is growth vs maintance. When you don't have a lot of capital, growing the capital is primarily the goal. When you have a lot of capital, maintaining it in steady increments is the goal.\n\nIf I have 1000$. There isn't much incentive to get that 5% a year increase. Rather I would want to increase it at a higher rate with riskier trades.\n\nHowever, if I have 50,000$. That 5% a year + dividend off blue chips makes sure that I not only have peace of mind knowing it's secure, but that steady increment is paying off in a big way.\n\nSo a lot of new investors don't see the value of etf\/blue chips because they don't have a lot of capital."

    "answer": "Typically what people do here is start with a capital allocation plan where they split up their money putting more of it into lower risk investments and smaller sums into higher risk ones.  How much to put in each \"basket\" of risk depends on the individual but usually it'd be something like 300k into a low risk stable longer term return. 100K into a slightly more aggressive mid term sort of investment and then 50K (maybe split over 5\\* 10K) high risk sort of investments that can either lose or hit you home runs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea here is you exposure yourself to a lot of potential upside if things run well for you but limit the amount of downside since most of your money is in lower risk investments.  If you do not have a lot of experience with investing you're going to want to spend a decent amount of time and effort into researching your lower risk\/higher capital investments."

    "question": " Warren Buffett, once, advised a bunch of youngsters, to get a punch card with only 20 spots in it. That’s the number of stocks they’re allowed to buy in their lifetime, he told them. Imagine how careful they would be if they could only buy 20 companies in their entire life of 80 or 100 years. Compare that to what many retail investors do nowadays. They treat their investments like a Playstation game. They think that they need to always act. If they don’t act, they lose the game, they assume. The fact of the matter is investing **isn’t a game**. It isn’t easy. If it was, most people would win. In reality, though, the majority of investors actually lose. Some estimate that 90% of investors lose. The problem is, most investors believe they are among the 10% that win!",

    "question": "People, when you post your success, please throw some bones in here for the rest of us. Too often I read people creating \"throw away\" accounts to humble brag their success and retire early, etc. PLEASE remember there is a super majority of us here who are still grinding the day to day - making ends meet. When you post your wins, congrats, but post some details on how you got there. Why did you choose your method vs others. I wanna read your thought logic, not just how much NW you have and what you started with. Help us connect the dots. Lift others up, not bring other down. This is not Instagram.\n\nEdit: \"making ends meet\" meaning trying to hit my investments, earnings and savings targets (not always easy). Some folks are saying I don't belong here, so I want to clarify that I'm currently on the FatFIRE track, but would like to learn more from others - especially those who made it.",
    "answer": "Yeah.... no. I don’t make threads like that but I don’t support this. \n\n\nI’m happy for others. Simply seeing their success is both motivating and fun for me to read. If they want to boast about their new house? Their new car? That’s awesome, congrats to them and seriously love reading it. \n\n\nI don’t require them to tell me anything “for me” because I’m still grinding to get there. \n\n\nFor anyone here who’s made it? Sure give us details if you want. If you simply want to share your success and explain what it’s like? That’s awesome and motivating to me. I won’t get bitter at all and sometimes simply hearing your happiness with a result is good enough for me.\n\n\nEdit: one more thing, a pet peeve of mine is when somebody calls it bragging when a person worked so hard to earn something and wants to share it with this group, anonymously online. That’s not bragging and they earned every right to be proud of it and show us. We often can’t share cool things with real life friends. Let’s avoiding telling those people they’re bragging, I don’t think they are."

I mean I have to manage spending of course, but I'm not in trouble or anything, and seem to be able to use advice here as well. But I'm just wondering: is this mainly a sub for the more wealthy?",

At least my personal interest with financial and FIRE subs grew as my income grew.\n\nThat saying 30k in my part of EU is a decent wage, maybe even on the higher side.

    "question": "I can understand how other people touted as \"wealthiest person in the world\" got their wealth, for example:\n\n* Bill Gates gained his wealth because his Windows operating system is the dominant computer operating system\n* Jeff Bezos gained his wealth because his e-commerce business is widely used worldwide\n* Sergey Brin and Larry Page gained their wealth through creating the world's dominant search engine and web browser\n* Vladimir Putin gained his wealth through corruption at the head of a massive and resource-rich nation\n\nIn contrast:\n\n* SpaceX products and services are not as widely used as those of Microsoft, Amazon or Google\n* Tesla comprises less than 1% of the market share of automobiles worldwide\n* Elon Musk's other promises such as Hyperloop have been nothing but hot air",
    "answer": "The vast majority of Elon Musk's net worth come from Tesla, so let's ignore the other things for now. \n\nTesla is currently the most valuable asset cat company in the world. In fact, it's worth more than the next 5 biggest combined. So it's easy to see how a major owner and leader of the by far most valuable car company in the world could have a high net worth. \n\nRemember those wealth number just list net worth. They are not just counting his cash in the bank. It's highly unlikely he could sell all his stock and realise that kind of money without the stock tanking.\n\nNow, from the way you've phrased your question or sounds like you doubt the value of Tesla. You may be right of course, and if you are his net worth will go down as others figure it out. However the reason a lot of people value it so highly goes something like this:\nA companies value is not determined by what its doing right now. If I had a dollar but knew it was about to turn into $100, I wouldn't sell it for a dollar. I wouldn't even sell it for $50, I'd probably value it at very close to $100. So people are looking at Tesla and trying to work out what it will turn into over the next decades. \nThey only sold a bit over 1% of new cars, but they certainly didn't sell them at the average price. These are expensive cars globally.\n\nNow we get to electric cars. A lot of people think there won't be many petrol cars sold in 10 to 20 years. Tesla sold double as many electric cars than its next competitor in 2021. So the bet is, is it easier for existing auto makers to switch their factories to electric cars? Or is it easier for Tesla to build new factories? If it is easier for existing car manufacturers to convert factories, how did Tesla get such a huge lead inf the first place?\n\nNow everything I've said about Tesla has little to do with economics and could be all wrong. But the stock is valued that high because there are people who believe it, and demonstrate that with their wallet by buying a piece of the company for what they think the company will be worth. Elon Musks net worth is calculated based on the amount investors show they believe the company is worth by buying shares, divide by the portion he owns.\n\nRemember Bill Gates didn't become a billionaire in the current era. He did it in the 80s. Only about 5 million PC's were sold that year. He was a billionaire long before his Microsoft was ubiquitous in every household. \n\nAnd so Elon Musk has a high net worth before his companies either have an impact commensurate with their valuations, or decline with his net worth to follow."

This is almost a philosophical question.. same can be asked in the context of a tech startup. And the answer is, startups sometimes look where big companies dont, or they actually have an edge! (say a proprietary IP)",
    "answer": "Yes. In fact, there are many advantages to being a (automated) retail investor\/trader. I won't distinguish automation as an advantage or disadvantage because it is simply a tool for executing strategies and not a strategy within itself. \n\nFirst and foremost, small trades (I mean &lt;$100k or so, assuming a liquid enough asset) do not really move markets, allowing your positions to effectively realize the full intended movement at the time of entering the trade. Second, and perhaps more importantly, retail order flow is considered \"non-toxic\" and often allows you to get better fills. That's right - market makers DO NOT want to trade against sophisticated institutions and will actively try to avoid their orders. However, retail order flow is literally just considered noise (as for the most part, it is), so market makers love to trade on it (think Robinhood). No matter how sophisticated your strategies might be, your trades will be considered retail and gobbled up by market makers, providing you with better fills. \n\nThe markets are so complex and there are so many opportunities for everyone involved. To think that \"I can't do this because someone bigger and smarter already does\" is defeatist and incorrect. Good strategies make money; bad ones don't - simple as that."

    "question": "I hear lots of people calling for a boycott on companies like Nestle or Apple, because those companies are often tied to child labor and inhumane working conditions in foreign countries. And obviously child labor and sweatshops are despicable, but I’ve always wondered: if these boycotts became widespread enough to start affecting the company, would they actually start treating their employees better? Or would they just like, fire them all? Do boycotts help improve the conditions of mistreated workers, or do they just lead to them being unemployed and even poorer?\n\n(This is probably the dumbest and most ignorant question ever, but I don’t take AP Macro til next year and I kinda don’t know a lot about the global supply chain)",
    "answer": "Far from being dumb or ignorant, it is indeed a very intelligent and legitimate question . Here is an excerpt from a paper that investigates this issue: \n\n\"A common perception is that most child laborers work for wages in the formal sector, conjuring images of children working long hours in sweatshops or toiling away in mines. As a result, consumer boycotts and trade sanctions against products using child labor as an input are often discussed as means of reducing the incidence of child labor. In reality, however, such methods may have little impact for several reasons. Firstly, nearly 70 percent of working children are active in the agricultural sector, rather than manufacturing (ILO, 2006). Secondly, very few children work for wages outside the home; rather, most children are employed by their parents on the family farm or enterprise (Edmonds and Pavcnik, 2005). As a result, the majority of child laborers will not be affected by boycotts and trading sanctions. Further, children working in the affected sectors may simply relocate to an unaffected sector. Similarly, an outright ban on child labor would in most cases be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce and as such would likely to have little effect on the overall incidence of child labor. In the worst case, a ban could end up making some children significantly worse off if these children are compelled to work in order to keep themselves and their families out of extreme poverty. This is not to say that bans are never motivated; clearly a ban on illegal and hazardous activities is desirable. However, additional policy instruments are necessary in order to effectively combat child labor.\"\n\n[https:\/\/gupea.ub.gu.se\/bitstream\/2077\/18369\/1\/gupea\\_2077\\_18369\\_1.pdf](https:\/\/gupea.ub.gu.se\/bitstream\/2077\/18369\/1\/gupea_2077_18369_1.pdf)"

    "question": "This is driving me crazy just from confusion. In like 90% of books and sources I read, experts say rent control creates scarcity, it does the opposite of its desired effect essentially. I’ve seen that when rent control was put into place in various cities it immediately lead to less housing development. I’ve seen that it causes landlords to not care about upkeep, it causes abandoned buildings occasionally cause they weren’t profitable, and I read it can lead to construction of more luxury buildings where rent control doesn’t apply. In that last case it seems like this system that tries to help the poor in fact helps the rich. Yet I still see politicians advocating for it and it still exists in places around the world. What the hell am I missing? People don’t seem that upset over this and I don’t get it lol.",
    "answer": "See my username.\n\nIt is bad for society, bad for new\/future residents, bad for a city as a whole.  That's basically the economic story, but I don't think you are asking why it is bad.\n\nSo why do we have it?\n\nBecause it is great for for current renters and current renters vote.  They outnumber landlords (many landlords probably don't even live in the same local political zone as their properties) and are easily moved by self-interest.  Nobody likes paying rent, so it is really easy to vote for a candidate who is going to keep yours down.\n\nWhy does it continue in places where it is having a clear adverse effect?\n\nSame reason basically.  The local tenants control who gets elected.  Any long time resident is heavily benefiting from rent control so they want to to stick around.  The people who are harmed most, such as those who can't find an apartment, don't live there and don't vote in the district.  \n\nSecond answer is just that a lot of people don't understand.  They see super high rents in non-rent controlled units and see it as evidence that rent control works.  Instead of blaming the rent controlled units for the problem, they get jealous and wish they had one themselves... They aren't going to vote against the thing they aspire to eventually have!\n\nBut mainly I think the story is that in most places with rent control, renters control the politicians who wrote the laws rebuilding rent.  They vote their own self interest and the politicians follow.\n\nedit: last night after posting this I listened to the rebroadcast [Freakonomics podcast about rent control](https:\/\/freakonomics.com\/podcast\/rent-control-rebroadcast\/).

However, hiring would probably be more arduous and structural unemployment would likely go up significantly because of the associated bureaucracy (voting on each new employee) and cost (every current employee’s equity and share of profits being diluted) of hiring.   \n\nTo clear something up, worker ownership is socialism at a systematic level. If all companies were owned by employees, this would be considered market socialism and\/or socialism because the means of production would be owned by the workers\/employees."

I hope he spends time pumping and dumping other crap and not focus on ETH as the ravings of a power mad billionaire are hardly a strong foundation for long term success.\n\nOne of the attractions of crypto was that it was supposedly going to empower the weak and instead it’s turned into another plaything for the rich and super rich.",
    "answer": "I think it was always a little naive to assume that crypto was going to completely reverse the class system. Of course crypto is going to allow some rich people to stay rich, the point is that it will provide (and has already provided) many low income people with an opportunity to gain life changing wealth. A world running on cryptocurrencies still won't be perfect, but it will be infinitely fairer than a world running on centralised money that can literally be printed out of thin air by a small group of elites."

    "question": "Me and my husband are both EU citizens. We moved to Canada a few years ago, but are thinking of moving again. We are considering a move to an EU country. \n\nWe are both I.T professionals, and are hoping it wouldn't be too difficult to find a job in this industry. We earn good income in Toronto, but are considering moving due to a few reasons (high income earners are heavily taxed, winters are brutal, only 15 yearly vacation days, buying property is expensive, Canadian dollar value is weak). \n\nWhere would you suggest moving to for the best quality of life and financial stability? We have considered The Netherlands and Portugal - but are open to moving to any country. \n\n(We are English-speaking, any country you would suggest avoiding due to language barriers having an impact on quality of life?)",

    "question": "So I ran the numbers and in Canada you can make 120k on an investment portfolio with an effective tax rate of 4%.\n\nOn the other hand, if you made the same amount as a worker, your effective tax rate is 30%… an almost 7.5x increase or 750%!\n\nWhat’s the reason?\n\nI get it’s to “stimulate investment” or whatever, but does that really justify the steep discrepancy?\n\nWhy not bring it closer together somewhat?\n\nLower the effective rate of the average worker and increase the rate of investors(?)\n\nThoughts?",
    "answer": "There is a theoretical literature that studies the optimal way to fund government spending.\n\nIn the simplest optimal taxation models, you want to tax labor instead of capital. In those models, the optimal tax on capital is zero. \n\nThe reason is that most forms of taxation distort equilibrium prices and this creates inefficiencies. Capital taxes create more inefficiencies because of the dynamic nature of savings and capital. \n\nIn reality life, the story is much more complicated than in those models and there are reasons to tax capital. But the intuition of the model persists. Taxing capital generates  inter-temporal distortions that you want to avoid.\n\nOne important thing to take into account is that capital is different from wealth. This is a distinction that wasn’t made in the past. The idea of taxing wealth has picked up a lot of interest lately.\n\nHere is a recent paper (I think it is forthcoming in QJE) that discusses these ideas and, in particular, it explains when you would like to tax wealth \n\nhttps:\/\/fatihguvenen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/GKKO-THEORY-2022-WEB.pdf"

    "question": "Just curious. I keep hearing things from 6 months to 10+ years. Just wanted to hear what people here thought.\n\nThis is with real money (no paper trading.)\n\nAlso any tips\/advice would be appreciated.",
    "answer": "I've been trading since 1996'ish.  In that time I've traded just about every type of market condition there is.  Made a ton of money during the internet boom because all you had to do was trade a .com name and made a fortune.  I was on top of the world, king of the castle, the head honcho... then came the internet crash and I lost every damn penny chasing the dragon, and then some.  \n\nUnfortunately, I'm seeing a very similar mindset now as I did during the internet boom.  Everyone thinks they can make money and everyone is an expert.  Well, I'm not here to tell you not to chase your dreams and give it a shot, heck, I love the added volatility\/liquidity, just try not to do it with money you aren't prepared to lose (I'm speaking from firsthand experience here).\n\nTo answer your question, it took me about 7 years to become a decent profitable trader and about 15 years to become a damn good one. Don't get me wrong, I was profitable for most of those first 7 years (minus the internet bust blowup) but my personal volatility was off the charts.\n\nMy advice is to keep it simple.  Don't get caught up in trading all sorts of different vehicles, pick one, and learn it like the back of your hand.  Become the master of that one thing.  Then just grind it out.  All I trade is the \/YM now.  That's it, nothing else.  (I also manage my own investments but that's not trading).\n\nNext, don't trade just to trade, only trade when the setup is proper.  Patience is definitely the key here.  Don't rush into trades, don't trade just because you haven't done so in a while, don't force anything.  There have been weeks where I don't place a single trade.  \n\nFinally, learn when to sell losers.  It's more important (by a little) than knowing when to sell for a gain.  Cut your losses and you can live to play again tomorrow.\n\nGL"

    "question": "They say if you ask a poor person for money advice is poor and with rich it's rich. So I have been asking advice of people who have become financially independent, at least money isn't a stressing factor in their lives.\n\nOh my god. \"Save 20% of income and invest it.\" I explain money is tight and hardly any left to buy a single stock. \"Oh then ask for a raise or job hop.\" OK, my review is 6 months away, and in the Mean time what else? \"A side Hustle! Whatever you make there invest it!\" Tried and got burned out, actually made me work less from exhaustion. \n\nSo I asked \"what did YOU do?\" And the story is what you expext; my parents paid for college, I got into tech, my dad knew someone in the company, etc.\n\nThey are giving me advice they didn't follow through with. They could have just said \"I don't have any experience with that, I grew up in privilege.\"",
    "answer": "At this point becoming financially independent requires a high salary, very low expenses, very good savings habits or a combination of two of the three. You’re asking people what they did to get there and saving AT LEAST 20% of their income, having side hustles, job hopping are all common things that actually work. When you are truly in poverty and are working lower wage jobs then  these things are just not possible so it’s hard to relate to that advice."

I think it has a limited impact, but given that this is a recent phenomenon and the zoning measures mostly aren't, I highly doubt this is the whole story*. In the 80s Japanese housing had insane price runs despite the zoning laws being quite similar.

    "question": "What are some major questions that the most respected economists are working on today? Is there any issue that has two \"evenly matched\" sides and no true consensus yet?",
    "answer": "Economics is a huge field with a *lot* of topics being researched. Just a select few off the top of my head:\n\n- In the macro world, why are interest rates so low (not just today, but even pre-COVID)? There are a [number of competing theories](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/s4zs7s\/why_are_longterm_interest_rates_so_low_is_larry\/hsus29m\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3), with the main ones being global savings glut, secular stagnation, and a shift towards less risky assets (this is explored in more detail in the link).\n- In labor economics, the effects of minimum wage on employment is still frequently researched. The [FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_minwage\/) covers the topic well. Research has revealed that minimum wages don’t always lead to large employment losses, so most research today is focused on the question of at what level (or under what conditions) minimum wages could become more problematic.\n- In developmental economics, there is lots of cool research going on trying to answer the question of “how do we make very poor people better off?” I highly suggest “Poor Economics” by Banerjee &amp; Duflo (2019 Nobel laureates) as a non-technical read on the subject. It remains my favourite non-technical econ book.\n- Climate economics is a very active field. We’re still learning about the many inter-connected ways that climate change will impact the world, and thus the economy."

    "question": "According to Wikipedia, the United States has the seventh highest nominal GDP per capita in the world and the eighth highest PPP GDP per capita. And most of the countries ranked higher than it are very small and generate their money through oil (Norway, Qatar) or banking (Switzerland). Also according to Wikipedia, the US has the highest median household income. \n\nSo what explains this? Why is America so rich, even compared to other developed countries?",
    "answer": "This question is too broad to provide a definitive answer to. \"Why are some countries richer than others?\" is *the* fundamental question in the field of macroeconomic growth and development. Getting a comprehensive answer would require taking a semester long course on growth and development (at the very least).\n\nWe know a little bit more about what are typically called \"proximate\" causes (for a general framework, see [here](http:\/\/klenow.com\/DevelopmentAccounting.pdf)). This answers the question of how the US makes more stuff than (say) France, in a literal physical sense. The short answer here is that generally speaking about 10-30 percent of the difference is explained by education and skill differences (\"human capital\"), 20 percent is explain by more and better machines (\"physical capital\"), and 50-70 percent is explained by \"total factor productivity\" (TFP), which is basically a term meaning \"everything else that is harder to measure\/quantify\".\n\nGiven its large role in explaining income differences, the last few decades of growth research has mostly involved trying to break down TFP and determine\/quantify its various components. I will defer to the previously linked paper if you want further discussion of this.\n\nBut this leaves open the question: why was it the US, in particular, that ended up with high human capital, physical capital, and TFP? Why not Argentina or some other country? These are effectively the first sets of arrows in the framework I linked.\n\nThis is a much broader and more open question without a conclusive answer. The answer seems be to lots of little things from history (WWII, colonialism, etc) to geography to culture to simple randomness. I'm unaware of the solid lit review covering all of this, and it's beyond the scope of this post. The gist is: there's a lot here that we don't really know and this bit in particular is still an active area of research.\n\nAnyways, that's my quick summary. There is also a cheap answer to your question that I have saved for the end (because apparently I wanted to write a post about development accounting). This is that the US simply works more hours than many of these countries which lets them make more income. If you look at [output per hour worked](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/labor-productivity-per-hour-pennworldtable?tab=table), the US is still near the top but it isn't a crazy outlier."

    "question": "So I wrote an intermediate microeconomics exam in university back in like, 2009.  One of the questions on the exam was so absurd that I am about 25% sure it was actually a fever dream.\n\nThe gist was as follows:\n\nYou are sitting at a bar. You start chatting with the girl next to you, and really hit it off. Then suddenly, she has to leave. You were not able to get her name or number before she left. You want to see this person again. Using microeconomic theory, discuss how you can make this happen.\n\n\n\nI remember writing this huge paragraph about \"you need to go back to the same bar tomorrow at the same time\"\n\nBut goddammit reddit, it is 11 years later, I have a degree in economics, and I still don't know how I could have used economic theory to answer this.",
    "answer": "Use [revealed preference](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Revealed_preference#The_Weak_Axiom_of_Revealed_Preference_(WARP). She has some utility function\n\nU(bar, x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)\n\nthat may be time-dependent as well. What matters is that she chose to attend that bar at that time, as opposed to other options.\n\nThe key is that we don't know how her constraints played into her decision to attend at the time. Hence, while going to the bar at the same time might be smart, you need to do more to ensure that deciding to go to the bar again is [individually rational](https:\/\/www.econlib.org\/book-chapters\/chapter-ch-4-individual-rationality-in-social-choice\/) for her. \n\nSo, you make a deal with the bar owner\/bartender to make a drink cheaper, or something that that reduces her cost of attendance. \"But it'll be very expensive if I have to strike a deal!\" Then you write out your intertemporal utility maximization problem, where your goal is to (potentially) marry this lady, but in the short run you'd have to pay the cost of the deal with the bartender (Note that the goal is probably to just meet this lady and get to know her more, with the possibility than you go on to want to marry her, but that depends on signals and whatnot; since it's an exam I think this can be mentioned in a line, while you just simplify the goal to marriage, due to limited time). I'd recommend writing search theory [Bellman equation(s)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dynamic_programming) for this portion, and characterizing the reservation cost of a deal you strike with the bartender using standard assumptions on utility\/production functions, i.e. the cost that makes you indifferent between a deal and no deal. See how you can apply the [Slutsky equation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slutsky_equation) to her decision-making process.\n\nThese parts can be answered in maybe 2\/3 a page of writing\/equations with normal-sized handwriting, which I think is reasonable for an exam question.\n\nIf you have time remaining, I'd definitely go into complements and substitutes. The day of the week matters here. My prior is that going to the bar on a Friday night is complementary to going to the bar next Friday night, but is a substitute for going to the bar on Saturday night. Going to the bar on, say, a Monday night is probably not a complement with anything, as the impression I have is that people unfortunately tend to do that when going through a rough time. But I don't drink, so I wouldn't know.\n\n*Note: this question is open-ended and most likely will accept multiple answers. It probably wants to test your economic reasoning.*\n\nEdit: I mixed up individual rationality with incentive compatibility at first."

    "question": "The most popular saying of all time. I've come here to see if it's true.\n\n.”The wealth gap between upper-income and lower- and middle-income families has grown wider this century.

    "answer": "The share of wealth of the top 1% and top 10% has been relatively stable over the last two centuries.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/319227140\/figure\/fig2\/AS:669671804117000@1536673608298\/Figure-no-1-Wealth-inequality-Europe-and-the-US-1810-2010.png\n\nAnd up until recently, the real wealth of the bottom 90% has grown quite steadily.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/static\/sys-images\/Guardian\/Pix\/pictures\/2014\/11\/11\/1415705163748\/7200feb5-69a6-43f2-a5ee-9f7251941be4-bestSizeAvailable.png?width=1920&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=57369e63eaa177bb49e9cab4c3391f68\n\nSo no, there is no general trend of the poor getting poorer. The rich get richer and the poor also get richer. The poor just haven't been able to recover from the last recession.\n\nThat said, I'm not necessarily comfortable with using household data since household wealth might also be driven by household composition.\n\nPeople get richer the older they get, simply by virtue of having more time to accumulate wealth and earning more money later in their careers, so if people for example marry later in their lives now, their households, and their household wealth, is smaller for longer periods in their lives.\n\nSadly I can't seem to find much data on individual wealth."

{
    "question": "What do economists think of models of socialism where the means of production are owned by the workers, not the state, operating through a mixed market? Is such a thing even feasible?",
    "answer": "The problem with this approach is that it creates a mismatch between supply of and and demand for capital. Different industries have wildly different capital to labor ratios, so you end up with situations where, e.g., landscapers own very little capital while factory workers own huge amounts of capital, despite these jobs having similar skill requirements.\n\nHow does that happen? It's not hard to buy landscaping tools, but how does a worker fresh out of high school get the cash to buy a share of a factory so he can work there?\n\nMaybe the factory worker doesn't have to buy in, but gets shares of the factory in addition to a salary. So he must get paid a lot less than the landscaper. But that's okay, since he has savings in the form of factory shares which I guess he'll sell to new workers when he retires. Unless the factory goes bust. Then he's kind of screwed. Investing your life's savings in one business isn't a great idea. Also, if the factory goes through a rough spell and loses money for several years, how do workers get paid?\n\nMeanwhile, the landscaper is living large on pure cash compensation. He's making so much money that he decides to save some and invest it in...what, exactly? There's no stock market because the means of production are all owned by the workers. Some market socialists allow the issuing of bonds, although it's never really been clear to me why buying a portion of future EBITDA via lending is kosher while doing so via equity is not. So there's an option, maybe.\n\nElsewhere, a group of young geniuses have a great idea and want to start a business. Let's say that after five years it has a 90% chance of failure and a 10% chance of making $10 billion. They need $5 million dollars to pay their business and living expenses for the next 5 years. They do not have this money. Lending is not a good way to fund this because of the high risk of failure. Equity investment would be ideal for this situation, but that's not allowed, because workers have to own the means of production. So they just go to work at existing companies.\n\nTo summarize, a non-exhaustive list of the problems:\n\n1. People who have cash to invest and people who need capital to do their jobs are often not the same people. This is an especially big problem for forming new firms, since bootstrapping is infeasible in industries that require large up-front investments.\n\n2. Workers who save money benefit from the ability to diversify their investments. Investing exclusively in the company where you work is a really bad idea.\n\n3. Often less-skilled workers simply are not productive enough that they can afford to take a large share of their total compensation in the form of shares.\n\nWe have capital markets in order to allocate capital efficiently and mitigate risk. When you don't allow the roles of worker and investor to be played by different people, that doesn't happen.\n\nFurthermore, workers who want to own the means of production can do that right now. All we have to do is set aside some of our pay to invest in the stock market. Preferably in an index fund instead of just one company."

Good agents are the ones who realize they dont know shit and actually put some effort into it. Truly the 1%"

    "question": "Since billionares have so much money that is not being used to move the economy sunce its not being used at all, isn't this bad for the economy in a capitalist country?",
    "answer": "Your question assumes that billionaires’ wealth is mostly made up of cash. But it’s the opposite actually, they typically owns assets that are worth billions in the open market today.\n\nIn essence what that means is they bought\/invested in those assets with some cash at some point. And the recipients of that cash (typically some company), deployed that cash in a value creating manner for the public i.e. they provided goods and services that generate profits. The goods and services generate profits because the customers value them and are willing to spend money on it. In addition they generate profits because the company created the goods and services efficiently, in other words it costs them less to create than what customers are willing to pay. \n\nSo billionaires cash is actually being put to work in the market, and this is actually the essence of capitalism. Letting people choose where they want to spend their money, and in return giving them ownership of what they buy. In fact, this works the same whether you’re a billionaire or not. For most people with any retirement account, they don’t actually have much cash. They’ve given their cash to someone else (usually another investor) who uses that cash however they want. This is all overly simplified but it’s meant to address your assumption and explain how the money is being used."

    "question": "Hi, I am from India. I am totally new in Economics (have just started studying high school Economics). Recently I came across an article from Economic Times that says America owes India more than a hundred billion dollars. \n\nSource: [https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/economy\/indicators\/us-owes-india-usd-216-billion-as-american-debt-soars-to-usd-29-trillion-lawmaker\/articleshow\/81240956.cms?from=mdr](https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/news\/economy\/indicators\/us-owes-india-usd-216-billion-as-american-debt-soars-to-usd-29-trillion-lawmaker\/articleshow\/81240956.cms?from=mdr)\n\nThis is a huge surprise to me as all my life I have heard that my country is economically poorer and weak and it survives only by borrowing money from western countries. Why would a superpower and rich country like USA need to borrow anything from a much poorer country like India? How does this work? Why is USA borrowing that money and what for?",
    "answer": "Nations borrow by issuing bonds. They sells bonds at auctions. The bond then pays a payment over some number of years, that's called the coupon. At the end the principle is paid back.\n\nSo, you could buy a bond with a face value of $100. It might pay, say, $2 every year. Then after 10 years, for example, the government will pay the entire $100 back. This bond is auction off to the highest bidder and then can be traded on the bond market.\n\nAs a result, all sorts of people and organizations own bonds. Nearly anyone who wants to can buy bonds. Though some countries have laws limiting buying bonds from other countries they consider hostile.\n\nMany governments buy the bonds of other governments. That is all about controlling forex rates. Government like to have the ability to prevent steep declines in forex rates. To prevent that they intervene in the forex market and buy their own currency paying with another currency. Very often that other currency is the US dollar. Rather than holding dollars countries often hold bonds which can easily be sold in exchange for dollars.\n\nImagine that there's an emergency of some sort in India and the value of the rupee falls. The government needs to import some goods to deal with the emergency. They hold US bonds which they can sell for dollars then they can buy the goods for import with those dollars."

    "question": "This is not a call against conservative views. This is a request based solely on the fact that Fox News is deemed an \"entertainment\" media service and not a valid \"news\" media service. This was a decision made by SCOTUS.

(If there is a different case you are thinking of, let me know.)  Note that the decision in in reference to a single slimy hot-air idiot (Carlson) on a single program, not the entire network overall.

    "question": "I read a lot of posts asking about surviving or at least building a financially smart life on a 'meagre' 60k wage. I earn about 30k as a social worker and do alright. I mean I have to manage spending of course, but I'm not in trouble or anything, and seem to be able to use advice here as well. But I'm just wondering: is this mainly a sub for the more wealthy?",
    "answer": "36k earner here from Austria! That translates to 1.8k netto monthly. It has been my salary for about 2 years now. Previously my salary was 26k\/1.4k netto (PhD student) for about 3 years after which I was unemployed for 1½ years. My salary during that time was about 20k\/1.1k netto. All of these numbers are [below the median Austrian household income](http:\/\/www.statistik.at\/web_en\/statistics\/PeopleSociety\/social_statistics\/household_income\/index.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%202020%20EU,per%20annum%20at%20their%20disposal.). \n\nMost people tend to invest with whatever \"left over\" income they have at the end of the month. For me, it has always been the opposite - I'd always take out a fixed sum (even when I was unemployed) and lock it away. Then I'd figure out how to make do with what was left over. Despite the fact that I am making more than I used to, this habit has stuck. In my head, my salary is still just 1.4k. If I could make do on that salary for 3 years, I can jolly well do it now. As soon as the paycheck comes in, I lock 300 to 500 away and then figure out how to deal with the rest. \n\nThis sub has definitely been helpful for me and a few friends of mine. We are all in the 20k to 40k range. Based on what we've learned here, we've all started off a Sparplan and are putting away anywhere between €50 and €300 a month on the regular. It ain't much, but it's honest investing!\n\nWe all have anywhere between 1k and 4k as emergency funds and whenever we have spare cash, we stash it away and have anywhere between €100 and 5k saved over the span of a few months to a few years that we use for buying big dips whenever they happen. It's likely a good idea to invest this sum instead of trying to time the market, but we prefer doing it this way because transaction fees are ridiculous unless you go via a Sparplan."

Is it a matter of scale of printing?",
    "answer": "In the case of what the fed does right now, they are providing relief for a lack of liquidity through collateralised short term loans. Once those loans are paid back, the money is destroyed again. It's also not really money that enters the \"general economy\" but just to fulfill outstanding debt obligations between companies and banks.\n\nWhat countries like Venezuela did is different. They fund their governments through money creation, so the government can buy goods and services. That is money that does enter the economy, leading to inflation."

    "question": "From what I've read house prices being high and rapidly increasing is a good sign they may crash. I've read this in property investment guides and online about timing the cycle. Everywhere I look seems to assume that property prices will continue to rise well into the 2040s!\n\nNow I've read the average baby boomer will die in 2034, which will create a buyers market but no analysts from property firms or banks seem to agree. My sneaking suspicion is that they are wealthy and benefit from increasing house prices and wouldn't want anyone to know the party has to end eventually.",
    "answer": "The first point is that it's spectacularly hard to time bubbles. I haven't heard anyone say that prices will rise monotonically, and I would be skeptical of anyone who says they can predict year over year changes for the next twenty years. I certainly can't. There are also semantic questions of what exactly a \"crash\" is (are dropping prices a crash? is it determined by foreclosures?).\n\nStill, limiting ourselves to the near term (maybe the next five years), we can look at various reasons for why home prices are going up and ask ourselves if we think that these reasons could be signs of an impending crash. \n\nOn the demand side, one of the largest reasons for why some many people want homes now is that interest rates are at historic lows. It is considerably [cheaper to get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage than it ever has been](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/MORTGAGE30US). This will push up the price of homes because it means that more people are able to afford them. Importantly, [foreclosures are also at record lows](https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/mortgages\/foreclosures-fell-to-record-low-in-2020\/) (with the very important caveat that while they are especially low currently because the [Federal Government has issued a freeze on foreclosures for homes with federally backed mortgages](https:\/\/www.hud.gov\/press\/press_releases_media_advisories\/HUD_No_21_009)). There will likely be an uptick on foreclosures when the moratorium lifts, as the COVID-19 pandemic has meant that [more homeowners are behind on their mortgage payments](https:\/\/www.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publication\/103273\/housing-finance-at-a-glance-a-monthly-chartbook-november-2020_0.pdf) (pg 24). However, compared to the Great Recession, which saw historic levels of foreclosures on the backs of predatory loans, the low interest rates do not seem to be inviting people to take out loans they truly cannot afford. \n\nOn the supply side, the number of homes we are building has not kept pace with the increased demand for homes. The stock of available housing, which peaked in 2011 [has hit a historic low](https:\/\/www.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publication\/103273\/housing-finance-at-a-glance-a-monthly-chartbook-november-2020_0.pdf) (pg 20). This has been [exacerbated by the pandemic](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/us-underbuilding-housing-over-the-past-decade-2020-9), which caused many construction firms to cease production during the otherwise peak summer months.  [Housing construction has been trending up in the last decade](https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/united-states\/housing-starts); it just hasn't kept pace with demand. \n\nIt's possible that these trends will reverse. Interest rates could go up and the relative housing supply could increase. Both of these would push down prices. Still, something like the Great Recession where a substantial number of homeowners are unable to make their payments seems unlikely. The rise in foreclosures was driven by predatory loans where repayment relied on the promise of refinancing based on increased equity. I don't see evidence that this is happening. Maybe housing prices will fall (or at least stop increasing faster than inflation) in the next 10 years -- I don't know -- but I would not predict the housing market to collapse in the next few years."

Everyone wants to start a business, retire early, earn a boatload of money, and be \"financially independent\".\n\nI see YouTubers selling courses around these topics, making money by teaching how to make money. Sounds pretty scammy to me lol. These gurus are the only people who are actually becoming \"millionaires\" out of selling these courses.\n\nFrom all of this, what I understand and realize is that it is better to \"serve\" the trend than to \"follow\" the trend.\n\nThere's a famous saying - \"In a gold rush, sell shovels.\"\n\nAnyway, what do y'all think?\n\n[ ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ask\/comments\/zjo1sl\/the_millionaire_trend\/)",

In September alone, it sold $10 billion.

    "answer": "India has been accumulating foreign reserves for a long time since early 2010s (your source even has a chart on it.) Also, the ATH of $642.4B was hit on March 2022, not last year. Your source article also mentions that RBI will move away from intervening if this continues, they're not idiots. Posts like this are very bad since they do not provide any broader context for data and instead just selectively choose what to show.

    "answer": "The stock market is not the economy. The stock market consists disproportionately of medium and large companies. Different companies also depend on different markets, countries and supply chains. \nSo Brexit might not matter much for a business that does not operate in Britain - they can workaround the problems. The Suez channel blocking is bad for supply chains, but the relative ability of different companies to supply is hurt almost equally. On top of this, the Suez channel situation is temporary and will be over in two weeks at most (if the ships rerout around South Africa). \nThe value of a stock depends on the perceived ability of a company to be profitable long term.\nCovid hurt small businesses disproportionately, and the end is in sight. Brexit caused some slowdown on the markets I think, but it also offers new opportunities and doesn’t actually matter much for many companies worldwide. The channel, again, is a temporary issue. Even the loss of the entire ship’s cargo wouldn’t matter much, since all companies would miss out on only a single shipment (they’d still have products in store and get new products soon)."

    "answer": "$120k per year from $2.2 million means you need to average a 5.45% annual yield, There are lots of ways to do that.\n \nIf you prefer individual stocks you could go through this list of Dividend Kings https:\/\/www.financecharts.com\/screener\/dividend-kings\n\nand Dividend Aristocrats https:\/\/www.financecharts.com\/screener\/dividend-aristocrats\n\nand come up with a mix of stocks that produce the desired yield.\n\nOr, you could go with a mix of ETFs like r\/dividends darlings SCHD (3.14% annual yield) and JEPI (10.62% annual yield) to produce the desired dividends. Or a mix of SCHD, JEPI, Dividend Kings, and Dividend Aristocrats. Lots of possibilities. No need to take much risk with a relatively modest yield requirement.\n\nEDIT: One last thing. Consider moving to a state with no income tax. https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/0210\/7-states-with-no-income-tax.aspx\n\nYour investment income would be taxed by the feds only.

    "question": "There's this [article](https:\/\/monthlyreview.org\/2009\/05\/01\/why-socialism\/) by Einstein blatantly endorsing socialism.  \nI'd like to clarify that I have no dog in this fight, and I think Einstein being Einstein deserves the benefit of the doubt.  \nNow I read the article. It has some interesting points. Though it seems very idealistic in some cases.  \nMost discussions I've encountered about this article online and on reddit talk about whether Einstein's qualified to talk about this along with the typical socialism\/capitalism circlejerks.  \nNone are actually addressing the points being made in the article.  \nSo I'm curious to hear what economists have to say about the things written there.",
    "answer": "You should keep in mind that Einstein, while an excellent physicist, is about as educated in economics as your average Joe, and not instantly credible in the field of economics because he's good at physics. Same goes for an economist regarding physics. If an economist wrote a paper on general relativity with a bit more than average research (that probably isn't correct to begin with), would you take him seriously? Probably not. \n\nIn the article, he seems to be essentially saying that economics is not a real science by comparing it to astronomy, which isn't a very good argument. The field of economics does have a set methodology they use to conduct research. See Econ methodology FAQ in the sidebar of this sub.\n\nHe then appears to make the ethical argument for socialism, which, while completely ok, is outside the scope of economics.\n\nOverall this article isn't much different from any other. It ignores basic economic concepts and instead makes an ethical case, which an economist can't really respond to."

    "question": "Our population has barely grown, and we continue to add new homes.  Yet housing prices are up nearly everywhere.  I might expect this in San Francisco.  But Cleveland?  Pittsburgh?  I know individuals with 50 to 75 homes they rent.  Is that business model radically distorting the market?  Most people I know with “typical” jobs are in the $10-12\/h range, not enough to pay a $2,000\/month rent.  So, where is this heading?",
    "answer": "A housing shortage implies there are not enough houses where people need them, not that there aren’t enough houses as a raw count. \n\nI can build a million houses and offer free rent, but it means nothing to the people of NYC if I build them in rural Wyoming. And asking people to move as a solution to address housing isn’t feasible.\n\nI’m also not going to lower my rent if I’m a landlord just because I know there’s an extra supply of housing. Tenants are a pain and my apartment feels unique to *me* – the location, the quality, my attentiveness to detail, the schools – I have every reason under the moon to think my rent is fair and will wait before I can’t find anyone before lowering the rent. That doesn’t make maintenance cheaper, taxes lower, or tenants less annoying."

    "question": "Hi all,\n\nMy wife is applying for a separation and we will need to meet with someone to discuss division of assets and childcare. We have two children ages 5 and 8. I am on a good income ($130,000pa) and my wife is on under $30,000pa. We have always shared everything, but still find ourselves living week to week. We have a home with a mortgage, the deposit of which drained our finances. I never foresaw this being an issue, as I never imagined this situation.\n\nAt this stage we are living in the same home and continuing care of our children. We share a bank account with about $6,000 in savings. A $300,000 debt from our home and limited investments. I drive a banger of a car to and from work, and my wife drives our Kluger, valued at about $25,000.\n\nAny tips on managing the separation? Neither of us want to leave our family home.",
    "answer": "I was exactly in your situation. We decided to stay separated by live in the same house, just different rooms, Luckily we had a guest room. I had a good superannuation balance, her  - none. We agreed to not bring any dates home, and when we wanted to start a new relationship, that person would move out. We lived amicably for 5 further years, both dating, but not finding anyone special. When the time came to move out, I basically gave her the house - it had $300,00 equity with a $110,00 mortgage. I figured she was about to re-enter the workforce with only a high school education, no super, whereas I had a good-paying job with decent super. I also paid $250 a week towards the boys expenses until they got a job. I didn't want her living on struggle street age 55 still scraping the mortgage together. She now owns her house outright, makes a good average wage and is very happy, kids are happy - I re-married and moved in with my new wife. We are still good friends and talk once a week about the boys, and how each other is getting on. I recommend divorcing that way 100%. Be kind to each other."

    "question": "From what I've read house prices being high and rapidly increasing is a good sign they may crash. I've read this in property investment guides and online about timing the cycle. Everywhere I look seems to assume that property prices will continue to rise well into the 2040s!\n\nNow I've read the average baby boomer will die in 2034, which will create a buyers market but no analysts from property firms or banks seem to agree. My sneaking suspicion is that they are wealthy and benefit from increasing house prices and wouldn't want anyone to know the party has to end eventually.",
    "answer": "The housing market is extremely difficult to project. If you look back you can find someone claiming a crash every year. Eventually someone is right, but even then it’s often times regional.  Now dipping further you need to look at inflation.  We have been through several significant inflationary periods in the past 100 years.  The Fed, President, and Congress all have very aggressive stances toward pushing the economy forward. Even Republicans. The question isn’t, “are we creating inflation?” It’s, “Should we spend 1, 2, or 3 trillion?”  \n\nEventually all of that excess cash infusion will make its way to main street and prices everywhere will rise. When prices rise wages rise.  When wages rise there is more spending and a growth cycle continues. Don’t get caught thinking it’s 2008 when it’s more like 1968."

Inflation is likely to prove very sticky though. I went shopping today and while fruit and vegetables are still affordable things that used to be dirt cheap (like cheese sauce) are only for the super rich now!\n\nIn the medium to long term we're one of the very few countries where renewable energy works (i.e. we have an abundance of water and wind) and going forward can probably out-compete German manufacturing now they'll never again have affordable energy.\n\nIt's a shame because things are actually not to bad in the UK now but the politicians are in the process of wrecking it all."

Anybody can participate and the degree of decentralisation increases as the number of  independent participants grows.  The complexity of linking existing banking systems causes delays and inefficiencies which increase costs to a level that limits practical minimum transaction sizes.\n\nBy employing distributed ledger technology, we circumvent the current convoluted,  centralised global payment infrastructure, creating efficient and trustless networks.  The back-end code that powers the DApp runs autonomously on the decentralised network, rather than on centralised networks such as cloud hosting.

    "question": "I was reading Yuval Noah Harari's book *Sapiens*, and on page 136, he says, \"...it's a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.\"  There is no specific citation for this in the book, and it caught my eye because I had read that Thomas J. Stanley's book, *The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy,* said that [only 20% of millionaires inherited their riches.](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/0810\/7-millionaire-myths.aspx)\n\nI'm guessing that perhaps Harari is going off the Georgetown study that said [to succeed in America, it’s better to be born rich than smart](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/05\/29\/study-to-succeed-in-america-its-better-to-be-born-rich-than-smart.html) or talented?\n\nWould you say Harari's quote is true?  And is it inconsistent with Stanley's contention?",
    "answer": "I can't speak to the empirical facts, but simple logic decrees that these statements are not necessarily inconsistent:\n\n\"most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family\"\n\nvs. \n\n\"only 20% of millionaires inherited their riches.\"\n\nIt is entirely possible that being born into a rich family carries a host of economic advantages other than inheritance. E.g., children of rich families might go to better schools, get better medical care, better support outside of schools, have wealthier and more influential people in their social networks, and have a better financial safety net if they want to do something risky, like starting a new business or running for political office. Even if no one inherited anything (e.g., if there was a 100% estate tax), you would still expect children of rich families to start out with a considerable advantage in terms of lifetime earnings."

    "answer": "No (and yes).\r  \nFirst thing is that the price of any good or service in any given market is determined by the supply and demand of that specific service. Labor market, like it or not, is not different. So education and salaries, even if they are correlated since there are factors moderating their relation (like specialization) do not have a causal relationship.\n\n\r  \nSecond, there is a gap between giving somebody high education, and having that person working in jobs related to his high education experience. You may be a mechanical engineer and end up working as a bartender. This is happening in many economies around the globe.\r\n\nWhen you consider a closed environment (let's say that we lock everybody up in X country and nobody can enter or leave) if you give high education to 100% of the population, the only thing that is going to happen, is that these skills will decrease in value as there will be an oversupply, and probably, lack of enough demand. On the other hand, low skilled jobs will be in high demand, so the salaries of the first will go down, and the salaries of low skilled jobs will go up, and eventually, you will have people that are engineers and rather work in a low skilled job. So, no, education does not cause that shortage by itself.\n\n\r  \nBut, and here comes the trick, we don't live in closed environments. If high skilled employees are not paid enough, before going to work to low skilled manual jobs, many will leave the country, and you will have a brain drain."

When the company recruiter asked me what my target salary was, I responded by asking, \"What is the range for the position?\" to which they responded with their target, which was $30k more than I was expecting\/am making now. Essentially, if I would have given the range I was hoping for (even if it was +$10k more than I am making it now) I still would have sold myself short. \n\nGranted, this is just an interview and not an offer- but I'm happy knowing that I didn't lowball myself from the getgo.

It is a dance. I usually ask on the first call from the headhunter \/ recruiter \"What is the general range of compensation for this position?\" . This is something they normally have in front of you, and the person cold calling is usually not the person who does the 'negotiation' to see your starting range. \n\nThere have been a couple times the HR absolutely would not budge and required a number. I would simply say \"Between *75% of current pay* and *25% more than current pay* ,depending on the benefits and job responsibilities\". If you get backed into a corner, put a big range, and then later say ... the benefits aren't nearly good enough, and the responsibility is high enough that the low offer simply isn't an option.  \n\nThis is coming from a software developer specializing in Cloud\/SAAS\/Agile\/Medical\/Finance , so your mileage may vary.

    "question": "i’ve seen a bunch of different figures for how much the money supply rose in 2020, but surely if there was a 35% increase in the money supply there’d be an increase of 35% inflation? is that not what the fisher equation shows?",
    "answer": "&gt;is that not what the fisher equation shows?\n\nNo. The fisher eq just states that real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation. The money supply isn't part of that at all.\n\n&gt;but surely if there was a 35% increase in the money supply there’d be an increase of 35% inflation?\n\nNo. First of all, to state the obvious, there isn't.\n\nEverything else being equal and all new money going towards consumption, this would be the case. But everything else *isn't* equal.\n\nMonetary policy doesn't happen in a vacuum, significant changes are usually a response to a change in economic conditions. In this case, the increase was so substantial to avoid the *deflation* that would have occured thanks to the economic shock by the pandemic. You had a fall in output, a fall in how quickly money changed hands, and in response an increase in the money supply.\n\nNotable is also that behaviour in of itself matters. That's why central banks generally try to communicate their policy clearly and try to communicate policy changes ahead of time, so that expectations are in line with it. What people *believe* about inflation changes their actions and alters de facto inflation just as changes in the money supply do.\n\nUltimately in an economy you always have a mix of factors that push inflation up or down, the job of the central bank is to counteract these factors in order to reach their target of low and stable inflation. That's not always a perfect process, central bankers are neither wizards nor can they perfectly anticipate the future, but it does mean that \"why did the central bank alter the money supply\" is an important question to ask."

    "question": "So my wife has been looking for part time work from home jobs to supplement my income. She found a virtual assistant position and applied.\n\nThe company offered her a position without interviewing her. It's for 6-7 hours a week making hotel and travel reservations. She will be paid $400 a week, and $30 extra per hour over 7 hours as needed.\n\nShe asked some questions and got an odd response that felt canned. Basically she said she would receive a check for $2950 that would cover the first week's pay, the cost of a printer and paper, as well as booking software.\n\nThis all feels like a scam, but I don't know how. Has anyone run into this? What should I be asking\/looking for?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the responses everyone. I should have phrased this a bit differently. I knew this was a scam, I just didn't know how. I appreciate all of the advice for legitimate work from home options.",
    "answer": "This is 8000% a scam, and a very well-known one. Your wife will get a check and be told to cash it and then send $X to the \"printer company\" and keep the rest as her pay. There is no printer company. She is sending money to the scammer. The check will later bounce, and the bank will deduct the full $2950 from her account. She'll then be out the money that she sent for the \"printer,\" and possibly incur overdraft fees as well if it causes an overdraft.\n\nThe way this works is that the scammer uses a bad check, but that looks good enough to pass initial muster. It then gets credited to the account within X business days according to the bank's policy, but just because the money is available in your account doesn't mean a check has actually cleared. It takes a few weeks on the back end to make sure the check is legitimate and the account it's drawn on has sufficient funds to cover it, and once they realize it's no good they pull the money back from the account it was deposited in.\n\nTell her to run from this job, and she can report the person to the police if she wants to, though I doubt they'll actually catch them. In general, if it sounds too good to be true ($57\/hour for making travel reservations from home is *way* too good to be true), it usually is."

    "answer": "The short answer is that the Viennese government uses a combination of subsidy and direct government construction to get around any negative supply effects caused by rent control.\\* The city itself is also in a lot of ways more free market than most US cities; single-family zoning doesn't exist in Vienna, comparatively around [75% of land zoned for housing in the US is zoned exclusively for single](https:\/\/www.planetizen.com\/definition\/single-family-zoning) family homes; [their building codes are also much more permissive](https:\/\/slate.com\/business\/2021\/12\/staircases-floor-plan-twitter-housing-apartments.html) and allow for cheaper construction than the US; they have much more streamlined building processes.\n\nThe other answer is that they do also have some of the negative characteristics associated with rent control. In particular, they have a two year residency requirement for social housing plus a waitlist. I don't have a source for typical wait times or for how easy it is to get a rental in the private market, though.

That is obviously a much bigger ratio of democrats to republicans relative to the general population.

I felt professional economists would have probably thought about this before so I wanted to get their opinion of what issues might be encountered in an alternate regime of taxing net income.",

    "question": "So, unfortunate circumstances have made me a millionaire over night at the age of 37.\n\nI remember stating that if I wasn’t a millionaire by age 40, i would blow my brains out.\n\nBe it as it may, my grandfather passed away from old age, and unbeknownst to me, he left me his mansion in the sweetest part of town, and a his childhood home which is about 2 hrs away; also in a prime location.\n\nMy aunts and uncles screwed me and my mom out of everything when my grandmother  passed away, since she left no will. All certificates were then modified to favor them.\n\nBut now, as hard of a situation this is, the tables turned.\n\nI will not be selling my homes or any art of jewelry. I am not allowed to anyways, for 5 years.\n\nI have received 450k cash along with this.\n\nWhat’s the best way to work these 450 so I don’t have to sell my homes for millions of dollars.\n\nThanks",

    "question": "So I understand that Bidens tax plan will only affect individual incomes of over $400k, but what about the increase in corporate taxes? There's fear from the opposition that corporate taxes don't truly affect the corporation as much as it eventually affects the consumer. I guess I'm looking for a rebuttal to this point. I can totally envision a major multi million dollar company getting taxed more, but increasing their prices while finding more reasons to go offshore. Thanks and hoping for a prosperous presidency!",
    "answer": "A detailed economic [analysis](https:\/\/budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu\/issues\/2020\/9\/14\/biden-2020-analysis) of the Biden platform was done at the Wharton Business School (Trump's alma mater, ironically), which said the following:\n\n&gt; Under the Biden tax plan, households with adjusted gross income (AGI) of $400,000 per year or less would not see their taxes increase directly but would see lower investment returns and wages as a result of corporate tax increases. Those with AGI at or below $400,000 would see an average decrease in after-tax income of 0.9 percent under the Biden tax plan, compared to a decrease of 17.7 percent for those with AGI above $400,000 (the top 1.5 percent).\n\nIt also summarizes the general impact of the Biden platform, finding that it would result in a reduced debt and increased GDP growth relative to the status quo:\n\n&gt; PWBM finds that over the 10-year budget window 2021 – 2030, the Biden platform would raise $3.375 trillion in additional tax revenue and increase spending by $5.37 trillion. Including macroeconomic and health effects, by 2050 the Biden platform would decrease the federal debt by 6.1 percent and increase GDP by 0.8 percent relative to current law. Almost 80 percent of the increase in taxes under the Biden tax plan would fall on the top 1 percent of the income distribution.\n\nIn short, the Biden tax plan would result in slightly lower wages and returns on investment for those with incomes under $400,000, but would not directly increase their taxes. His platform would also reduce the national debt and boost GDP growth relative to Trump's policies. I hope that answers the question."

    "question": "(throwaway acct) From a pure financial perspective I’m set with $3MM non-real estate. I’m not “super wealthy”, but I’m good to go. Challenges are: 1) I don’t really know what to do next — this is the big one. 2) None of my friends are in the same boat, which can present real issues. No one knows I’m in such a good spot. 3) Earning $400K + nice benefits, and I’m just gonna walk away? 4) College for my kids will be taken care of, but I’m not sure I could be so selfish as to spend down savings on wife and I, while kids might potentially start with little (just like I did, but... I admit that a huge part of feeling “successful” is that I can pay it forward to my kids as well as charitable causes close to my heart). ",

If you want to go clean cages at an animal shelter for minimum wage, you can do that too.  Or, you can take risks.  You can tell your boss no.  You can go home early from work and spend some time with your wife and kids.  You can take days off and go to little Suzy's piano recital or Timmy's baseball game.  You can take your wife to a cabin in the woods for a week and alternate between sitting in a wood fired hot tub and going at it like rabbits.  Maybe you will be ready to retire early next year instead.  But today you should enjoy life and enjoy all the hard work that it took to get to fuck you money status."

He mostly watches major news channels and tickers on TV.\n\nHowever, a lot of the media on major news networks is decidedly negative, sensational, biased, and not entirely accurate (usually by omission) and it is making him go insane. It is affecting his mental health, making him more afraid of our world, extremely depressed, and causing him to develop views that aren't accurately reflected in society. I really worry about him and wish he could be happier. \n\nThere has got to be a better way to get up-to-date economic information. Do y'all have any ideas?",
    "answer": "Professional economists typically try to stay up to date on economic literature in their respective fields by reading journals and do not watch the news.\n\nEcon Twitter, when they’re not shitposting (which admittedly is most of the time) does occasionally add some value when they recommend or advertise prominent literature or debate methods. For me, it honestly helps me keep up to date with latest econometric methods because I don’t actively seek out reading that literature.\n\nIf his work is more focused on keeping up with recent trends in macro policy or global financial markets, without needing to go into the nitty gritty of academic literature, I would recommend the Economist over all of the other news sources."

Yet: What I find is that those who lean too much into this logic of optimization are the ones that suffer from a (literal) maddening degree of alienation.\n\nIt's an easy trap to fall into as it is so very *sensible*: Why would you spend six hours cleaning (doing a chore you hate and doing it badly) if you could just work an additional hour and outsource that? So you hire a cleaner. And a cook, a personal shopper, an interior designer and a nanny. But if you don't watch out, all your little self worth eggs, so to speak, are kept in the same work basket - and, step by step, you start to live the life of a stranger. You eat the food of someone else, wear the clothes of not-you, in an apartment that might as well be a hotel room, with kids that are more attached to their nanny than to you. Your vacations are glamorous, but there's little connection to anyone or anything in them. At this point you might start to feel a little unease. You might start to wonder why you're unfulfilled and try to treat yourself better - so you double down. You get a PA because dealing with a schedule is annoying, you get a personal trainer because *mens sana in corpore sano* and while you're at it, you also start therapy, where you learn techniques that help somewhat and where you analyze childhood events. But what somehow is kept at bay, in a fish-not-having-a-word-for-water-way, is that you identify with your job of optimizing processes to maximum efficency to a degree that you treat yourself like any work project. What I am getting at here is: Watch out. It may be easier and more worth it to develop an interest in cooking or join a sports club or a gym that you like. But also: Screw cleaning."

    "question": "Sure, we'd all feel the pain, but apparently we need the pain, and we wouldn't have to help an industry that won't give even one sick day to rail workers.  Are interest rate hikes the only acceptable mechanism to control inflation?",
    "answer": "It should be noted that a rail strike wouldn't necessarily reduce inflation, as it would slow down shipping for both intermediate products for production and final products to market. The former would impact production costs and increase prices as a result, whereas the latter would reduce market supply and increase prices as well. The result would most likely be higher prices for goods and an economic downturn as a result of businesses struggling to ship cross-country and consumers struggling to buy affected goods.\n\n(I should note that threatening to strike is not necessarily a bad thing, and I support rail workers in their strike action should they choose to take it. Given the importance of rail infrastructure for cross-country shipping and given the threat that a work stoppage would pose for the economy, it should go without saying that the workers that operate that system should be taken seriously and given what are ultimately pretty small demands anyways, especially in the context of labour provisions provided in other OECD countries.)"

    "question": "JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said on Monday the investment bank is sitting on $500 billion in cash in anticipation of higher inflation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has been \"effectively stockpiling more and more cash\" in anticipation of investing at higher rates rather than putting money into Treasuries and other investments now, he said at Morgan Stanley's US Financials, Payments &amp; Commercial Real Estate Conference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"We have a lot of cash and capability and we're going to be very patient, because I think you have a very good chance inflation will be more than transitory,\" Dimon, the longest-serving CEO among the big US banks, said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInflation means fiat is worth less, no? So why stockpile fiat?",
    "answer": "Because inflation that is not transitory will be met with a response of tapering from the fed — when this happens and they increase interest rates, it will set off a chain reaction of events. \n\nThe most important one(s) in the context of your question is it will make businesses harder to grow because of higher lending rates, and it will push much of the markets back into bonds.  You you could at that point (arguably) get a better rate of return on a fixed income (in theory, less risk) instrument rather than risk it in current markets. \n\n This all means there will be a correction (who’s size is unknown but sounds like dimon is betting it will be on the big end), which is what he’s hoping for to put that extra cash to work"

    "question": "[This argument for mandating 100% reserve requirements is compelling to me.](https:\/\/blog.p2pfoundation.net\/the-100-reserve-requirement-for-banks-a-proposal-by-herman-daly\/2010\/05\/08) It makes me wonder why banks were allowed to do anything else in the first place. Why is this allowed?",
    "answer": "In essence, reserve requirements are not going to be 100% for the same reason that we won’t require insurance companies to have a 100% reserve: the chances of a simultaneous withdrawal at 100% is almost infinitesimally small, and the chances of it happening across the whole financial system would imply we were on the verge of complete societal collapse already.\n\nSo what do we get from giving up the 100% reserve requirement? Now banks can do things with your money- they can offer loans (generally good for the economy that we have credit) and they are happy to hold your money for free.\n\nWhat would happen if the reserve requirement was 100%? As banks can no longer loan out your money, they’d likely want to charge you (potentially exorbitant) fees to go through the process of holding and securing it. Loans would have to come entirely from financial capital already owned by lenders, which would massively reduce the supply of credit. \n\nAll in all, the benefits outweigh the risks."

So while more companies will think about outsourcing, I doubt we will see a drastic shift. \n\nBut what could happen is overall wage reduction for remote workers if they move out of the expensive areas like the Bay area into more rural lands. A lot of people would take that pay cut if rent was cheaper. \n\n\nAnd also lets not forget other issues with remote work that will force companies to call everyone back into the office when they can.

That being said, a majority of my studies revolve around measuring\/improving social welfare, and on the theory side, maximizing social welfare. Conversely, conservative types seem to get all of their economic ideologies from Micro 101. The problem with this, is the policies suggested in introductory courses are made under the assumption that the markets are perfectly competitive, which is not typically the case in the real world."

I hope your investments continue to work magic!",
    "answer": "Our country has various benefits for why dividend investing should be a top priority for each Canadian. For example our dividend tax is 30% as opposed to Americans at 50% and companies that pay 4%+ dividends are usually one of very few in a controlled market. \n\nI pick what I believe to be the best company in each sector that shows growth of dividends, revenue, income, equity, over at least a 10 year timeframe. Why care about the latter 3 you may ask? Because of my goals!\n\nMy goals: \n\n1. Capital preservation - every investor should hold their first goal in investing as being able to preserve their original investment. By investing in only high dividend yielding stocks, you risk your actual equity side of the investment because usually these companies focused on solely dividends issue debt in order to keep paying them out to attract shareholders. A quick indicator of this is happening is to check the payout ratio (should be 50-70% for traditional companies).\n\n2. Dividend income - obviously this is the another reason why you would be looking at building such a portfolio. Try to aim for 4%+ dividend yield! I wouldn’t exclude solid companies that can make your portfolio more defensive just cause they have low dividend yields, you can always balance it out if you are creative.\n\n3. Capital appreciation - Not sure what planet some people may be coming from but it’s not a good look to have bought a stock 20 years ago and today it’s trading at the same price. They should be at least keep up with inflation (2%) otherwise your money is slowly getting burned. To determine how you can find a company with solid capital appreciation and solid dividends, just take a look at consistencies in revenue and income growth. \n\nThe portfolio:\n\nFortis - 47 years of dividends  nuff said it’s literally a linear regression, if you are really picky buy when it taps the EMA on the monthly (hint: just did a few days ago). Pays 4% dividend and ppl need to pay their power bill it’s a century trade. \n\nTD - Guess what? We have some of the greatest financial institutions in the entire world based on regulation and accountability! imo this bank is the best in Canada going forward with the highest revenue, income growth in their industry whilst continuing to pay dividends. Kinda rare to see such massive growth for a Canadian company especially a bank but this is because they are focused on our neighbours down south! RBC is a close second but I like the colour green baby $$$. Pays 4% dividend\n\nEnbridge - just lol. This industry was beaten to a pulp from our government and it isn’t a good look to be invested in. They pay a solid dividend at 6-7% and are throwing most of their remaining cash into projects that will create more renewable infrastructure. Their management doesn’t have to lie to their shareholders cause they aren’t directly in on oil so they can tell them, “look 2050 our revenue is gonna be nearly 100% renewable”. These guys are in it for the long hall - this I evaluate as my riskier bet but the high dividend yield will allow me to pick a super conservative stock that has low dividend (2%) to balance out back to our 4%.\n\nCNR - speaking of conservative stocks we got CNR it’s I think the widest moat and hardest hurdle to jump into the ring with because who in their right mind is gonna put up $100B in CAPEX to build a railroad, plus jump through all the provincial legislation hoops, and all the aborigines treaties. Yeah not likely right? CP was the only other company I considered for this sector nothing wrong with that company but I needed a purely safe bet to balance out “risk on” bets so here we are. I think it pays 2% dividend\n\nBAM.A - this is just a sexy stock honestly and it gives you exposure into real estate among various other businesses internationally without getting destroyed by crap management, large issuance of debt, and dividend baiting. This is the growthiest stock of them all and they also pay roughly 2% yield. \n\nBCE - high dividend at 6% yield, biggest telecom in Canada, 5G coming, tbh not really all that excited with where cable is going in the future so I may transition this into Telus because I see more growth through their wireless and teledoc initiatives.\n\nManulife - this is your unsexy boring insurance company stock but hey they got great constant growth over the years and pay a dividend that meets our goal of 4% so let’s pick it up\n\nAlgonquin - they got rekt from I think the texas power outage if I’m not mistaken recently? So good buying opportunity. Same sort of idea - high revenue growth, high dividend growth, only concern is the income growth this is I believe the lowest income generator based on market cap and revenue compared to the rest in the list. Also if you aren’t comfortable with so much overlap you already have fortis and BAM.A which owns BIP which owns utilities too. This you can leave out and toss more into fortis or Brookfield."

Lived in a $2k apartment and had a serious girlfriend at the time.\n\nThis windfall will change your life dramatically, in ways you can’t even imagine today. It has taken me years to get acclimated to a new lifestyle... one that is filled with different possibilities, different opportunities, different friendships, different power dynamics, different social influence, different lovers than ever before.\n\nMy advice to you would be to take it slowly. Don’t make any drastic decisions. You’re young, what’s the rush? To the best of your abilities, pretend like the money doesn’t exist for awhile. This will allow you to carefully navigate the transition and reflect at each step of the way — what kind of person do you want to be? Do you want to be a rich asshole or a kind, humble and caring? Do you want to buy a Ferrari or drive a Tesla Model 3? To be clear, these are rhetorical questions. What I’m saying is that you should critically analyze the choices you make at each step of the way, and think about what it means for the person you’re growing into. I believe this slow and steady introspection will lead you to the right path.\n\nSo why not keep working your current job for now? Why not stay at your current apartment for a little while?\n\nFor me, I kept my job and ended up finding deep fulfillment learning how to build effective teams and how to empower others. I stayed in my $2k apartment for a year or so, and then upgraded to a multi-million dollar house. I realized who my true friends really are. I found love. I constantly reflected on the person I was becoming, and found deeper purpose in life.\n\nThat’s what worked for me, anyways. Your mileage may vary. Congrats and good luck!"

    "question": "Productivity in Brazil has been stagnant for 30 years. We were richer than China in the early 1990s, but now we are humiliated in every way. Why did this happen?",
    "answer": "A failure to climb the value chain. [Here](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b9\/Rank_in_the_Economic_Complexity_Index%2C_OWID.svg) is a map of countries by economic complexity - the diversity of skills, knowledge, and productive capabilities in a country. From the [full list](https:\/\/atlas.cid.harvard.edu\/rankings), Japan is #1, South Korea #4, China #16, and Brazil #53, behind famously commodity-dependent Russia. Brazil's [top exports](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1191541\/products-exported-from-brazil\/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Brazil%20most%20exported,U.S.%20dollars%20worth%20of%20exports.) are agricultural and raw materials, while China's [top exports](https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/china\/exports) are all manufactured goods. Contra popular belief, the bulk of these now adays are not labor intensive consumer products, but capital intensive and complex products: the top 5 are mechanical &amp; industrial products, machinery &amp; transport equipment, high tech products, automatic data processing equipment, and cell phones.\n\nIt should be noted as well that countries like Japan, South Korea, and China are the exception, where Brazil is the norm. Countless other promising economies like Turkey, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, and even India have been trapped in boom and bust cycles.\n\nUnderstanding this requires an understanding of the different economic strategies employed. Until 1931, the economic reputation of Japan was the same as that of Brazil today: the country of the future... and always would be. It was fueled by exports of labor intensive industrial products, silk, and rayon. The barriers to entry in this business were low and a few large companies controlled the international distribution chain, just as a few large trading firms control the exports of Brazilian agricultural and mineral products today. The result was low profits and frequent market crashes whenever the international market worsened.\n\nFrom 1931 to 1954, Japanese bureaucrats tested and perfected a strategy to climb the value chain and shift to more capital intensive industries with higher barriers to entry. It involved 1) limiting competition in low-barrier industries to increase the rate of profit, 2) channeling profits from low-barrier industries into \"strategic sectors\": the next rung on the value chain (i,e. textiles to steel, steel to machinery, machinery to consumer appliances, consumer appliances to automobiles), and 3) restricting foreign competition in strategic sectors until they could *outcompete* foreigners. This strategy was imitated by South Korea and later China.\n\nIt of course had downsides. For one, restricting competition in a low-barrier industry is tantamount to imposing a consumption tax on the public: they bear the burden of higher prices. Restricting imports also increases prices until local strategic sectors can mature. Finally, in the short-term, this policy defies comparative advantage: strategic sectors begin very inefficient. It only succeeded because, over time, the \"experience curve\" (brief summary of the concept [here](https:\/\/hbr.org\/1985\/03\/building-strategy-on-the-experience-curve)) changes comparative advantages over time.\n\nUnderstanding its advantages is less straightforward. As mentioned, industries up the value chain have higher barriers to entry, so they tend to also have higher margins, but not always. More importantly, compensation is better. Economic growth is highly counter-intuitive. Most people will interpret \"6% growth\" as \"the average person in country X is getting 6% richer a year\". In practice, it's more like 6% of the people have seen their incomes increase greatly this year, while most people's real incomes have barely changed. Assume you live in a town with a textile mill where most workers are being paid $15 an hour. A windshield glass factory opens next door and offers $30 and a sizable share of the town's incomes have doubled. The impression often given by economists is that the face of economic growth is that textile mill getting more and more efficient, when in practice it's that glass factory opening and doubling local wages. \n\nThat glass factory starts with a far higher input cost than its competitors due to being on the left hand of the experience curve, but over time equalizes with them. In that time, it either requires huge amounts of capital to stay afloat, unnatural advantages like government subsidies, free land, or tax benefits, or both. Japan, South Korea, and China had their attention on building the glass factories and giving them that capital and those unnatural advantages: uncompetitive trade policies, free land harborside, infrastructural development meant to lower transportation costs specifically around a few industrial parks, hostile labor policy, and tax incentives (including tax deductions on buying their products) all but guaranteed those industries would be in the black from day 1, even if their methods were very inefficient. Then, when they became more efficient, they became dominant in export markets for a while, both because they still had *most* of these advantages (though would lose \"strategic sector\" privileges shortly after this point), and because wages hadn't caught up with the rest of the world.\n\nAs wages rose and certain industries stopped becoming profit leaders, *they* would then become the new \"textile industry\" and see competition limited and profits redirected to fund a new class of \"strategic sectors\". The state in Japan, China, and South Korea managed a never-ending cannibalism of industries to fund increasingly capital-intensive ones.\n\nThe growth model in boom and bust dependent \"failed miracle economies\" was very different. In Turkey and Brazil, just to give two examples, growth was typically driven by FDI. That FDI took advantage of relatively low wages, and, in some areas, relatively high levels of skill and education to create export-oriented businesses. Those businesses would then turn a profit for a while, but the influx of foreign capital into the country increased the value of the currency, and thereby decreased competitive of exports. Eventually, black balance sheets would go red and foreign investors would flee. These economies crashed into low wages and cheap currency again and once again became attractive to investors, so this cycle started over. All the while there were only very limited attempts to \"collect\" profits of industries further down the value chain and establish higher value chain industries: the only real initiative to do this were the establishment of a few public sector firms (on a much smaller order of magnitude than what was happening in East Asia) and periods of increased investment in education.\n\nThe difference between the rare miracle economies and the mass of disappointments came down to political incentives. Too often this is oversimplified to \"dictatorships focus on the long term while democracies focus on the short term\": this ignores the fact that most of the world's poor countries are dictatorships. Rather, we have to adopt a nuanced understanding of Northeast Asian governments during the boom years. They were not democracies where leaders are accountable to the public (even Japan is essentially a one party state), nor were they \"traditional\" autocracies where the leader is accountable to no one. Rather, for thousands of years, Confucian rulers have been accountable to *the palace*. The expectation has always been that the top leader is the public face of the regime but allows his ministers to govern autonomously, controlling only who gets promoted and fired. Whenever a leader - even an absolute monarch - lacks virtue or ability, there is a long tradition of his ministers either removing him or turning him into a puppet (we've seen this even in modern years with Jiang Zemin). The result in all the Asian miracle economies was an \"economic general staff\" that ran the country with 10 and 20 year timetables in mind, and that was relatively insulated from politics."

    "question": "I can't understand very well why workers simply don't get a raise according to inflation for every year of work. I'm not so cynical that I think that companies are simply exploiting more more from the workers, but it does seem very suspicious that it's hard to get a raise in the same position after a year, even if it's just to stay even with inflation. \n\nSo what could be a possible consequence if, say, everyone got a raise very year according to a given inflation index? And what would this imply in periods of hyperinflation, where you would need to raise everyone's wages every week or so? (Assuming that paperwork is easy, just interested in economic effects, not practical ones).",
    "answer": "This might sound great and fair, but it's very much doubtful this is a good idea.\n\nFirst of all, this sets you right on track to a wage-price spiral. Inflation happens, which forces companies to raise wages, which leads to further inflation, until you end up in a situation where wages keeping up with inflation is the least of your problems. The currency goes down the drain, imports get super expensive, lending unreasonable, etc.\n\nSecond of all, wages are rigid downward. People don't like wage cuts, surprise. Inflation helps companies during downturns by lowering real wages, and helps them to avoid firing people or going under instead.\n\nThird of all, what about dying industries? Eventually the revenue you generate falls below your wage, right now you'd still have the choice to accept a lower wage, if you couldn't cut wages, people would against just get fired.\n\nMedian real wage growth is usually positive, wages *do* keep up with inflation, just not always and not immediately."

    "question": "There are a lot of people in [this post](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/SubredditDrama\/comments\/oe89i4\/rgaming_argues_about_a_16yearold_scalper_who_has\/) who are angry at scalpers. And I get that, if you have to pay 2x MSRP for a PS5 then of course it doesn’t feel good. \n\nBut that’s *literally* what happens in a shortage. You aren’t able to get things \n\nHowever, what a lot of these people seem to get wrong is that, even if scalpers *didn’t* exist, it would have no effect on the supply. There would still be the same number of PS5s as before. You wouldn’t have a better chance of getting a PS5.\n\nWhen scalpers exist to regulate the free market, the person with the highest marginal value for a PS5 will be able to get it. When scalpers don’t exist, the same thing will happen. Sure, people would resell the goods but people would pay in other ways—for example by waiting in line longer. \n\nThis is all basic economics. Am I just stupid or do most redditors not understand basic economics concepts like this?",
    "answer": "Think of it this way, every individual who is able to purchase a console at the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP), despite being willing to pay more, would experience an economic gain. Every additional dollar they have to pay to a scalper reduces their economic gain and increases the scalper's.\n\nIf you would pay $1,000 for a console, but are able to get it for only $500, that's an extra $500 in your pocket and possibly some intangible happiness. If you have to pay $1,000 for the console, you realize no gain. Even though the market as a whole might be functioning efficiently in the latter scenario where you pay $1k, a rational consumer would prefer the former where they realize a gain.\n\nWhile the actions of the scalper might be rational, his profit is in some cases derived from the losses of people who would have otherwise been able to purchase the console at MSRP. While the scalpers don't affect total supply, they do affect demand, which can increase the market price.\n\nI think what you have to understand is that while this does seem rational from the perspective of the free market in basic economics, the real world is composed of individuals who are subject individual gains and losses as well as location differences, search costs, and expectations.\n\nLet's consider how some of these other things can affect individual opinions against the behaviors of a rational economic actor like a scalper:\n\n1. Location Differences - While you're correct that the scalper's actions will not have any effect on overall supply, they can impact local supply and demand. When some profit-seeking individuals purchase large quantities of these consoles, they can reduce the quantity of consoles available in their local area, because the scalper might be able to make a greater profit selling it online to a different city or state. A Walmart in Giddings, Texas might receive a limited quantity of PS5s because of the relatively small population and median household income of [$44,000](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/quickfacts\/fact\/table\/giddingscitytexas\/IPE120219v). A scalper who purchases all of their consoles and sells them to individuals in New York City with a median income of [$64,000](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/quickfacts\/fact\/table\/newyorkcitynewyork\/IPE120219) might price them above what an individual in Giddings is able to pay. While it makes sense for the scalper from an economic perspective, individuals in certain locations might not appreciate being forced to compete with other areas earning higher median incomes.\n2. Search Costs - Some consumers are not price sensitive, so the search costs for a console are minimal, because they're willing to pay the market price of a console on an auction site. For these consumers, scalpers can provide a valuable service by drastically reducing their cost (time spent) searching for a console.  \nOther consumers who are price sensitive might only be willing to purchase a console if it's below a certain price. For them, the added demand from scalpers and potentially reduced local supply of consoles can increase their costs of searching for a console.\n3. Expectations are an important part of economics that can influence opinion and behavior. In this case, people expect to be able to purchase a console at MSRP, and scalpers are economic agents who act explicitly for the purpose of selling consoles above MSRP. The actions of the scalper undermine peoples' expectations of what they feel is fair, which could explain the overwhelming negative response.\n\nEven though the actions of the scalper are rational due to limited supply, some individuals bear the economic costs of their actions either through a higher purchase price, lack of a local supply, or increased search costs. Additionally, many people expect being able to purchase a console at MSRP, and might view the actions of the scalper as undermining their expectations.\n\n*Edit: I focused my comment on why people might justifiably be angry at scalpers, but as* u\/YaYaOnTour *correctly pointed out in their* [*comment*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/oenoun\/am_i_just_dumb_or_does_reddit_really_not\/h482so4)*, a more complete response should have mentioned that scalpers create a benefit for people who are willing to pay more for a console but unable to find one. I made that a bit clearer in the section on Search Costs.*"

    "question": "My girlfriend has this political opinion that every person should be paid the exact same wage, no matter what job they do. I don’t know enough about economics to explain why this wouldn’t work. Looking for some insight.",
    "answer": "Here are a few common problems people bring up about this kind of proposal:\n\n1) Jobs that are more difficult, [more dangerous](https:\/\/advisorsmith.com\/data\/most-dangerous-jobs\/), or just more unpleasant will not be filled now.  We call the difference in salary needed to get someone to do these jobs \"compensating wage differentials\".  Who would go down in the coal mines, fight in the army, work with toxic chemicals all day, or clean out the clogs in the sewer system?\n\n2) What about people who start their own business?  Exact same wage implies that there will be no reward for doing this.  Who will work hard to invent better ways of doing things (or curing cancer)?  Again, with no reward system available, it isn't going to happen.\n\n3) There is no incentive to **work hard**, either. With no way of getting raises, no way of getting a promotion, it is difficult to see why people would *work hard*.  Everyone might phone it in, all the time.  What are you going to do to me if I don't do any work at all?  I can always get another job making exactly the same thing. (This is the **opposite** of the \"efficiency wage\" idea, where you might pay someone more just for the fact that they will work harder to avoid losing the job.)\n\n4) \"But human beings just love working, and will do all of these things anyway\", your girlfriend says. Sadly. most people do not agree.  I would be searching for the cushiest job I would enjoy the most (petting kittens, playing competitive video games whether I'm any good or not, be a member of a band), and will do the minimum I have to. \n\n5) What about jobs that require 6-10 years of schooling and training before you ever get paid?  Are we going to pay the students the same amount as well?  Then, I change my answer-- I will be a student for the rest of my life.  I will be really good at it though!\n\n6) Think about this \"same wage\", what we will be paying a 16 year old kid. What about a single mother who has 5 kids?  What about a single father who went to Med school with 5 kids who is also responsible for taking care of his parents? You are going to limit him to the same salary, so that they now starve?\n\n7) What about people who earn money on Patreon or similar platforms? What about people who are really good at earning tips because they do a great job?  Are we making laws preventing people from voluntarily giving other people money? \n\n8) Finally-- many people who make the \"same wage\" argument are also in favor of confiscating all the wealth, and dividing it equally among everyone.  What they fail to see is that within one month, some people will have spent or lost all of the money (we know what happens to many [lottery winners](https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/net-worth\/bankruptcy\/lottery-winners-who-lost-millions\/)), and people who are savvy\/inventive\/desire to save and invest\/have that entrepreneurial bug in them will all of a sudden have a lot more.  ***How often are you proposing we reconfiscate and redistribute everything?***  Every night before bedtime?\n\nAs you can see, **really** trying to do this in the real world will have a lot of problems. And as you start creating exceptions for the issues I have raised above, or creating extra laws\/rules saying that people **must work hard**, you quickly see that we are getting very far away from some utopian ideal.\n\n[Here is an article about a real company that tried it](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-55800730) for its own employees, but they realized very soon that it just didn't work."

    "question": "\n\nPigzbe is a decentralised application that allows people to create their own enclosed, autonomous financial networks and to exchange money within them.   Decentralisation means that no central authority is needed for operation. Anybody can participate and the degree of decentralisation increases as the number of  independent participants grows.  The complexity of linking existing banking systems causes delays and inefficiencies which increase costs to a level that limits practical minimum transaction sizes.\n\nBy employing distributed ledger technology, we circumvent the current convoluted,  centralised global payment infrastructure, creating efficient and trustless networks.  The back-end code that powers the DApp runs autonomously on the decentralised network, rather than on centralised networks such as cloud hosting. The DApp builds on the core technology through Smart Contracts and User Interfaces in order to provide some utility.\n\n",

    "question": "Non-native English speaker here. \n\nI live in Bangladesh. I see on subs like \/r\/sweatystartup, where people earn an US middle class salary doing work such as pressure washing, deck staining, lawn care, tree removal and such. They seem to make very good money by US standards. People there say that they are earning more than someone with a Bachelor's or Masters degree. \n\nYet, here in Bangladesh, people who do these types of work or businesses are at the absolute bottom of the income ladder. They earn USD 1.50 per day or less. They are below the international absolute poverty line. \n\nI also don't see how productivity has anything to do with it. Its not a high tech occupation, where someone using more high technology would be more productive. Here the job and productivity is nearly the same. The same goes for the quality of the output. \n\nCan someone explain this phenomenon?",
    "answer": "1) *Other* industries are more productive. Therefore  you have to pay these individuals more to guarantee their labor supply, or else they will exit for jobs in industries which have become more productive across time. (i.e., in the long run, opportunity cost is a constraint on labor supply) This is [Baumol's cost disease](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baumol%27s_cost_disease).\n\n2) In the same way, if you're in a more productive industry, your time is valuable, and so your willingness to pay to outsource household labor is also higher, and so prices for those services will rise. (That is, productivity increases in some sectors may shift around labor *demand* in others)\n\nRising general productivity in the US relative to Bangladesh is going to cause wages of all individuals to rise."

This seems obvious to me but I’m not sure if there’s some hidden downside to that or if it’s just a political problem.\n\nEdit: lots of people saying that not everyone can do construction, which is fair. But I imagine there are lots of non-construction jobs that could be beneficial to do as well, like street cleaning or something.\n\nEdit 2: obviously high unemployment caused by coronavirus caused this question, but I’m asking in a general sense",
    "answer": "I think unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are commonly misunderstood.\n\n1. Unemployed people are not doing \"nothing\"; they're looking for work. Benefits expire after a said period of time. UI benefits are meant to smooth consumption while you're looking for a job.\n2. There's evidence that UI improves the quality of your search. People with benefits find jobs that they are better-qualified for, have higher wages, and\/or longer tenure. This is good for the labor market because it means the right people are being matched with the right job, and increases what we call \"match quality\".\n3. Human capital (like skills) are occupation specific i.e. people are good at what they do. There's a lot of research demonstrating that exogenous (as in random) occupation switches lead to long term loss in wage prospects and job quality. Forcing unemployed people to switch occupations\/ learn something unrelated to their field when they could be spending their time and resources into finding a good job would lead to overall loss in productivity.\n4. You only qualify for UI if you've been laid off due to no fault of your own. It could be the business was shutdown, there was a natural disaster, etc. It is unwarranted to ask these people to take up additional costs (which could be many and varied) to switch trades, even temporarily.\n\nHope that helps!"

    "question": "Lets say I have 25L in cash with me and I want to buy a house. There are 2 scenarios, I can buy it all cash or I can finance it at 6.5% interest.\n\n1. I buy it with Cash. I have a house from day 1.\n\n2. I make 20% down payment and take 20L home loan at 6.5% for 20 years, which makes EMI of 15k per month.\nNow I take the 20L cash and put it in Nifty Index and withdraw 15k per month from it.\n\nI have calculated the returns for it.\n\nIf Nifty performs bad for 20 years then lets say it gives 8% CAGR, and I withdraw 15k per month from it for EMI. I will be left with 7L in my portfolio after 20 years of paying the EMI.\n\nIf the market performs as per past and gives 13% CAGR and I withdraw 15k per month. I will be left with 78L in my portfolio after paying all the EMI.\n\nOverall I think this should be the way if I have cash and wants to buy the house. But it seems to good to be true. Am I missing something? Or this is a correction calculation?\n\nPlease share your thoughts.",
    "answer": "The calculations are a start, but you have made some implicit assumptions which may not be true. \n1. 6.5% housing loan you would get is most certainly a floating rate loan, so will not stay constant for next 20 years, given that the current interest rates are kept low due to Covid, the rate will inevitably go up in the future, might also cross the 8% pessimistinc estimate of Nifty return that you have. \n2. While Nifty may have 8~13% return rate when averaged over next 20 years, the individual years may have wildly varying returns... A series of negative return years, say -20%, -10%, -30% followed by some very good years might wreck your financial plan. You still will have to withdraw 15k per month to pay off your EMI. Sequence of returns is very important, more important than averaged returns over x years... \n\nCombine both scenarios and you are looking at more trouble. \n\nIf you look at investing part of the portfolio in some debt instrument for \"safety\"  then the averaged out return may not be enough to justify the time and  effort involved."

    "question": "i.e. What have economists discovered in the last 50 years?\n\nA lot has happened since the 1970s, like the two oil shocks, US stagflation, fall of the Soviet Union, 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nHas economics undergone any fundamental shifts over this period of time? Has there been any breakthroughs or major shifts of thought?",
    "answer": "Economics is *very* different than it was 50 years ago. Microeconomics, for instance, has undergone a drastic shift. Microeconomic theory in the 1970s was very much what you might call \"classical\" microeconomic theory- there was still a large focus on consumer and producer theory that underpins general equilibrium, and decision theory was still an active subfield. \n\nSince then, microeconomics evolved; many of the issues in decision theory were worked on and resolved (or at least resolved enough that economists figured further inquiry would be largely mathematical exercises of little real interest). Further, game theory rose to forefront of microeconomic theory and took over the field and has *almost* gotten to the point of exhausting it's traditional lines of inquiry (e.g. game theorists have moved away from a lot of traditional approaches to mechanism design to focus instead on more exotic approaches that yield \"worse case\" bounds or robust mechanisms; good examples of this would be the work of Bergemann or Brooks). Behavioral and Experimental economics (in many ways deeply related to microeconomic theory) became a field, and some of the results (such as Vernon Smith's stock market experiments with ASU undergrads) were deeply shocking to the field (among other things, this experiment exhibited evidence of bubbles arising even in relatively simple settings). \n\nEconometrics evolved as well. For one, in the most recent two or three decades, there's been an explosion of interest in causality on all levels. This means on a philosophical level, on an estimation level, on an implementation level, and in specific particularized applied problems. This has led to drastic advances in econometric methods, giving the applied researcher a very powerful toolbox as well as something of a guide to best practices in experimental implementation (thanks to the work of people like Duflo and Banerjee in doing so many experiments and learning the good practices the hard way). The combination of this interest in experiments, good guidelines, and strong tools for estimation has allowed us to answer questions we would have found impossible to answer before: what is the impact of UBI? Which aid programs to developing countries are most effective at increasing health outcomes? etc. Of course, as an econometrician, I find the theoretical advances that this has brought more interesting, but most people care less about that. Other things of note in econometrics are the rise and fall of a whole theoretical subfield, that of time series analysis (much like decision theory, there *was* a lot of productive work, but most of the questions have been exhausted). Whole nonparametric methods of estimation have come into style, gone out of style, and come back into style in the last 50 years- a good example would be neural networks, which actually saw pioneering work in the early 90s by an *econometrician* who would later go on to win the Nobel Prize for his many *other* contributions. \n\nFinally, macroeconomic theory is a very different beast than it was 50 years ago. Stagflation and the Lucas critique led to a drastic underlying shift in macroeconomic theory which pulled the field towards microfounded models beginning in the early 80s. While early microfounded models got a lot of well deserved flak, they eventually became an essential part of modern macroeconomic research, and in recent years, the most advanced of these models have become as good at forecasting as the traditional gold standard, VARs. Moving away from macroeconomic \"methods\" and more to macroeconomic \"facts\", many of the crises you mentioned have been taken in stride by macroeconomists in pursuit of understanding economic dynamics. There are certain macroeconomists who constantly emphasize the tightly related role that oil shocks seem to play in the business cycle (one prominent macroeconometrician in particular who emphasizes this that comes to mind is Jim Hamilton). The 2008 financial crisis spurred a whole host of literature on financial networks, systemic risk, and macroprudential policy; the low interest rate environment that results from the GFC spurred research into macroeconomic policy at the zero lower bound (when interest rates are nominally 0). The \"lost decade\" of Japan led to the now Nobel prize winning research of Ben Bernanke on interest rate targeting and forward guidance, research that would inform his actions during and after the GFC.\n\nAll this is to say that economics is a very large and very active field, and if you were a newly minted PhD student in 1972, there's a huge chance that much of what you learned as being the leading edge of economics would be seen as being so outdated as to not even justify inclusion (or inclusion to a significant degree) in the standard first year PhD sequence."

    "question": "I’m in a microeconomic class right now and I feel like all of this would be so much easier\/intuitive\/effective if we used calculus. Elasticity, marginal benefit, everything. There’s no way this can be used in the real world without calculus right?  Why isn’t the class taught with calculus in mind.",
    "answer": "It depends on the country and the university. In the US, Intro Micro is usually taught without calculus, but Intermediate usually is with calculus (but certainly not always). In some engineering focused universities in the US (e.g. MIT) and most European ones (from what I have heard), they use calculus in intro micro. \n\nI am in the US, and in my intro classes that don't require calculus I briefly go through the idea of taking the derivative of a total revenue function to get marginal revenue, so they can see where the \"twice the slope is demand is linear\" rule comes from.

Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.” "

    "answer": "Stopped drinking alcohol - mind you, this is better advice the older you get. In your 20's the social upside probably outweighs any of the downsides. As you approach 40 never being hungover is like a superpower compared to many of your peers. Never had a \"problem\" but you quickly realize how society has normalized willingly being sick once or twice a week once you actually stop."

    "question": "Probably a very stupid question and even more philosophical than economic, but are there theories or even proof that Supply and Demand is a law that applies to nature as well?",
    "answer": "What an interesting question! One way to look at the law of supply and demand is as a law about what the **optimal quantity** to be supplied based on the benefits to the supplier is. If the supplier produces more than that quantity, they will either have a surplus, meaning unnecessary costs, or reduced benefit, since it will have to discount the supply to get rid of all of it. If a supplier produces too little, they miss out on potential benefits.  \nFrom the perspective of the consumer, if they consume below the optimal quantity, they're missing out on a trade that would make them better off. If they over consume, they have spent more resources than they like.\n\nTo see how this might play out in nature, consider a flowering tree and a bee. The bees are consumers, using energy to fly from flower to flower (price) in order to consume nectar from the flowers. The tree is the supplier, using energy to produce flowers, and gaining the benefit of pollination from the bees (price). If the tree produces too many flowers, the bees will only visit the easiest ones, so there is a surplus. The law of supply and demand doesn't say that the tree will produce the right number of flowers, or that the bee will visit the right number, just that there is an equilibrium value."

    "question": "So, pardon my ignorance, but we are essentially borrowing $6 trillion from who exactly?  And what does that mean on top of what we already owe?\n\nThe further I look into this, it just seems like a shell game.  I mean, who the fuck borrows $28 trillion dollars, who is lending that, and who the hell is going to call out on that eventually?",
    "answer": "The US mostly finances it's debt via bonds. So they sell bonds to literally the highest bidder, and pay them back once they reach maturity.\n\nWho owns those bonds? Well, more or less anyone who wants can buy them, people, companies, foreign investors, etc.\n\nThat said, most of this debt is held by the American public.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124\n\nHow is it paid? Well, you have to keep in mind that this isn't one big loan, it's hundreds of thousands of bonds. It's not paid back all at once, either. The cost of the debt isn't really the 28 trillion, it's what it costs to service that debt.\n\nAnd it's paid by mostly tax dollars. Current tax dollars and future tax dollars. And especially with things like infrastructure investments, what matters is how much you get in return, meaning how much you invest into the economy and how much economic growth you get for that.\n\nIn that regard, the US has a pretty good track record. Because debt is generally cheap for the US, because it's literally the most reliable debtor there is, so rates are low, and because returns are good, leading to a cost that's ultimately the vast majority of the time either negative or slightly positive.\n\nhttps:\/\/fredblog.stlouisfed.org\/2018\/11\/how-expensive-is-it-to-service-the-national-debt\/"

    "question": "It's common sense personal finance advice to build enough of an emergency fund to last a few months, but clearly institutions don't act the same way because otherwise the Fed wouldn't be forced to intervene so heavily in the repo market. Is it fair to draw analogies between short-term liquidity facilities and payday\/title loans? Is the expectation of cheap institutional credit disincentivizing the long-term planning that we encourage from individuals, and does this cost the economy in the long run?",
    "answer": "It's important to remember the difference between liquidity and solvency. It's not that companies are at risk of going bankrupt due to bad managment, its a sudden demand shock thats hurting them. They just need cash to hold them over until things normalise.\n\nSo that leads to the question; why don't companies keep rainy day funds? \n\nNow a lot of people on reddit will start harping on about stock buy-backs and corperate evil and stuff like that, but it's actually a lot simpler. \n\nLeaving cash sitting around in a bank account waiting for a rainy day is a bad investment, like an awful investment. Say you run a cafe, any extra cash you have lying around can probably be invested back into you business, buy a better coffee machine, upgrade your kitchen, ect. Now for a cafe there's only so many things you can spend your money on, but for a massive international firm there are always ways to invest that money. And if you as a company don't have anything good to invest in then you can pay money to your shareholders and let them invest in new things. Money sitting in a bank account isn't doing anyone any good, if we did what some morons on latestagecapialism are suggesting and made companies have rainy day funds that would tie up billions (maybe even trillions) of dollars in the economy (and fuck with interest rates)."

    "question": "In the fine 1964 film Goldfinger, James Bond and the audience initially think the villain's plan is to steal the gold from Fort Knox. Bond even points out the madness of this idea by calculating how many trucks would be needed to haul it away.\n\nNot so fast, Goldfinger replies. The actual plan is to detonate a dirty bomb inside the vault, irradiating the gold. In Goldfinger's mind, this will essentially destroy its usefulness for many years, and his own legally-owned gold will increase in value because it's now a scarcer resource, making him an immense profit. Bond later tells Pussy Galore that the plan is insane.\n\nWhat would actually happen if a dirty bomb went off inside the Fort Knox gold depository? Would owners of non-radioactive gold make out like bandits? If the U.S. suddenly had some urgent need to trade away highly radioactive gold, could it just sell bullion inside lead boxes?",
    "answer": "So I'm not an economist, but I am a chemist. A dirty bomb works by scattering radioactive dust in the area of the explosion, so there's little bits of radioactive uranium causing the health hazard. It's possible to remove the dust, so after a thorough clean the gold would be fine. If the uranium caused some of the outermost layer of gold to become radioactive, it would form an isotope of gold, which would then undergo decay into regular gold and helium in a pretty short amount of time, seconds to days depending on the particular isotope formed."

This will in the long run hurt the production because of lack of talent and slow the economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?",
    "answer": "Absolutely, and for more reasons than just that:\n\n- When homeowners earn more from their house than their job, that job seems less worthy of their valuable time\n\n- When it's become more attractive to go into real estate than, say, engineering or entrepreneurship, you can expect fewer engineers and entrepreneurs, and those entrepreneurs that remain will be running startups in the real estate industry (ie, Key Living Corp)\n\n- And as long as the bubble continues, expect it to soak up more investment capital like a black hole, resulting in less investment available to productive endeavours or disruptive innovations\n\n- It will also get more expensive to run businesses, as more and more of your revenue gets allocated to the ground under your factory and the ground under your workers' beds\n\n- When it's more expensive to start a family, expect fewer children\n\n- If the bubble truly never pops, expect immigration to eventually slow down too, as Canada becomes more expensive and less attractive\n\n- And if it does pop, well, the picture might get a lot brighter, but only after a period of deep darkness as our mistakes catch up to us"

If this is the case, how has the purchasing power of the dollar not complete dissipated? Shouldn't the US dollar be worth more or less a fifth of what it was 3 years ago? Please make it make sense.**",

Notice the rather complex speil about \"Before May 2020\" and \"After May 2020\". Basically, in May 2020 the Fed decided to include savings accounts in M1 money supply. That caused a lot of unnecessary confusion and was a bad idea in my view.\n\nIf you look at M2 money supply you will see that that metric has risen by 40% since the COVID pandemic started. So, it is not surprising that we have high inflation. In recent months money supply has been falling slightly."

    "question": "Isn’t the stock market mostly an indicator of how well corporations are doing? If they are doing well than why is the stock market falling at unprecedented rates?",
    "answer": "Markets are forward looking. Investors and speculators see that things will be worse in the future. That affects corporate profits now.\n\nRemember that companies borrow a lot. They also often borrow at variable interest rates. As a result, their borrowing cost will rise significantly. Bank borrow and lend. In the US however, they usually lend at fixed interest rates for home loans. So, the mortgage payments banks are getting are falling in value due to inflation, but banks can't compensate by increasing interest rates.\n\nThen there's leverage. Many investors use leverage to obtain higher returns. Those loans are also variable rate. They have become sharply more expensive because of the Fed interest rate rises.\n\nLastly, there's bonds which are an alternative to shares. The rate rises have made bonds much more attractive. 15 year US government bonds yield nearly 4%. Compare that to the shares of a company that gives no growth, those may also yield 4%. So, why buy a share - which comes with risk - when you can buy the bond?"

I was blown away. Is it really that rare that you buy something at cost anymore?  I get it, if it's not financed what's the problem?  For me, the problem is shitty cash flow every month because you're tied up in monthly costs. And if your income changes, you're not done with those transactions, you owe on them for years (usually).

    "question": "How do I get one of these $150k per year jobs?\n\nI've been busting my ass for years for way less and feel lucky to make $80k.\n\nBut then I come here and everyone talks about earning hundreds of thousands per year like it's no big deal.\n\nI'm 33\/M with a master's degree, veteran. Live in MCOL USA. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong?",
    "answer": "Nah man, people making sub-100k aren't making posts because it's harder for them to humble brag about. Keep your costs reasonable, don't let lifestyle inflation kick in, invest religiously and let compound interest take care of the rest. You have a Master's, I'm sure you could move somewhere in search of a better salary if you chose to, but the point is you have *options*. Just stay the course."

    "question": "I'm sure I'll be downvoted to oblivion, but $180k is a very low tier to start taking half of earnings.\n\nThe $180k top bracket hasn't changed in over a decade. House prices, wages, cost of living has gone up substantially since '09.\n\nThe median salary has gone up 30% since '09, so we should see all tax brackets adjusted $235k should be the new top bracket.\n\nTo be clear, I'm no just advocating for the top bracket increase but when you're talking about 1\/2 being taken, it's no wonder we see so many trying to minimise tax through less productive ways (negative gearing\/trusts etc)\n\n(Yes, I get how progressive tax brackets work...)",
    "answer": "We tax labour too high imo, and capital gains, gift, and estate taxes are too low. Why do people working hard and earning well have to high taxes, while someone can inherit a 2 million dollar house and not pay a cent. It's kind of ridiculous."

    "question": "Would a group of new grads who just graduated from college with Bachelor's degrees in Economics do a fairly good job at running the Federal Reserve, or would they most likely lead the country to economic ruin given the amount of knowledge that their degree has taught them?\n\nLet's say this is their first job and they are tasked with running the Federal Reserve and creating U.S. federal economic policy. \n\nI'm curious as to what necessary on-the-job training in economics you all felt like you acquired that you did not learn in school that would be necessary in government positions like this.",
    "answer": "The Fed is supported by about 300 PhD economists. A PhD in economics is typically an additional five years of training beyond undergrad. Within the Fed, there are a bunch of more senior positions that are pretty much strictly for established economists (so at least ten years post PhD). A position as an economist at the Fed usually requires the accumulation of at least 15 years of bachelors training. Beyond that, the Fed employees a number of lawyers who ensure that the actions the Fed takes are legal and a number of bankers who I honestly don't know what they do, but presumably it's important. So it's not just the economics that the Fed requires, but all the legal and institutional knowledge as well.\n\nA lot of the difference is that a PhD is substantially more thorough and rigorous than an undergraduate degree. As for on the job training, maybe someone who is a mid career PhD economist can chime in.\n\nSo yes, it would be very bad for the economy if the Fed was run by people straight out of undergrad,"

    "question": "When the stock market crashed in 2000, it took 12 years for the S&amp;P index to recover all its losses for a **net gain of 0%**. \n\nHowever, the cash dividends from one's running balance in the S&amp;P index **grew by 80.5%** (not by 0%) from 1999 to 2012, growing at an annualized rate of 5.04%.

    "answer": "The crash in that period was entirely driven by runaway valuations and expectations about how the internet would revolutionize businesses. A company’s stock price doesn’t impact operations on a daily basis. It doesn’t matter to Apple if their stock trades at $50 or $500. They have enough cash and cash flow to continue business as usual. Most established companies operated the exact same way before and after the crash. The only thing that changed was their stock price. Since dividends are a function of how much cash the company can generate, dividends weren’t hit by the crash."

No, airlines can not operate by hoarding all their FCF in case another pandemic strikes. That’s not their job to prepare for. It’s the governments job to prepare for that and keep us and our businesses well informed and safe. \n\nThe airlines didn’t do some evil stuff here, and they aren’t evil companies.

    "question": "My friend is an economist who tries to stay updated with the latest economic news for his job. He mostly watches major news channels and tickers on TV.\n\nHowever, a lot of the media on major news networks is decidedly negative, sensational, biased, and not entirely accurate (usually by omission) and it is making him go insane. It is affecting his mental health, making him more afraid of our world, extremely depressed, and causing him to develop views that aren't accurately reflected in society. I really worry about him and wish he could be happier. \n\nThere has got to be a better way to get up-to-date economic information. Do y'all have any ideas?",
    "answer": "I was mostly in the IR world, but there are a lot of similarities in news cycles. Regardless, even the best newspapers have bias. Its important to be familiar with the subject, you will know when to apply salt accordingly. The NYT opinion section has Krugman and WP has wonks like Drezner. Both sections also have a ton of filler shit articles as well.\n\nEconomist: Probably more geopolitics than Economics ironically, but magazines-due to having to cover a wider period- often have longer articles and tend to be better researched. They often do reviews or talk about topics du jour that you can explore further: piketty appeared a bunch when Capital came out. \n\nPolicy Wonk sites: If you are familiar with the subject, you'll be able to detect someone's bias by their argument\/ who they cite. Some sites are more casual opinion, warontherocks and warisboring for Nat Sec. Others are focused on Industry news, such as Defense one. Use salt accordingly. I'm not as familiar with which ones are the economics equivalent. Try googling scholars you respect, they'll often post to these sites as well.\n\nThe actual source: If you are interested in legislation or enacted policy, bills are available online and the Federal Register is the official mouthpiece of all government organizations policy-wise. The Fed also has a ton of cool graphs\/info.\n\nFinally, the daily news cycle is oppressive in how much comes out a day. Rarely does one require minute-by-minute knowledge, since 24 news channels are just trying to fill up time on slow days. No one wants to watch \"boring day in NYC\". Clicks tend to be garnered from disasters that don't affect them, like miners trapped in cave in or \"disaster occurs in area we would never cover on a busy day\". A lot of signal is lost in the noise. Longer form journalism, even weekly magazines, tend to go more in depth and are better at identifying important aspects."

    "question": "A few assumptions:\n\n1. The gifts are made by elves who are paid nothing. \n\n2. The materials for the gifts are magically created, not purchased from a supplier.\n\n3. Every child in the world 0-16 gets $400 in gifts. I know that's totally unrealistic but so is Santa. \n\n4. The gifts cannot be returned or sold. \n\n5.

The real toy manufacturers don't get any royalties or anything, and demand for them does go down as the supply is flooded. \n\nThat would roughly be 1.925 billion people, a total of $770,000,000,000 worldwide being created in a very short period of time.

If the gifts *could* be returned for cash value, would the (greedy) kids be creating even more money?",
    "answer": "I think given the assumptions you propose santa-clause would actually cause deflation. Since the toy market would be injected with competition that is able to offer their product for free, it would likely cause a lot of downward pressure on prices overall, kind of like a technological shift in the market, where there is a significant increase in market entrents, causing the prices to go down, but this is an odd case because it's only one entrent causing the huge market shift."

    "question": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a 32 year old female teacher from Germany and live a very minimalistic lifestyle. My dream is to own a farm house in the south where the rivers and mountains are (very important!:)) and adopt at least one child, have my own animals and a growing business. I don't see myself in this conservative and humiliating teaching job for more than 5 years. \n\nRigh now I have 25.000€ and think about a 5 year plan, with 23.000 € savings for each year... Is anybody here who could help me out with financial advices? I am a german, wood work and history teacher and have no idea about finances or crypto etc.. And I know 100.000 € is peanuts for some.. I wish I could have started MUCH earlier but I had a terrible childhood and am  on my own and work and study since I'm 18. So many hardships I needed to  take care of first. Glad I don't have any debt for now.\n\nHave a nice day!",
    "answer": "* Firstly, do not seek or trust anyone on the internet that offers financial advise. **Always do your research.**\n\nSome ideas:\n\n* **Emergency fund**: Make sure to build an emergency fund to be able to cover emergency expenses. This fund should be able to cover 4-5 months of expenses in case something unexpected happens (e.g. broken car, emergency not-covered medical expense, hospitalisation of a family member abroad that might need financial support etc). After doing so, think what to do the rest money.\n* **Family**. You said you want to adopt a child. This is so amazing but you need to do your budjet estimation because a kid has a lot of expenses. might be a good idea to put some cash at the side for this goal if it is a short-term goal.\n* **Plan ahead**. Then, if you don’t have short term projects (e.g. buying a car, spending big on something, etc) that require cash, you can think about investing into stocks, ETFs etc. I understand that you have 25k saved already and **plan** to save in the next 5 years.\n* **Define an investing goal.** Depending on your goal and time horizon you can decide where to invest. What if you goal? To increase your capital in order to buy your home? VWCE is great for long term but if you seek short term gains then other assets or ETFs can be more appropriate.\n* **ETF choice**. Concerning ETFs, VWCE is a nice, not so risky ETF that contains stocks and many people including myself invest in it. And remember, always invest money that you don’t need in the short term. Also, justetf.com is great for ETF research.\n* **Broker**. As a broker, Degiro and IBKR are the most popular in Europe. I use degiro because of its low fees in nice ETFs like VWCE, IWDA, VUAA. Edit: people say below that in Germany there are also others. Do your research and find a low fee broker.\n* **Optimize taxes**. Concerning capital gain taxes I have no idea so speak with a financial advisor in Germany. Maybe an accumulating ETF is advantageous in your case. Or maybe not."

    "question": "Doesn't dedicating resources to building new houses when we already have many vacant houses a bad allocation of our land, labor and capital -- not to mention unnecessarily bad for the environment?",
    "answer": "Because the general idea is that where demand is is not the same place that supply is. There is a lot of demand for housing in urban areas, hence they tend to be significantly expensive.  But it’s the opposite effect in rural areas where there is low demand. So, by building more housing in urban areas we can shift the demand supply left so the end result is cheaper housing."

This is the lead-in to spring break when we're supposed to have packed flights.\n\nThe issue is we don't know how long this is going to last, and we don't know how severe the drop in demand will be.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that our CEO and a few other top-level executives have decided to take no salary for the next year."

    "question": "This question is inspired by Adam Something's video [City Review - Prague: Beautiful and Disappointing](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EnVvlhhqWtw)\n\nIn it, he repeats the common argument that a city centre became unaffordable to live in because people who intend to rent them out for Airbnb snap up all the properties and rent them out to tourists. But does that mean that tourism is the real driver of the unaffordability problem?\n\nIf so, why does Airbnb get the blame, and not other tourist infrastructure like hotels? Just like Airbnb, if land in a city centre is purchased to build a hotel on, it would increase demand for land and therefore increase prices.",
    "answer": "Hotels are more controlled than Airbnb. Depending on the city, you either need to buy land zoned for that purpose, or obtain specific permission to build a hotel, or both. Tourism will still compete with residential for land use, but it can’t compete freely, so cities have more tools manage the trade-off between tourism jobs and increased rents.\n\nAirbnb, by contrast, allows landlords to freely convert residential property into tourism accommodation (at least initially, some places have legislated to stop this), so they can arbitrage between tourism &amp; residential, which would cause a convergence in prices.\n\nThis does seem to be supported by empirical evidence - a number of studies have shown a link between volume of airbnb listings &amp; rising rents in particular neighbourhoods.\n\nhttps:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676909"

    "question": "So I’m having some guilt about evicting all the tenants of a property.\n\nI closing on a quad that I plan on BRRRRing. All 4 units need pretty severe rehabs. All 4 units are occupied. All 4 units are month to month.\n\nMy plan is to submit 30 day notice to vacate the day after closing. Take whomever to court that does not want to leave and start my rehab.\n\nI did think I’d have any issue doing this until now. As I ask my attorney to draft up the notices I’m feeling guilt for the first time in my real estate investing journey.\n\nI’ve done BRRRRs for multi families but they are typically been either empty or with delinquent tenants. \n\nThoughts?",
    "answer": "Probably wont be popular here but if you're feeling guilt maybe that's for a reason. You have people living in units that need \"severe rehabs\". They probably also recognize this and would've moved if they could afford to, so you will be kicking people out who likely have limited options. As others have said at least give more than 30 days notice.  I realize that you're making an investment but you should also ask yourself what you're even doing this for.  What is the point of a major reno vs. something more minor with a modest rent increase on current tenants? A comment on another thread in this sub recently called this strategy \"reprehensible\" and honestly I agree.  Housing is not a \"pure\" investment.  Obviously you expect to make money and that's fine, but real estate is different than other forms of investing.  It's not just an investment it's someone's home you are providing and if you don't want to deal with the realities of that maybe the money would be put to better use in the stock market."

    "question": "I'm a newbie to value investing and have been binging on Roaring Kitty's Youtube videos for the past couple of weeks. I see he takes into consideration a lot of factors to figure out if the company is undervalued or if the company won't go bankrupt (which I believe is his style of investing) .But how does he figure out the value of a stock. Say even if he's ballparking , what is that based on? I'm sure it can't be a simple straight forward formula where you plug in the numbers and outputs the value. If he says a particular company at this current price will be a 4-5 bagger, or sometimes he says \"I'd prefer this stock under 10$\"  how does he determine the value ?\n\n(p.s I'm a beginner so any article or books or tips y'all think would help me out in this learning process would be appreciated )",
    "answer": "What you're looking for is a ***relative baseline***.\n\nEverything in investing (much like life) is relative. What is it relative to? Everything else, of course.\n\nIs company A a better bargain than company B? Is company A less risk to my principal than company B?\n\nHoward Marks is fantastic for this (read his Oaktree memos).\n\nMost people use 10yr US Treasuries as a faux \"absolute baseline\", ie: the safest thing I can buy, often called \"riskless\". The 10 yr Treasury rate is currently about 1.6%.\n\nTo figure out from a P\/E perspective, we just flip the equation to E\/P, to get an earnings yield, which can be compared to a bond yield like a US Treasury. A P\/E of 10 is easy, 1\/10 = 10% yield.\n\nTypically, people apply a couple hundred basis points (fancy word for 1\/100th percent) to account for the risk between a stock and a bond, but of course it depends an awful lot on which stock or which bond.\n\nFor the riskless rate, let's apply 3.5% premium (350 basis points) to compare a treasury to a company we think is very safe). 1.6% 10yr Treasury + 3.5% premium gives us 5.1%. So the hurdle (rate which we must beat) for the stock to be a better deal than the treasury is a 5.1% yield. What is this in P\/E? Just invert. 100\/5.1 = P\/E 19.6\n\nNow you can decide things like \"Do I think interest rates (and treasury yields) will go up the next year or two? Maybe I want to give myself more room to account for this. Maybe I want to hunt stocks under 15 P\/E, or 10 P\/E, etc.\n\nThere's more nuance, but this is how intelligent people approach the process.\n\nDefinitely read Security Analysis, cover to cover, at least once."

There's also a lot of investors looking to gobble up prime real estate either to flip or keep as long term investment.\n\nLots of the frenzy is built  on a combination of factors mostly due to the low interest rate environment, pent up demand from year of COvID ,more workplaces offering more flexible wfh arrangements and increase in millennials ready to settle down. ..\n\nNo one knows if this is a bubble, because it's very different than 2008  , some regions could be in bubble territory depending on what happens when the moratoriums end, others could just be the new normal."

    "question": "I've heard from a lot of people that say day trading is a very risky career choice because most day traders lose money and it's not worth it. Why is this so, why do most day traders lose money and if \"most\" lose money then there are those \"some\" that are doing well. So what do those day traders do so well that they've capable of having successful day trading careers as opposed to the \"most\" day traders that fail?",
    "answer": "Risk management is the main differentiating factor. Due to human nature\/psychology and whatever you wanna call it, most just simply aren’t able to do it. Someone can 99 good trades with solid consistent profits, get greedy on the 100th one thinking they can 10x their money in a jiffy, and lose everything they had made in those first 99 trades in that one 100th trade. This sort of thing happens all the time and it can happen to anyone, no matter how well disciplined they think they are.\n\nThose who end up surviving are those who literally manage to ‘survive’ without losing their entire account for long enough (at least a couple of years at the earliest, if not more) while they navigate the learning curve and hopefully come out ahead. But it’s rare and most will either lose a substantial amount of money and give up and\/or decide that they would’ve actually made so much profit had they just bought and hold some good stocks and\/or index funds during all that time, and just go back to doing that (which is ultimately the safest most reliable way for anyone to make money in the market, buy index funds and\/or some solid blue chip stocks, keep contributing cash to the account as possible, and forget about the account for a few years).\n\nRight now, there’s tons of traders in the market who started trading after the March crash. Things have gone up since then in the most historic bull run in the market’s history. Someone essentially could’ve closed their eyes and pull some ticker names out of a hat and most likely they would’ve made money on them in the last few months. So there are traders out there who feel they’ve figured out the game and it’ll be smooth sailing from here. We see this type of posts all the time, like ‘check out my $500 to $5000 in last 3 months’ type of stuff. One semi-major speed bump in the market (which are inevitable from time to time) and most of these traders will be wiped out, and the cycle will begin again.\n\nThose who have been around longer always take the market with a healthy dose of skepticism and try to have their ducks in a row as much as possible, but that doesn’t mean they also aren’t susceptible to being wiped out if the perfect storm comes around.\n\nGood luck to all!"

Letters of intent, vaccine delivery contracts, and no reason to stop growing.  \n\n\nBut if we're going to talk about long term potential, it's not limited to delivery of packages either. DDC has **goodwill and trust** from regulatory bodies. There aren't many companies doing what they're doing, and no one knows how to regulate airspace. DDC now has a track record of doing it, and maintains their open cooperative relationship with Transport Canada and other regulatory bodies. So when other countries start thinking about how to safely integrate drones into their airspace, who will they come to?   \n\n\nFinally, in my opinion they should be nicely positioned to expand into other areas with the expertise they develop from operating the package delivery drones. Human transportation (air taxi) drones, and industrial inspection and maintenance are examples of adjacent industries that have great growth potential and not a lot of competition. DDC will have built expertise that can pave the way there. Point being, they're not going to be limited to delivering packages. Not sure if they'll just spin off another company if they decided to do that... they are called Drone Delivery after all. It's just my take on it. In for 2214 shares $1.16 avg."

    "answer": "Please do not listen to reddit on this kind of thing. People here ***wildly*** overestimate\/overvalue any sort skilled or semi-skilled trade pay. I think people on reddit have a fetish with \"manly\" careers, or at least are blissfully unaware of little most of them pay.\n\nFor example, the most highly rated comment in this thread claims you can make $100k driving a truck. The ***median pay*** for truck drivers is ***41k a year***, and the top 10% make ***$63k***. I'm sure someone makes $100k driving a truck, but its gotta be the top 0.1%.\n\nInevitably, when someone points out the data to debunk these wildly inflated salaries people on reddit throw out for trade skills, we get a lot of people commenting about how they know person X who is in a trade and makes a ton of money. That is called an ***argument by exception***. Medians and percentile rankings represent a large number of people. You can still know someone who makes $100k in a trade while the median is $40k. It is sort of like arguing that because Bill Gates dropped out of college and made billions, it is a good idea to drop out of college. \n\n***Edit 1:*** I am getting a lot of people responding to me trying to qualify their claims by saying that you have to move to make these huge dollar figures. The numbers I am looking at cover the entire United States, your local market may pay $60k+ for truck driving but that just means your market is on the right side of the income distribution. \n\n***Edit 2:*** I am also seeing a lot of people replying and claiming that these $100k figures are real, but only if you drive your own truck and work for yourself. The great thing is the BLS also has data on self-employed individuals in this profession.  Self employed individuals in the following occupations do ***not*** make much more than traditional employees: Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Drivers, Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers, and Industrial Truck and Tractor Operators.

There were varying degrees of legal market activity, such as collective farms being able to sell food they produced above their quotas. And we do know there can be differences between the official accounts and the day-to-day reality, for example while state-owned enterprises in the Soviet Union were officially centrally planned, they'd employ buyers to trade with other such enterprises to get their needed inputs.

    "answer": "It's NOT TRUE to say \"it's better to invest at market open than at market close.\" The red line on your graph shows that during daytime trading, prices have essentially averaged out to flat (0%). That means if you bought in the morning, you would do just as well as if you bought at close, as long as you're not selling your whole portfolio EVERY NIGHT and re-buying it every morning. In other words, someone who buys in the morning and holds gets to enjoy the overnight growth just as much as someone who bought right before close. So, you don't get any advantage by placing orders at the end of the day instead of the beginning.\n\nAlso, while this statistic is surprising, it's not as crazy as it sounds. There are only 6.5 trading hours per business day. Adjusting for holidays, there are 253 trading days per year, so 1644 trading hours. There are 8760 total hours in a year, so only 19% of total time is during trading hours. Thus, we'd expect 80% of the gains would happen outside trading hours anyway.

    "answer": "A key (and misleading) assumption in that assertion is its implicit assumption that minimum wage ought track along with productivity; if that's the only basis, it would be about $24 or so I guess. In years past this was previously regarded as being appropriate by some economic thinkers like Marx, but is not widely believed by modern economists today.\n\nAn alternate method of calculation might be to take the [federal minimum wage for 1968](https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/agencies\/whd\/minimum-wage\/history\/chart) ($1.60) and adjust purely for inflation using something like the [Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/data\/inflation_calculator.htm), which would indicate that it should be about $12.27.  In this sense, the Politifact checker cited is pretty much on track.\n\nThis gets problematic though, since it doesn't take into account whether $12.27 would really be sufficient to provide a comparable relative standard of living in the current era, when things like housing, cars, and healthcare are much more expensive if for no other reason than they're much safer and more advanced now. Something like broadband internet access would have been a fantastically unimaginable luxury in 1968, but now is often considered essential or nearly so. In this sense, just pegging wages to any one metric might not be answering the wider social questions well enough.\n\nAnother popular method of selecting minimum wage target is 150% of the [federal poverty level](https:\/\/aspe.hhs.gov\/poverty-guidelines) for a family of 4; the idea being that any person working full-time ought to be able to provide such a standard of living to her\/his family at a minimum. In 2021 for the lower 48 this would amount to $39,750\/yr, or about $19.40\/hr assuming 51 weeks\/yr and 40 hrs\/week. And while this method might seem intuitive, it is not without criticisms, if for no other reason than this 150% target is arbitrarily selected and based on a multiple of a figure that is almost as arbitrarily selected.\n\nREN has a pretty nice [FAQ about minimum wage](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_minwage) that you might look over too.\n\nEdit 1: wrong year for comparison, sorry for confusion\n\nEdit 2: added 150% poverty target, some other cleanup"

    "answer": "So [this Bloomberg article](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/features\/2015-mcdonalds-franchises\/) has a [table](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZoLFd0w.jpg) that breaks down the finances for McDonald's franchises in the US (credit to \/u\/uptons_bjs for finding it). Based on this table, we can try and estimate the price\/quantity change needed to support higher wages in the US. Specifically, let's see what needs to happen in order to keep the profit quantity constant. \n\n\n**Case 1: Growing Sales**\n\nSuppose that McDonalds was able to grow net sales by keeping prices constant. Furthermore, suppose that the composition of new sales was such that the composition of increased expenses did not change. In other words, assume that sales growing by 10% caused all other expenses to grow by the same amount. We don't have enough data to figure out what to assume otherwise, hence this is the simplest assumption. But, this will *overestimate* the quantity growth required to raise profit. \n\n[This table](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CiXSUJ5.png) shows the necessary growth in sales in order to compensate for a 100% increase in payroll expenses. Basically, if net sales and the cost of goods go up by 77.5% along with other expenses, we can hit about the same level of total operating income as before. \n\n\n**Case 2: Raising Prices**\n\nThis time, suppose McDonalds just raised prices. We will also assume complete inelasticity of demand (very wrong assumption!). We don't have enough data to figure out the true elasticity, so this is a generous assumption. Then, a Y% increase in prices will increase net sales by Y%, since we're assuming quantity sold doesn't change. At the same time, we can assume that all other costs and expenses are constant, since quantity sold is constant. \n\n\nHere's [the table](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/mbPC28O.png) but it now also shows how much of a price increase we need to compensate for a 100% increase in payroll expenses. As you can see, it's 37.5% which is a lot less than the quantity increase needed. \n\n\n**Case 3: Both**\n\nThere's multiple possible solutions here. Note that a 10% sales growth and 10% price growth will raise net sales by 1.1^2 = 1.21. So, the math is a little bit different from before. However, we are again assuming inelastic prices and that quantity growth causes an equivalent percentage change in each row. \n\nThe last part of [this table](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9iF9yR1.png) shows that 15% price growth and 12% sales growth is enough to ensure profit stays the same. \n\n----\n\nSo, basically, with  a moderate increase in price and sales, US franchises could face double the payroll expenses without losing much operating income. \n\nBut, take this all with a big grain of salt, because I've made some major simplifying assumptions to do the math here."

    "question": "There are times when we all might feel that we could be doing better, achieving higher and higher gains. I’ve set my weekly profit goal at $600. If I can do that consistently, it’ll be like working a 2nd job while hardly working at all. The wheel has enabled me to do that for the most part. Thanks Theta Gang. Good luck out there",

    "question": "I'm not involved in real estate much, but I can't help but think that heavily over-paying on a property (which, granted, is a long-term investment) seems a bit crazy on the surface to me.\n\nMany are paying cash, waiving appraisals\/inspections etc just to get to the top of a list for property listed 48 hours ago. I'm in the US, and I'm a bit familiar with how much foreign investors are at play.\n\nIs this just a potential recipe for another major bust, or is there more to this story than I understand?",
    "answer": "I wouldn't speak to much to the macro effects but I work in real estate so I'll lay out a few concepts. Sorry I'm on mobile. \n\nThe prices are high right now for at least three reasons. The lowering of interest rates means people can spend more and keep the same monthly payment they would have 2 years ago. Sellers have seen this and began raising prices last year as more people were shopping for homes then previously.\n\nBuilding materials have gone up in cost across the nation. From my understanding this is partly due to the forest fires in California, and partly due to covid restrictions on staffing at lumber mills. I believe tariffs have also had an effect. This has led to showing production. I've known a few builders that have just stopped production entirely last year.\n\nMore jobs going online and work from home have given people the freedom to live further away from their work and to live where they've wanted to move. This includes people from HCOL areas moving to cheaper markets and beyond and to offer cash on top of what a bank would be able to loan on a property. \n\nThis has all compounded to a lack of supply on a national scale. Some states have been hit worse then others.\n\nOur system of typical home loans requiring appraisals has at least slowed down the raise in pricing, but hasn't stopped the people with extra resources from offering over the appraised value. Appraiser's can only use comparable past sales to bracket appraised value with similar homes. As more homes are sold for inflated values, this become less of a hindrance on the values appraisers can reach.\n\nCommon perception in my corner of the real estate corner is that values will lower as interest rates raise. The speed for both would depend on the federal reserve. Im personally not sure how much they'll lower, since production is in no way close to making up for the lack of supply. Even when production rates were at full capacity two years ago, some markets still had signs of lack of supply, so I'm not sure how they would catch up. \n\nHow many jobs will continue to support remote workers? When will building material production raise enough to lower supply cost? Will we struggle with finding labor for the needed housing supply? Will interest rates raise too sharply force home values to crash? Stay tuned for the next episode"

You can travel ANYWHERE in any style. You can buy pretty much anything that normal people think of as 'rich people stuff'\n* **$100mm-$1billion:** I know its a wide range, but life doesn't change much when you go from being worth $200mm-$900mm. At this point, you have a private jet, multiple residences with staff, elite cars at each residence, if its your thing, you can socialize with movie stars\/politicians\/rock stars\/corporate elite\/aristocracy.\n* **$1billion:** I am going to exclude the $10b+ crowd, because they live a head-of-state life.

    "answer": "You're not wrong, but I think a direct correlation to Bitcoin is unwise. Not even considering total supply, remember that Bitcoin has years in development. To call it an unusable coin is just wrong, it is a gateway key (much like eth) for alts, and had real-world usability on sites such as silk road. That being said I have 0 btc, and hold around 70% of my stake in eth. It is far superior and could definitely take over btc as the face of crypto but it'll take some time. The fact that we still compare it towards btc means that btc is still the poster child of the cypto market.\n\nEdit: Also Bitcoin has much more use in Asian countries, just because adoption hasn't happened globally doesn't mean it's non existent."

    "question": "All jokes aside, have economists provided a \"smart\" and **just** way to tax rich individuals ?\n\nMedia is talking about taxing rich billionaires, but most of them have their wealth in stocks. Say you tax them when their wealth increases (i.e stock goes up) if you don't give them tax credits when their stock goes down, this would lack any form of justice.",
    "answer": "There's a lot of debate over optimal taxation, how to reduce inequality, etc. A 2011 [paper](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/jep.25.4.165) in the *Journal of Economic Perspectives,* authored by Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez, makes this series of recommendations:\n\n&gt;First, very high earners should be subject to high and rising marginal tax rates on earnings. Second, low-income families should be encouraged to work with earnings subsidies, which should then be phased-out with high implicit marginal tax rates. Third, capital income should be taxed.\n\nWhere exactly the top marginal rate should be set is a matter of dispute. A 2014 [paper](https:\/\/eml.berkeley.edu\/~saez\/piketty-saez-stantchevaAEJ14.pdf) in the *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy,* authored by Piketty, Saez, and  Stantcheva, recommends a top rate of 71%, while Christina and David Romer from UC Berkeley have [recommended](http:\/\/ceg.berkeley.edu\/research_117_2123314150.pdf) a top rate of over 80%. \n\nIn addition, we have to think about taxing wealth. In a [paper](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/bpea-articles\/progressive-wealth-taxation\/) for the Brookings Institution, Saez and Zucman (both from UC Berkeley) talk about the best way to implement a wealth tax in the US, which could potentially raise a great deal of revenue and substantially reduce inequality. Of course, we then have to deal with issues like avoidance, which has been an issue with previous wealth taxes in other countries.\n\nAs for the question of justice, that's more of a moral and philosophical question than an economic one. Many people see reducing inequality as more just, and so would advocate those policies. You may advocate different ones."

Until they do, don't reward companies with your loyalty. When you're worth more on the open market than your company will give you, they are doing you a disservice and you should make the best decision for your own future and go make what you're worth. The more people who do this, the more likely companies will be to change and allow us to stick around and be compensated for it.\n\nMillenials often started their careers in the recession, and have an inset fear of the job market because of it. They often walk around moping as if the economy is stuck in 2009, and it's not. The market is good right now, go test it.",
    "answer": "I think this is true. I recently changed jobs from a job I was at for over four years and got a 20% raise. Companies, in my experience, don't care about employee retention. They just want you for as long as you will accept what they pay you and are happy to hire and train a replacement.   \n\nWow thank you for this gold! I was just about to quit Reddit but this is the retention bonus I needed to stay! Thank you!"

    "question": "My wife and I have been on food stamps and Medicaid for over seven years. SNAP has been a lifesaver. It's not a perfect system, and there are hoops to jump through, but it has kept us fed when we would otherwise not have been able to feed ourselves.\n\nThen suddenly, last month, my wife needed major abdominal surgery to remove some tumors. We'd gone to the doctor a few times over the years, but we had never put our Medicaid coverage to the test. I have to say, the care she received was top drawer, the surgeon was amazing (the surgery was partially robotic!), and, best of all, we never saw a bill of any kind from the hospital and never made a single co-payment. \n\nSo, to everyone who pays the taxes that make Medicaid possible, thank you! The next time you hem and haw about paying taxes because you imagine your money being wasted on unnecessary government spending, remember that there are ordinary folks out here who greatly benefit from those same dollars.",

    "question": "Thinking about human nature, I feel it is reasonable to assume some companies will take the news about inflation and use it to raise prices higher than actually needed, but blame inflation. How difficult is it to study financial statements and try to determine if they need to raise prices as much as they are? I know this is a fairly broad question, but I am hoping to get some insights. Thank you!",
    "answer": "Not very easily.\n\nWhat does it mean to raise prices higher than \"needed\"?\n\nIf you just assume \"inflation\" is rising costs of inputs, it's relatively straightforward, given the data. Let's assume a company wants 2% profit, you just look at all the inputs, factor in the profit, and then you land at the \"correct\" price.\n\nBut that's not really how any of this works, or at best half of it.\n\nInflation happens primarily for two reasons, lower supply, or higher demand. Everything else being equal, higher demand means higher prices. That's just as \"valid\" as higher producer prices leading to higher consumer prices, and you can't figure that out from plain financial statements."

Any accidental violation of this term will be tantamount to fraud, and the lender may initiate legal proceedings against you.\n\nIt's unclear if they will actually enforce this, but it does seem risky to take a loan knowing that even accidental deletion will be considered fraud.

No. But it pays the bill.\n\nEdit - we also used to collect data on contact and most used contact so we can ping them in case of default.

Meanwhile these same companies have spend 80-98% of their free cash buying back their own company stock over the last 10 years. American Airlines alone has spent $12.5bn to buy back stocks. This of course is done to reduce overall divident costs and increase the share price. \n\nOn top of that, under the new US corporate tax code all of these companies have lowered their tax bills by billions of dollars.

    "answer": "I think I tend to agree with you! The only issue is that many employees would be hurt by this, and commerce throughout the country would be slowed without air travel for the near future. This is why others might not share your sentiment. \n\nDepending on the nature of this “bailout” I could see why it’s justified. If the airlines will pay the sum back to the federal govt with interest I don’t necessarily see the problem. Airlines operate on razor thin profit margins as it is. It’s an industry that is particularly vulnerable to crisis like this, despite an airlines best effort to prepare.\n\nThere is something to be said about moral hazard though. If industry expects to be bailed out when a crisis hits, why should they save money to weather crisis on their own?\n\nA potential solution would be for them to take the bailout to pay salaries, and then shut down and cut costs to be as low possible until the demand for travel comes back."

I lived in Beijing for nearly a decade, and the ignorance about China that I see from investors with positions in Chinese companies (or the closest thing you can get to such) is a bit shocking. Firstly, as a foreigner, you aren’t meant to have access to Chinese markets. They aren’t open to you, so all of the companies that you can buy into have gone against official directives and party narratives to open holding companies overseas in order to get some foreign money into the game. This doesn’t bode well for any of those companies. China seems like a capitalist, even a hypercapitalist country, but they aren’t. The central party is the arbiter of power. They maintain absolute control, and capitalist reforms are merely a tool for them to serve sociopolitical ends (development)."

    "question": "This might be a silly question lol. Manhattan rent average is at an all time high at $5,000\/mo but we’re also seeing crazy high rents in the middle of nowhere too (at least for where those cities are located). \n\nWill rents go down? Where will the working class go if rent continues to rise?",
    "answer": "In the long run, the cost of housing will be determined by the marginal cost of building it. Unfortunately, [local land-use regulations](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dataisbeautiful\/comments\/g4bdb0\/comment\/fnwed99\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) are driving up production costs and\/or preventing the construction of more affordable units. Over the long run, this is responsible for the increases we have seen in the cost of housing.\n\nSo what could happen as housing costs continue to increase? Well, a few things. Over time, the housing units we built have become nicer—larger square footage, more features (like A\/C), etc. We could see an increase in more basic homes that cost a little less. However, as long as land-use regulations remain prevalent, the effect on the price of housing is likely to be limited.\n\nBut more broadly, we could see faster growth in the cities that have more relaxed regulations that allow the housing supply to expand. The increase in remote work could help facilitate this trend.\n\nWe could also see municipalities ease up land-use regulations to some degree, and there are a few places this appears to be happening already. This is likely more of a political science question though."

    "question": "Here I am not thinking about developers but landlords who buy property to rent out. Considering that they did not design, build, plumb, or contribute in any other way to the development of the housing, are these people not extracting wealth without creating any?",
    "answer": "Separating property managers from landlords because I think it's pretty clear what value a property manager brings -- somebody has to fix the pipes, repair the AC, make sure the building passes fire inspection etc. These are all things that I as a tenant am paying money specifically so I do not have to think about them and were I a homeowner I would have to bother with them.\n\nThere are also obvious reasons why renting is good for an economy; taking myself as an example, I'm at a stage in my life where I'm moving a lot and if I couldn't rent I would be forced to buy and sell a house every time I wanted to move, which is obviously suboptimal for a lot of reasons.\n\nBut tackling the question of \"why private landlords\", the usual normative justification is that someone has to take on the risk of owning property. As a renter, if there's some property damage -- let's say a fire -- I can just move, but the landlord faces a much larger monetary loss. The landlord would likely be insured for that, but they wouldn't be insured for the pipes bursting or the AC failing, etc. So clearly there's risk in operating a rental unit and people need to be compensated for that risk in order for them to take the risk. And taking on this risk creates value. I've no interest in defending the many shitty landlords, but that's the general argument. \n\nBut why private landlords as opposed to the government? Basically the same justification for why use markets and not to centrally plan things; it's really hard for a government to figure out where to build housing, how much to charge for it, etc (not withstanding that transitioning from private to public ownership is challenging). There are successful housing regimes with substantial government involvement ([the city of Vienna owns and operates about 25% of Vienna's housing stock](https:\/\/www.huduser.gov\/portal\/pdredge\/pdr_edge_featd_article_011314.html), and this has had generally good outcomes for Austrian citizens), but there's a big jump from 25% to 100% of housing been owned and planned by the government."

{
    "question": "I may be wrong about this, but why does it seem like there is a conflict of interest between what's best for individual finance vs the economy? For example, it's best for a person to live frugally and use the most money to invest (education, health, retirement, etc.); whereas, it's better for the economy if everybody spends all of their money on not just essential but also luxurious goods. A society where people save more than they spend is a deflationary one. Likewise, a society where people invest more than they spend would probably cause a market bubble since more people buying a company's stock than it's product just drives its PE ratio through the roof\n\nAnother example is having kids is expensive. It's best for a poor couple to not have kids or only one if they want to get out of poverty as fast as possible. However, in economics, every couple should have 2 kids to sustain the future workforce and consumer spending.",
    "answer": "The general idea that individual household prudence can be bad for the economy is absolutely correct - this is called the Paradox of Thrift, and while it was heavily popularised by Keynes (1936), it's been part of mainstream economics for a long time. Keynes himself notes that Adam Smith (1776) refers to it in The Wealth of Nations, saying \"*What is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great Kingdom*\", and John M. Robertson (1892) wrote a whole book called the Fallacy of Saving, saying \"*Had the whole population been alike bent on saving, the total saved would positively have been much less... industrial paralysis would have been reached sooner or oftener, profits would be less, interest much lower, and earnings smaller and more precarious. This ... is no idle paradox, but the strictest economic truth*.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe formalised version is essentially a prisoner's dilemma. There is some intertemporal balance of savings and consumption in each period which is optimal for the economy, and another one which is optimal for the individual. There is no requirement that the two are the same. Some economists bicker over how different they are, for example there are those who argue that savings represent investments and are also conducive to growth; which is not wrong, but from an intertemporal optimisation point of view, investment returns come with significant lag, so they are not optimal in each period. Consequently, no one really disputes that it would take a dramatic coincidence for the individual and collective optimums to be exactly the same even in one period for one individual, let alone in every period for every individual. This is made even worse in a recession, where greater economic uncertainty motivates higher precautionary savings, but higher savings would sink the economy into a larger hole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the specific examples you choose to highlight though... some are more relevant than others. Overvaluation of the stock market isn't necessarily related to overinvestment, but rather inefficient allocation of investments. If the total value of investments increases dramatically, but the threshold for required returns remains the same, then there's really no change in valuations; instead, capital flows to underinvested companies, or to new opportunities. If there are no new opportunities but investment inflow continues to enter the market, that's not a problem in itself either, all it does is lower the expected market return and hence valuations continue to remain fair.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are actually a bunch more economic paradoxes; most kicking in when the economy is in a recession or otherwise impaired. The paradox of toil argues that an increase in willingness to work can have the effect of lowering wages, but if nominal interest rates are at a zero lower bound then total demand falls instead since people have lower spending power and no further available credit, workers just spend less and the economy shrinks. The paradox of flexibility argues a similar angle, but points to low wage stickiness (perhaps from having good-natured and understanding workers) making it easier for wages to fall, also causing the economy to shrink. The paradox of deleveraging focuses on banks, who when faced with economic recession, tend to reduce the risk on their balance sheet; but in so doing, tighten credit and magnify distress to the economy."

    "question": "Right now, the trends and data indicate that Depression-level economic fallout from the covid-19 pandemic is a real possibility. The last time we saw a pandemic of this level was the Spanish flu in 1918-1919. But why did the influenza back then not devastate the economy like we are seeing now? Cities implemented social distancing nearly 100 years ago as well. So why did this not result in 20%+ unemployment rate and cratering of stocks?",
    "answer": "The economy looked very different in 1918. Our modern economy has a much larger share of consumer driven activity, which is directly impacted by social distancing. 1918 had not yet mechanized nearly as much, farming was a much larger share of the economy, where social distancing has less impact on productivity."

Thailand is almost always referred to as upper middle income and it's GDP per capita is  only 7,233. So why is it that Cuba is almost always referred to as a poor country? How are the GDP figures for Cuba computed? Is there manipulation of data? Is it harder to compute their actual GDP because of their economic system? Is there anything I'm missing that would indicate that it's actually a poor country and not an upper middle income one?",
    "answer": "&gt;why is it that Cuba is almost always referred to as a poor country?\n\nThis is a media\/politics question, not an economics question. \n\nIf you look at world bank categorizations(and other similar institutions),  Cuba is generally qualified as varying degrees of middle income (depending on the year)."

    "question": "This is one of those questions that ive always been afraid to ask because I feel stupid for not knowing \/ understanding the answer, but it came up in my mind as I was listening to a lecture from Mankiw. \n\nIn that lecture, he said that expanding education would decrease inequality because most of the US' inequality increase from the 70s onward was due to Skill-Biased Technological Change, since technology significantly benefited those with high skills, while those with low skills were more or less left out.\n\nThis makes sense, and I can definitely see why giving low-skilled workers more skills would decrease inequality (as it could help them capture the gains of technology)\n\nbut dont we need low-skilled workers, like in services, for instance? Dont we need taco bell workers, janitors, etc.? If everyone had a college degree or more, who would be \/ who would wanna work in these jobs?",
    "answer": "In the short run there could be a shortage of low skilled workers, but then wages rise to compensate for the low supply. \n\nMore people in higher skilled work may decide they would prefer to work in a lower skilled profession if it means they could earn the same amount or slightly lower without the stress that can come with a more demanding profession. \n\nAdditionally less people may be inclined to take up further education pursuing a more skilled profession if low skilled work wages rise. Same goes for those already in low skilled professions (leaving low skilled work in pursuit of higher skilled work) \n\nThere’ll also be higher immigration into countries that see a rise in wages for low skilled work where their home countries have lower wages, improving the trade off of moving abroad for work to send funds back home."

You are not legally required to give notice, and if the company does not give the courtesy of letting employees finish out their 2 weeks they don't deserve the courtesy of 2 weeks notice.\n\nEdit: To clarify generally speaking you should give two weeks notice, but it is not required, and there are situations that you should not.

    "answer": "User civgarth who used to be a trader, had a good story:\n\n&gt; You will always win in the long term if you just buy the broad market because it's designed to win. \n\n&gt; That said, if you're all in with the money you need tomorrow and you're riding out a correction, then that's on you.\n\n&gt; Prices are by definition, 'manipulated' because traders make money on price action in **both** directions. \n\n&gt; A trader's job is to force the highest possible trade before changing direction, hoping to create bagholders and then generate sentiment in the opposite direction to buy back at a lower price. \n\n&gt; That's what they are paid to do. Algorithms are constantly learning herd behavior so they can trade ahead of it.\n\n&gt; Investment funds exist to aggregate user money to make bets on the collective results of the world's traders, who are now mostly lines of code coded by mathematicians and statisticians. They trade on inside information and they all front-run the herd with misleading information or selective omission. As the investing public, we've all agreed that it's ok for them to cheat because they are cheating on our behalf in the form of investment savings, and pensions. We just ride the whale. For non-institutional traders like myself, we don't trade with a particular ideology. We just follow the whale. \n\n&gt; The funds are not 'smart' money as the media often claim. They are huge pools of money and their moves create their own gravity which affects the algos they own and benefit from. \n\n&gt; I apologize. They are 'smart' in the sense that they will always have information ahead of the rest of us.\n\n&gt; I would hope that the few actively traded funds who display their trades each day have demonstrated they are not particularly 'better' at this than you. They just have more money and can keep buying the dips or calling the top until it actually happens. As I said in another post, you're not necessarily worst than someone else, you just don't have a big enough account to offset your mistakes as they do theirs.\n\n&gt; The market will always go up because if it didn't, these folks would not be able to attract investor money. Over the decades, the market has collectively decided 7% - 12% is a good return because it's enough to attract new money into the hands of money managers and yet not high enough to discourage randos to try to beat it on their own - thus maintaining the illusion of a market. The price is the last trade, whether 100 shares or 1,000.\n\n&gt; You will always win in the long term if you just buy the broad market because it's designed to win. That said, if you're all in with the money you need tomorrow and you're riding out a correction, then that's on you.\n\n&gt; Source: Worked as a derivatives trader in the late 90s but computers do the job much better now. I trade with 10% of my account while the other 90% is just stuff I never sell and only add to."

    "question": "Every article I read paints the picture that the housing market dropping 20% will be a disaster for the country but for low income earners like myself I might be able to actually afford something decent in a short while. During the pandemic prices were moving up so fast I thought it was over for me and the media was celebrating this. I guess im supposed to feel guilty that I may not be priced out of owning home? \n\nThere’s all this talk about addressing housing affordability but when it actually starts to happen people scream the sky is falling. I don’t get it. Do people earning less than 100k per year even have a goddamn voice in this country?",
    "answer": "Part of the reason for all the negativity is the wealth effect being hit when house prices drop. People who may have no intention or interest in selling love to hear their house appreciated by $100K or so. Some may use that to refinance, draw down on equity to pay for an IP or buy a new car, or go on an overseas trip.\n\nSo when they hear their house has dropped in value by $100K, they feel poorer. Now, to go on that trip to Bali or Bermuda, they may not have enough equity to draw down. So they either have to save (many may not be doing that actively so it feels hard), or they have to pull back on their expectations- the new Porsche Cayenne will have to wait, so the old Pajero will have to keep going for a few more years.\n\nSo even though people may not be looking to sell, their lives are impacted because their options for increased consumption have been pared back.\n\nBesides, we have a culture where home ownership is worshipped and some of the media networks have ownership in the real estate portals."

    "answer": "Here's the math. \n\nThe term cap rate refers to the net operating income divided by the price of the property. \n\nNet operating income ignores any mortgage, as that cost can fluctuate greatly based on how big of a loan is taken out. The cap rate is essentially the return you would achieve if you bought the property outright without a mortgage. I'll explain why you wouldnt do that. \n\nIn today's market where values are high cap rates are lower, but typically still higher than the cost of a mortgage.\n\nLet's use 8% cap rate (return) for example as that's around where I bought my last property.\n\n Let's see how leverage enhances those returns with a fictional example of a 100K property where we put 20K down and borrow 80K @ a 4% interest rate. \n\nA 100k property with an 8% cap rate will return 8k in NOI annually, and the interest on the loan will cost $3,200, for a net income of $4,800\n\nA $4,800 net income on a 20k investment is a 24% leveraged return in your first year. If rent income increases or property value increases, so does you return. \n\nAnd that's how leverage takes an investment which produces an 8% return and turns it into a 24% return. \n\nUS Real Estste allows you to apply a lot of leverage in a way that's not overly risky (dont get me wrong, more leverage always means more risk).\n\nDid I succeed in ELI5?

I think the simplest answer is that policy is not set by economists, it's set by politicians and the voters that elect them. In *many* instances, politicians enact policies that most economists would advise against.\n\nIt's likely worth noting that while rent control is negative in aggregate, it can produce some winners in the process. Particularly, if you're a resident in a rent-controlled apartment, the policy may benefit you even if it's at the expense of many others. So it's entirely possible that the beneficiaries (who are current residents) may be a powerful voting group."

    "question": "He will get on top of SCHD dividend income, US social security.  \nHe doesn't have a work pension or an IRA withdrawal,  because he immigrated to USA 15 years ago and put all his money towards buying a house.\n\nHe will have to sell his home and rent an apartment.

    "answer": "State-owned enterprises tend to be less profitable than private enterprises (due a variety of factors, such as their habit of over-employing workers). However, their impact on overall economic growth is more ambiguous. One [study](https:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/mcb\/006\/1995\/00000022\/00000003\/art00002) looked at public enterprises in the OECD, finding that \"the evidence fails to support the hypothesis of a negative relationship between [public enterprises] and economic growth.\"\n\nSimilarly, a more recent [study](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1898677) looked at SOEs in China, and found that while they are less profitable, they also generate positive spillover effects that benefit the overall economy. To quote:\n\n&gt; Since these two effects offset each other, the contribution of SOEs to economic growth in China during our sample time frame was not significantly different from that of non-state enterprises.\n\nThere is also some evidence that SOEs can [improve health](https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0020731419833530) and [reduce inequality](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1062940818303681), while privatization is associated with [lower wages](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3278753#:~:text=Following%20privatization%2C%20wages%20for%20incumbent,to%20within-establishment%20wage%20changes.) (an effect which spills over throughout the labor market). One [meta-analysis](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/apce.12092?casa_token=L-2VjCbz21MAAAAA%3Aj6AElLw46DgBTn3bd3Ld2LGxvdwGPmg2e53zOSD4rSsPvjxOxoG_rdLokLoz2NfocsXZ_K6ONaPvgQHn9Q) from 2015 found that, when these other factors (such as social externalities) are taken into account, \"there is no support for the claim that private enterprises have better performance ceteris paribus than public enterprises.\"\n\nAs such, determining whether they are \"bad for the economy\" is a bit more ambiguous than the issue of mere profitability; there are other factors to take into account. Applying market logic and competition to them will likely improve their overall profitability, however. Competition does tend to spur greater efficiency, as a general rule."

    "question": "https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supply_and_demand#Criticism\n\nBasically, there's two arguments here:\n\n1. Supply and demand is a tautology, or the existence of it is unfalsifiable. The labor theory of value is a better way to set prices.\n2. Supply and demand doesn't apply to modern goods, since stores set prices using a fixed markup percentage over their costs. \n\nI thought supply and demand was a cornerstone of economics, like Newton's laws are to physics, but I'm just a layperson. \n\nAre these criticisms supported by a lot of economists? Is supply and demand really in doubt? Or are these just fringe positions that aren't backed up by research?",
    "answer": "&gt;Is this a mainstream position in economics at all?\n\nNo. But we can expand on that a bit.\n\nSupply and demand is a model. Models are approximations of reality. Whether a model is a good approximation of realty in any specific application depends on how well the particular market you're studying lines up with the assumptions of the model. For example, S&amp;D assumes that (a) everyone knows what they're buying, (b) every firm in the market is selling basically the same good, and (c) there are many buyers and sellers, so that no one customer or firm has outsized influence on the good's price. Some markets satisfy those conditions; others do not.\n\nSupply and demand is a general framework that can be used to study a wide variety of market phenomena. However, if you are studying a specific market at a specific time in a specific place, then you might want to use a more detailed model that better conforms to the application under investigation.\n\nThere is an entire field of economics, *industrial organization,* that studies the behavior of supply in situations where the assumptions of supply and demand are not a good approximation for reality. This includes situations in which there are few competitors (monopoly, oligopoly); situations in which competitors compete on brand (monopolistic competition), situations in which one firm's actions depend on the actions of others (game theory), etc. All of these models allow for a more detailed analysis than simple S&amp;D. \n\nUsually S&amp;D should be the first place you go to solve your problem, but not necessarily the last place. You can use S&amp;D to get coarse answers to most questions, and more detailed models to get richer answers. \n\n-----\n\nRegarding the two criticisms you mentioned:\n\n1. S&amp;D is not a tautology; classical consumer and producer theory produces implications that can be tested against data. However, S&amp;D *is* a very general framework (by design), so it can accommodate a rather wide range of behavior.\n\n2. Under supply and demand, firms set price equal to marginal cost. There is no markup, and no profit. This is an extreme prediction. In most richer industrial organization models, firms set price equal to a markup over marginal cost. The size of the markup is a key object of interest in IO, and usually can be linked to demand parameters or other such primitives. But it's not necessarily \"fixed.\" Furthermore, in many IO models, the size of the markup falls as the number of competitors grows large -- so S&amp;D is the \"limit\" as the number of competitors grows.\n\n  You can even use these richer models to put bounds on how good the S&amp;D approximation is; for example, some models allow claims such as \"for any industry with more than 10 competitors, the S&amp;D-predicted price will be within 10% of the more complicated model's predicted price.\" Such bounds can be helpful, and put S&amp;D in its proper context. I wouldn't say these results \"invalidate\" S&amp;D, they just provide a richer model of the price-setting environment.\n\nSo, again, S&amp;D is usually a good first stab at most problems at a high level, and the answers one obtains can be refined by using more advanced models. There are famous cases where the S&amp;D answer and the more complicated model's answer are totally different (such as the case of price controls), but those are famous in part because they're rare.\n\nThink of models less in terms of, \"is the model right or wrong,\" and more, \"is it more or less useful in this particular situation?\" or, \"is it more or less useful in giving reasonable answers in a broad range of situations?\""

    "answer": "We'll take your Jeff Bezos example. The majority of Bezos's fortune is held in Amazon stock. If Bezos wanted to turn his stock into cash, he would simply sell his Amazon stock. However, because he owns such a large amount of Amazon stock, if he decided to dump all of it at once, it would hurt Amazon's share price and lower his net worth in the process. So he'd have to sell it very slowly over time to realise it's full value, assuming the stock price held stable over this time period which is a big assumption. If you taxed his wealth highly enough, then you'd see him have to devalue Amazon stock by selling off enough shares to cover the tax burden."

    "question": "I'm not involved in real estate much, but I can't help but think that heavily over-paying on a property (which, granted, is a long-term investment) seems a bit crazy on the surface to me.\n\nMany are paying cash, waiving appraisals\/inspections etc just to get to the top of a list for property listed 48 hours ago. I'm in the US, and I'm a bit familiar with how much foreign investors are at play.\n\nIs this just a potential recipe for another major bust, or is there more to this story than I understand?",
    "answer": "So when you say another \"major bust\" I suspect that you might be thinking of another 2008 style crash. It's important to note that there can be a decrease in home values without the broader economic effects that we saw in 2008.\n\nIn 2008 there essentially was a lot of things that in one way or another were relying on the fact that home values could only go up. There were a lot of risky mortgages being given out to people who could only afford them by cashing in on rising home prices. Securitization of these loans along with very poor credit ratings led a lot of the financial industry to be exposed to these loans without realizing the risk involved, and the entire economy is very exposed to the financial industry. Eventually new construction responded to the boom in the housing market, which leveled out prices and then the house of cards described above started to collapse.\n\nContrast that with now. There are many causes and it's hard to pinpoint the exact magnitude but they appear to be different than what we saw then.\n\nFirst is low inventory. While the housing market appears to be booming, there's actually not many people selling their home right now. This is most likely because people don't want to move during a pandemic. \n\nThen there's higher savings rates. While the pandemic hit many people hard economically, many others are able to (and almost forced to) save more now than ever. Many of the things people normally spend on (travel, entertainment, commuting costs) are no longer there. Add some government assistance like stimulus checks as a bonus and many people are racking up savings. This is very different than 2008 where [savings was very low](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20071217193831\/http:\/\/www.bea.gov\/briefrm\/saving.htm) and it was fueled by lending. There's a lot of cash offers being thrown around and no indication that banks are loosening their lending requirements.\n\nAnother factor is the pandemic changing what markets are desirable. Many people can now work from anywhere, and cities have many aspects shut down or limited so people want to move to places further from their office where they can have more space. This leads to excess demand in places that never had this level of demand before.\n\nThe point of all this is to say that there's not much of an indication of systemic risk in any of these explanations we see. This is a short term trend currently, and the low volume means not many people actually paid these prices. Furthermore, people seem to be able to afford these prices and have a sufficient amount of equity in these houses, banks don't seem to be overly exposed. \n\nIf the housing market corrected tomorrow back to 2019 levels, we would likely see a small minority of homeowners underwater (those who bought at the peak 2020 levels) and they would likely take the losses themselves rather than us seeing 2008 levels of foreclosures. For everyone else, they would be in the same place as before the pandemic (with regard to their home value). The trend could also continue as several of the reasons listed above could be lasting changes.\n\nThere could be a systemic risk exposed with a sudden correction in housing prices, but that's not readily apparent in the time being. I know this rambled quite a bit but the main point I was trying to get at is that the housing market can go up and down -- even quite dramatically -- and it doesn't mean there has to be giant rippling effects across the economy."

There are additional measures you can take to make that more effective (make it harder to leave the country, etc.)."

    "question": "Are trade unionists right, that the companies they work for have large enough profits to raise all their wages? \n\nMy understanding was a lot of businesses operate on very slim margins. But in the UK (and elsewhere) there is a wave of trade union strike action. Across all sectors from trains, to nurses. \n\nAll are demanding higher pay. Which seems perfectly fair on an individual level giving the cost of living crisis. \n\nThey claim that companies are making huge profits, which should go to workers. Is this generally speaking true? Are they making large enough profits for these above inflation pay rises?",
    "answer": "The reason you're not getting any answers is because it's impossible to formulate a general answer that applies to every sector\/company, let alone to every country with its own economic intricacies. \n\nIf you can give an example of a specific company, we could look up its financial reports, but without a clear target this is a very difficult conversation to have without getting overly political."

    "question": "https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/02\/08\/965483266\/-15-minimum-wage-would-reduce-poverty-but-cost-jobs-cbo-says\n\nTo what degree could the loss of jobs be explained by people no longer needing to work 2nd or 3rd jobs? Also, I'm starting to feel like there's no reason an advanced, modernized economy shouldn't consider workers getting paid more to do less a positive indicator, even something to be strived for, in which case less poverty and fewer jobs is perhaps the ideal outcome. Call me a dirty socialist, but what are the flaws in my interpretation here? I feel like my thesis must have lots of holes, but I don't understand economics well enough to spot them.",
    "answer": "It isn't necessarily bad, no. But it depends. I do not think many labor economists would endorse the story you describe, however.\n\nIt's more like this. It turns out, people who take minimum wage jobs tend to have high employment churn rates, meaning they may hold a number of jobs throughout the year, but not holding any job for very long. Think being employees at job A for 3 months, then being unemployed for a month, then having job B for 4 months, then having no job for 2 months, etc.\n\nGiven the above, what happens if unemployment goes up a little bit? Well, rather then a specific set of full time employed workers losing their jobs and staying unemployed throughout the year, a more typical result would be for people going from 9mo employed throughout the year to 8mo (or however many months) employed throughout the year. And in that case, so long as the wage increase is large enough, it can offset the reduction in unemployment for each person such that they come out ahead in terms of annual earnings.\n\nOf course, for a large enough increase in unemployment, this math doesn't come out favorably for workers. And for large unemployment increases, like during the great recession, you do see people become long term unemployed - that's basically the case where you go from working however much to not working at all all year long.\n\nAs for your initial theory, that people may simply be choosing to work less because their incomes are higher. This is a phenomenon to some extent, but it is offset by the phenomenon that people may wish to work more when higher wages are offered. My recollection is that there isn't any good evidence that income effects (the labor econ phrase for the effect of having more money on your willingness to work) are substantially negative in this income range.\n\nAs a final note, I would mention that the cbo report has an idiosyncratically large estimate of the impact of minimum wages on employment that is larger than the largest negative estimates promoted by the minority of labor economists who think that minimum wages increases have a notable negative effect on employment. It's a bit hard to explain how they got to it as well. They seem to have done a mini lit review, gotten to an unusually large estimate, and then multiplied it by one and a half for no particular good reason."

I'd get their advice (it's usually by the book, good stuff), but I'd avoid paying them annual fees to manage your stuff.

You can expect about 8% a year, or 800k on 10 million. At your age of 45 and given your earnings and wealth are so much larger than what you need, you can easily manage the volatility of the market without being impacted, and stocks remain the highest returning asset class. You could keep spending 200k (2%) a year and never see the money run out, especially not if you're going to be making that in earnings from your salary. Then decide on donating and writing a will, a little later in the next few years as you get more comfortable and knowledgeable."

The question I have is whether the world’s health care degrades as a consequence of the US moving to a Medicare for all model. \n\nThere are clear and distinct problems with the incentive structures for healthcare in the US. They are difficult to solve but there should be a ton of effort to resolve them. Because they exist there are a ton of inefficiencies that exacerbate cost without adding value. \n\nI think the best thing the US could do is fix these issues to get the most efficient prices, allow insurance companies to offer discreet insurance products related to the direct cost to insure and individual (i.e. a rider if you smoke, a discount if you can run an 8 minute mile), and subsidize those individuals that need help getting insured. That would result in a more efficient model than a medicare for all solution. I would expect total healthcare costs to fall and outcomes to be better. \n\nOne thing that you don’t want to impact by healthcare reform, is the fact that, in terms of quality of care, the US is the undisputed leader.

    "question": "I’m trying to grasp if billionaires actually pose a significant impact on the working class. On the consumer side I wouldn’t think they would trigger much inflation outside of stocks since their consumption for food, cars etc. are similar to a working class consumer. Perhaps on the income side they cause a suppression of wages by extracting excess value but wouldn’t competition generally minimize that excess? What am I missing or is there no fundamental problem with billionaires?",
    "answer": "&gt; What am I missing or is there no fundamental problem with billionaires?\n\nFrom an income distribution perspective billionaires are pretty irrelevant representing an extreme outlier that politicians like using as an excuse for tax policy (in both directions). Depending on the level of corruption (NB - corruption doesn't just mean bribes, its policy influence in general) in a country they can be created due to extractive policies but these tend to be fairly obvious.\n\nWhile the $1t in income more than $1m earned each year would certainly be a useful source of revenue to combat deficits and the demographic wall facing us its not enough. For the broad based social welfare systems we have, and want to increase, we need broad based tax increases so we look like the rest of the world (the US has low rates of income tax but currently extremely progressive, they need to be higher rates and less progressive). 63% of filers are between $50k and $500k but tax increases for most of those are out of the question politically.\n\n&gt; On the consumer side I wouldn’t think they would trigger much inflation outside of stocks since their consumption for food, cars etc. are similar to a working class consumer.\n\nInflation occurring because people have excess income which they are spending instead of saving is a good thing, its generally not harmful to other consumers as an increase in demand for goods also increases demand for labor (higher wages). This is also why immigration is a net positive across most income groups.\n\nOne good tax policy for the wealthy is smarter &amp; better estate tax design to avoid large inheritances which would have an outsized effect on intergenerational mobility (if you are concerned with inequality this is primarily where policy should be focused). You want to encourage them to spend as much as they can while alive, tax as much as you can after they die (estate taxes are in a fairly unique part of tax policy of having extremely low distortionary costs if designed correctly) but avoid taxing in a way that causes privately owned businesses to break up.\n\nOn the last point this has been one of the most significant challenges of design to date. If someone dies and they own a private corporation if the estate tax is high enough those inheriting the business would have to sell or dissolve the business to pay estate taxes which is not a desirable outcome. Creating a loophole for private businesses would just mean the wealthy would move their capital in to a private business to avoid the taxes but large privately owned businesses dissolving is extremely disruptive."

I find this (static view) hard to believe, as the boomers can't really take their wealth beyond the grave, and the younger generation will have to, by definition, acquire wealth that is passed on in due time. Is this not the case? Why are some millennials complaining when the boomer wealth simply \\_must go somewhere\\_ in a few decades?\n\nAssuming boomers cannot take wealth beyond grave, where do the money actually go? Is there a study of how wealth transfers across generation due to the passing of members of the older generation? Do they mostly get gobbled up by family, or government, or the real-estate market?

For instance, for a family of 3, making $21000 a year is considered poverty but at the same time, take that to some 3rd world country and you’re living in luxury.",
    "answer": "[Anand and Segal (2017)](http:\/\/www.lse.ac.uk\/International-Inequalities\/Assets\/Documents\/Working-Papers\/Working-Paper-8-Who-are-the-Global-Top-1.pdf) find that the threshold to be in the top 1 percent (edit: as of 2012) is $50,600 *per person in a household*, so around $150,000 for a family of three. This puts only 7.7% of the US population in the global top 1%. The figure of $32,400 was based on different data with less coverage of the richest people in the world, and so is probably an underestimate. But that figure was also per person in a household, so $97,200 for a family of 3 would be the threshold.\n\nOn the other hand, 60.7% of Americans are in the top *ten* percent of income according to the same figures. The threshold for that is only $15,300 per person, $46,000 for a family of three. And that is adjusted for cost of living, because it uses [purchasing power parity](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Purchasing_power_parity) exchange rates. The fact is that there are billions of people in the world who are poorer than the median American, or even Americans below the poverty line. \n\nThat doesn't mean it's not justified for Americans to complain about their wages. Poor or middle-class Americans might have more income than most other people in the world, but if they're not earning as much as they could be with different government policy or employer behavior, there's no reason why they shouldn't complain about that."

    "question": "I've read that Marxism has fallen so out of favor in economics that there are few, if any economists who take it seriously.\n\nI'm not a Marxist if for no other reason than it requires the discredited labor theory of value, but Marx did make some amazing predictions, including the mass displacement of workers by technology (and yes, I know he dropped the ball on a number of others—he should have taken Malthus seriously).\n\nPerhaps a better question would be, \"what place, if any, does Marx have in economics today other than as a historical curiosity?\"",

    "question": "I know this sounds like a stupid question but I'm trying to understand more nuance in the history of economics. Growing up, and on most of the internet, Capitalism has rarely ever been defined, and more just put in contrast to something like Communism. I am asking for a semi-complete definition of what exactly Capitalism is and means.\n\nA quick search leads you to some simple answers like private ownership of goods and properties along with Individual trade and commerce. But hasn't this by and large always been the case in human society? Ancient Romans owned land and goods. You could go up to an apple seller and haggle a price for apples. What exactly about Capitalism makes it relatively new and different?\n\nThank you,",
    "answer": "&gt; I know this sounds like a stupid question....\n\nNo it doesn't, not at all.\n\n&gt; A quick search leads you to some simple answers like private ownership of goods and properties along with Individual trade and commerce. But hasn't this by and large always been the case in human society? Ancient Romans owned land and goods. You could go up to an apple seller and haggle a price for apples. What exactly about Capitalism makes it relatively new and different?\n\nThis is the problem. The term \"Capitalism\" was created by people who declared themselves to be critics of Capitalism. They also tried to define it as something fairly new. At least something that happened after ~1600. But, as you point out trade and ownership are ancient in origin (as is money). It is remarkably hard to come up with a definition of Capitalism that's really satisfactory.\n\nLet's think about what's necessary to make Capitalism something modern, something that happened after the year 1600. That rules-out lots of things. Trade can't be the defining factor, that's ancient. Money can't be the defining factor either, that's also ancient. The same is true of private property. The inequality of private property is also ancient. In many past societies there was landowners and merchants who owned lots of property, while the common people owned very little.\n\nSome would reach for slavery or serfdom. The idea here is that Capitalism is defined by markets and private property, but also by the *lack* of slavery. This also doesn't really work. Nearly always, in ancient societies there was slavery. Similarly, there was something like serfdom in most Manorial societies (as far as I know). But, sometimes it wasn't commonplace. So, if only a tiny population of slaves exist in a place how can that mean that it's not Capitalist?\n\nAnother criteria that people advocate is wage labour. The idea here is that there's Capitalism if workers are paid wages. Payment through wages is an old idea and the Romans had salaries. Also, places without market economies still had wages, such as the USSR. We can imagine a world much like our own with no wages. Businesses pay people for specific acts of work, not by the hour. Each person is a small business (a sole-trader). In such a world there would still be markets and money. Rich people could still be rich because they could rent out things to others (e.g. property and machinery).\n\nEconomists tend not to use the word Capitalism so much because of the problems of defining it."

    "answer": "Doesn't sound realistic to me... If you bought SCHD at inception (2012) and held during a strong bull market with low rates, your dividend income would have grown at a 15.6% CAGR. This is factoring in DRIP, no taxes, and 0 additional contributions.\n\n$250k invested into SCHD at inception would have paid $33.4k worth of dividends in 2022. If we project out 10 years into the future and simply say that dividend income will keep growing 15% per year, we finish with $135k\/year over a 20 year period. (still pretty good)\n\nBut even if we assume favorable market conditions for the next 20 years, can we really expect that dividend income to keep compounding at 15% per year? And even if it does, that's still nowhere near $900k... \n\nYou'd need about a 26% CAGR for 20 years to turn today's SCHD dividend into $900k."

    "question": "I mean that's enough to have 100% control right? \n\nAlso, when it is reported that he offers to buy Twitter, from whom is it? Wouldn't he just buy all the shares? Or are many of them not on the market?",
    "answer": "Control over a company isn't binary, but exists on a spectrum. References to ownership here are by voting power, not economic interest, because lots of companies have dual-class shares. While 51% ownership guarantees a significant amount of control, a much smaller ownership, even under 5% at times, allows disproportionate influence, whereas other decisions need to be passed by a supermajority of 2\/3 or 3\/4 of votes, depending on the company's articles.\n\nHowever, I believe the general facts aren't as pertinent here as the specific history of Elon Musk, who has been at loggerheads with the SEC, the regulator of listed securities in the US. Even if he were to own 90% of the shares, if the remaining 10% were listed on a US stock exchange, he'd be bound by their regulations in a way that he wouldn't if the company were to go private. This would apply to any company going private, but I think it is of disproportionate importance to Musk. \n\nAs for the second part, shares don't get “on the market” unless the owner gives the specific order to the broker to sell. What happens most of the time is that these transactions, for tiny fractions of a company's shareholding, are conveyed to the stock exchange. However, when you want to buy a massive chunk of the shareholding, up to and including all of it, it becomes a lot easier and cheaper (edit: and sometimes necessary; see below) to make a tender offer, wherein you announce the number of shares and price per share you're soliciting (kind of similar to regular trades via the exchange, but much more formal and involved). Shareholders then subscribe to your offer if they want to sell at your price, rather than placing a sell order on the exchange. If he were just to buy shares off the market, he would be restricted to buying the shares that shareholders wanted to sell (at prevailing prices) anyway, rather than specifically informing them of his intention.\n\nIt becomes necessary to make a tender offer because there are regulations in place regarding a minimum proportion of the company's shares (here, by economic interest, not voting power, I think) to be owned by shareholders not affiliated with or able to directly influence the management. Called ‘free float’, this minimum is 20% in the US, which means that Musk would not be able to perform what's known as a creeping acquisition, buying up shares on the open market, because he would eventually hit that 80% theoretical maximum before he had to make a tender offer, assuming other insiders and active investors agreed to sell to him. Most of the time, investors looking to exert their influence don't need to acquire nearly as many shares. Note how he was already the largest shareholder with a 9% stake, and had been invited to the board."

Here is the math assuming you risk 1% of your account per trade.\n\n|Capital|Risk Unit (%)|Risk Unit ($)|Monthly Goal ($)|Monthly Goal (R's)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$125,000|1.00%|$1,250|$21,000|16.8|\n\n**17R a month is actually not that difficult to achieve—it's less than 1R per day.** Let's call it 20R before commissions, fees, expenses, etc.\n\nHow do you go about returning 20R per month? Do the math again. Here's an example comparing the win-rate and return-to-risk (R2R) combination that leads to 20R profit after **50 trades.**\n\n|Accuracy|Reward-to-risk|Return in Rs|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|40%|2.5:1|20|\n|50%|2:1|25|\n|60%|1.5:1|25|\n|70%|1:1|20|\n|80%|0.75:1|20|\n\nThe above table is just one way to achieve 20-25R. You might end up taking less trades or more per month. But there is some balance between accuracy and R2R which will allow you to hit your goal based on your trading style.\n\nA Risk Unit is simply a function of your account size; the consistent trader continues doing the same thing up to a certain dollar-risk level which is feasible given constraints such as liquidity, volume, mental ceiling, etc.\n\nIf you can consistently make $10\/day, all you need to do is scale up to achieve $100 per day, and eventually $1,000.\n\nCheers and best of luck."

Small time landlords - which constitutes close to 50% of all landlords - can’t keep up with taxes\/insurance\/mortgage payments which all remain due and they start to be forced to sell. Big companies\/hedge funds like Blackstone gobble up said properties at well over asking knowing they can take short term losses. However they jack up rents nonetheless to offset their losses. Properties values and rents go thru the roof. Soon the average Joe can’t afford to buy property and renters are essentially slaves to the hedge funds due to most of their monthly income going to rent. Then the Great Reset will be complete.

    "question": "So I’ve been poor all my life 26M. I got really lucky and won 20k on the horses. 6k of it is going on self improvement (hair transplant and a few other things) 3-3.5k of it is going on paying off some bills for my mum and spoiling her rotten. That leaves me with about 5-6 left after other treats and stuff. Not really sure what the hell to do with it.

    "answer": "A really common trap that people fall into when getting a windfall like this, is to spend it immediately. I would recommend holding onto it and just psychologically getting used to having that amount of money under your control. People tend to want to 'get rid' of money because they aren't used to having it. Take some time, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, to just acclimatise to having that cash. You'll have many nights to sleep on it, to think about the best uses, and to not do anything rash with it. Being poor your entire life and then coming into a significant amount of money like this is going to mess with your head a bit.   \n\n\nSolve the urgent things that can be solved with your money, but for everything else, push it back for the next 3 months and work through the shock and panic that you'll be going through. \n\nI would also say, now that you've won at the Races you're going to be tempted to get that hit again. Do your very best to not give into that temptation. There's a common saying - no one leaves Vegas a winner: the losers lose their money, and the winners stick around chasing the thrill until they give back all their gains."

You're not just selling high and buying low, your playing against companies and investors so big and so influential they can convince you of anything.

    "answer": "What metrics do you mean specifically?\n\n[Looking at GDP per capita](https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=true), Nordic countries aren't particular standouts on the list (Norway at 11, Denmark at 14, Sweden at 19, Finland at 22).\n\n[Household disposable income](https:\/\/data.oecd.org\/hha\/household-disposable-income.htm) shows that they're doing well but also not particular standouts.\n\nOne thing these countries are notable for, and something that you're likely more curious about, [is how well they've been able to keep people out of poverty compared to other developed nations](https:\/\/data.oecd.org\/inequality\/poverty-rate.htm) where we're able to keep measurements.\n\nThere's a number of policies that have helped to accomplish this while still performing well in overall wealth metrics. One thing these countries have in common is [an interesting tax structure](https:\/\/taxfoundation.org\/scandinavian-countries-taxes-2021\/) compared to the US and other EU nations. Businesses pay lower taxes, and the very wealthy pay lower taxes, but the middle-upper class and moderately wealthy pay significantly more in income taxes and social security payments. Businesses also play a much larger role in subsidizing social security in Nordic countries (minus Denmark), and the sectoral bargaining agreements mean that firms have much less monopsony power to keep wages below equilibrium levels. The document I've linked here goes much further in depth regarding tax policy.\n\nOn the welfare side of the equation, Scandinavian countries have some of the most generous child benefits, parental leave, and unemployment protection programs in the developed world, as well as universal education and healthcare. [One thing to note is that Nordic countries also have fairly stringent work requirements](https:\/\/www.iza.org\/publications\/dp\/7084\/in-work-benefits-and-the-nordic-model) for someone to have access to these programs\n\nOne thing to also note is that while these countries have traditionally done a good job of reducing poverty, [it is difficult for unskilled laborers to find work with the collective bargaining agreements that are in place and with how educated the rest of the work force is.](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-sweden-unemployment-pandemic\/new-swedes-left-out-as-economy-powers-through-pandemic-idUSKBN2B91MO) Unskilled work mostly goes to people who have an education and can be promoted to more specialized work when available."

    "question": "Hi ! \n\nI was reading the comments of two threads on this subreddit this morning and saw that a lot of new investors did not know about the 15% whitholding tax on US dividend in TFSA. \n\nSo quick reminder, most US stocks that are held inside a TFSA will have a 15% tax on the dividend they pay. You don't need to do anything, they take it before you get the money. (Correct me if I'm wrong on this) \n\nHOWEVER, the capital gains are tax free. So for example if you bought 10 MSFT for 100$ and sold them at 200$ one year later, you would have made 1000$ tax free but had lost 15% of the dividend received. ( 2,24 x 15% = 0,33$ )\n\nTo save the 15% tax, you need to hold US stocks in an RRSP because they're is a tax treaty between US and Canada. \n\nFor more details : [Article about this](http:\/\/www.lucierwealth.ca\/Should-you-ever-hold-US-stocks-in-your-Tax-Free-Savings-Account-(TFSA).aspx#:~:text=Unlike%20Canadian%20income%20producing%20assets,avoid%20the%2015%25%20withholding%20tax.)",
    "answer": "Honestly I think people tend to spend too much time worrying about stuff like this. A 15% tax on dividends means a US stock that pays a 4% dividend will instead give you a 3.40% dividend in your TFSA. Sure, if you want to optimize, aim to have US dividend stocks in your RRSP and US growth stocks in your TFSA, but on the list of decisions that affect people's wealth, this is pretty low down on the list."

    "question": "Hello! I am in the midst of writing several articles about the Canadian housing crisis. I am looking into the various arguments for\/against landlords economic value in the economy. \n- What are some potential implications to an economy if being a landlord is more profitable than being innovative? \n- what role or necessity to landlords play in an economy? (Not developers but just landlords)\n\nAny articles\/sources are welcomed. Ideally tailored to the non economic reader. Thanks",
    "answer": "Generally they bear risks so renters don't have to. Usually a home owner is responsible for maintenance and repair of appliances and utilities, which requires some amount of budgeting for that. They also have to deal with the investment risks. If the local housing market goes badly they are on the hook, or if the HOA mismanages something they are on the hook not renters, etc. Same for structural insurance and the like. A renter has to insure her own stuff, but the owner insures the property from fires, floods, etc. or in some cases simply self insures with savings. \n\nIt's a trade off, risk for price. To bear the risk responsibly you need savings, some people don't have large savings.\n\nYou could also make an argument that landlords make moving easier. There are lots of hurdles involved in home sale\/purchases, but very little to be done when renting. In this way they can be seen as a way to help increase the 'efficiency' of the housing distribution -- making it easy for people to move closer to work etc.\n\nAs for your question about landlords vs innovative ideas, I'm quite sure they're not mutually exclusive. There are plenty of innovative property management ideas out there."

When the company recruiter asked me what my target salary was, I responded by asking, \"What is the range for the position?\" to which they responded with their target, which was $30k more than I was expecting\/am making now. Essentially, if I would have given the range I was hoping for (even if it was +$10k more than I am making it now) I still would have sold myself short. \n\nGranted, this is just an interview and not an offer- but I'm happy knowing that I didn't lowball myself from the getgo.

If they required proof or something I would've just explain how I calculated it all.\n\nI think the whole interview process is really shady.

    "answer": "Apologies for the wall of text, but Acemoglu and Robinson discuss this issue (and Diamond's works specifically) in the second chapter of Why Nations Fail:\n\n&gt;Another influential version of the geography hypothesis is\nadvanced by the ecologist and evolutionary biologist Jared\nDiamond. He argues that the origins of intercontinental\ninequality at the start of the modern period, five hundred\nyears ago, rested in different historical endowments of\nplant and animal species, which subsequently influenced\nagricultural productivity. In some places, such as the Fertile Crescent in the modern Middle East, there were a large\nnumber of species that could be domesticated by humans. Elsewhere, such as the Americas, there were not. Having many species capable of being domesticated made it very\nattractive for societies to make the transition from a huntergatherer to a farming lifestyle. As a consequence, farming\ndeveloped earlier in the Fertile Crescent than in the Americas. Population density grew, allowing specialization\nof labor, trade, urbanization, and political development. Crucially, in places where farming dominated, technological\ninnovation took place much more rapidly than in other parts\nof the world. Thus, according to Diamond, the differential\navailability of animal and plant species created differential\nintensities of farming, which led to different paths of\ntechnological change and prosperity across different\ncontinents.\n\n\n&gt;Though Diamond’s thesis is a powerful approach to the\npuzzle on which he focuses, it cannot be extended to\nexplain modern world inequality. For example, Diamond\nargues that the Spanish were able to dominate the\ncivilizations of the Americas because of their longer history\nof farming and consequent superior technology. But we\nnow need to explain why the Mexicans and Peruvians\ninhabiting the former lands of the Aztecs and Incas are\npoor. While having access to wheat, barley, and horses might have made the Spanish richer than the Incas, the gap\nin incomes between the two was not very large. The\naverage income of a Spaniard was probably less than\ndouble that of a citizen of the Inca Empire. Diamond’s\nthesis implies that once the Incas had been exposed to all\nthe species and resulting technologies that they had not\nbeen able to develop themselves, they ought quickly to\nhave attained the living standards of the Spanish. Yet\nnothing of the sort happened. On the contrary, in the\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, a much larger gap in\nincomes between Spain and Peru emerged. Today the\naverage Spaniard is more than six times richer than the\naverage Peruvian. This gap in incomes is closely\nconnected to the uneven dissemination of modern industrial\ntechnologies, but this has little to do either with the potential\nfor animal and plant domestication or with intrinsic\nagricultural productivity differences between Spain and\nPeru. \n\n&gt;While Spain, albeit with a lag, adopted the technologies\nof steam power, railroads, electricity, mechanization, and\nfactory production, Peru did not, or at best did so very\nslowly and imperfectly. This technological gap persists\ntoday and reproduces itself on a bigger scale as new\ntechnologies, in particular those related to information\ntechnology, fuel further growth in many developed and\nsome rapidly developing nations. Diamond’s thesis does\nnot tell us why these crucial technologies are not diffusing\nand equalizing incomes across the world and does not\nexplain why the northern half of Nogales is so much richer\nthan its twin just to the south of the fence, even though both were part of the same civilization five hundred years ago.\nThe story of Nogales highlights another major problem in\nadapting Diamond’s thesis: as we have already seen, whatever the drawbacks of the Inca and Aztec empires were in 1532, Peru and Mexico were undoubtedly more\nprosperous than those parts of the Americas that went on\nto become the United States and Canada. North America\nbecame more prosperous precisely because it\nenthusiastically adopted the technologies and advances of\nthe Industrial Revolution. The population became educated\nand railways spread out across the Great Plains in stark\ncontrast to what happened in South America. This cannot\nbe explained by pointing to differential geographic\nendowments of North and South America, which, if\nanything, favored South America.\n\n\n&gt;Inequality in the modern world largely results from the\nuneven dissemination and adoption of technologies, and\nDiamond’s thesis does include important arguments about\nthis. For instance, he argues, following the historian William\nMcNeill, that the east–west orientation of Eurasia enabled\ncrops, animals, and innovations to spread from the Fertile Crescent into Western Europe, while the north–south\norientation of the Americas accounts for why writing\nsystems, which were created in Mexico, did not spread to\nthe Andes or North America. Yet the orientation of\ncontinents cannot provide an explanation for today’s world\ninequality. Consider Africa. Though the Sahara Desert did\npresent a significant barrier to the movement of goods and\nideas from the north to sub-Saharan Africa, this was not\ninsurmountable. The Portuguese, and then other Europeans, sailed around the coast and eliminated\ndifferences in knowledge at a time when gaps in incomes were very small compared with what they are today. Since\nthen, Africa has not caught up with Europe; on the contrary,\nthere is now a much larger income gap between most\nAfrican and European countries.\n\n&gt;It should also be clear that Diamond’s argument, which is\nabout continental inequality, is not well equipped to explain\nvariation within continents—an essential part of modern world inequality. For example, while the orientation of the Eurasian landmass might explain how England managed to\nbenefit from the innovations of the Middle East without\nhaving to reinvent them, it doesn’t explain why the Industrial\nRevolution happened in England rather than, say, Moldova.\nIn addition, as Diamond himself points out, China and India\nbenefited greatly from very rich suites of animals and\nplants, and from the orientation of Eurasia. But most of the\npoor people of the world today are in those two countries.\n\n\n&gt;In fact, the best way to see the scope of Diamond’s\nthesis is in terms of his own explanatory variables. Map 4\nshows data on the distribution of Sus scrofa, the ancestor\nof the modern pig, and the aurochs, ancestor of the modern\ncow. Both species were widely distributed throughout\nEurasia and even North Africa. Map 5 (this page) shows\nthe distribution of some of the wild ancestors of modern\ndomesticated crops, such as Oryza sativa, the ancestor of\nAsian cultivated rice, and the ancestors of modern wheat\nand barley. It demonstrates that the wild ancestor of rice was distributed widely across south and southeast Asia, while the ancestors of barley and wheat were distributed\nalong a long arc from the Levant, reaching through Iran and\ninto Afghanistan and the cluster of “stans” (Turkmenistan,\nTajikistan, and Krgyzistan). These ancestral species are\npresent in much of Eurasia. But their wide distribution\nsuggests that inequality within Eurasia cannot be explained\nby a theory based on the incidence of the species.\n\n\n&gt;The geography hypothesis is not only unhelpful for\nexplaining the origins of prosperity throughout history, and mostly incorrect in its emphasis, but also unable to account\nfor the lay of the land we started this chapter with. One might argue that any persistent pattern, such as the\nhierarchy of incomes within the Americas or the sharp and\nlong-ranging differences between Europe and the Middle East, can be explained by unchanging geography. But this\nis not so. We have already seen that the patterns within the Americas are highly unlikely to have been driven by\ngeographical factors. Before 1492 it was the civilizations in\nthe central valley of Mexico, Central America, and the Andes that had superior technology and living standards to North America or places such as Argentina and Chile. While the geography stayed the same, the institutions\nimposed by European colonists created a “reversal of\nfortune.” Geography is also unlikely to explain the poverty of\nthe Middle East for similar reasons. After all, the Middle East led the world in the Neolithic Revolution, and the first\ntowns developed in modern Iraq. Iron was first smelted in\nTurkey, and as late as the Middle Ages the Middle East was technologically dynamic. It was not the geography of\nthe Middle East that made the Neolithic Revolution flourish\nin that part of the world, as we will see in chapter 5, and it was, again, not geography that made the Middle East poor.\nInstead, it was the expansion and consolidation of the Ottoman Empire, and it is the institutional legacy of this\nempire that keeps the Middle East poor today.\n\n\n&gt;Finally, geographic factors are unhelpful for explaining\nnot only the differences we see across various parts of the world today but also why many nations such as Japan or China stagnate for long periods and then start a rapid\ngrowth process. We need another, better theory."

    "question": "Hi Everyone\n\nSince most people get to buy\/sell real estate properties (flats, lands, commercial , etc.) only few times in their lifetimes, everyone learns something or the other that they wish they knew before.\n\n**What was your learning?**\n\nIt could be related to\n\n* tactics from real estate agents\n* some obscure law that you didn't knew about\n* something you realized you should have thought of checking\/considered before buying that land or flat, etc.\n* legal issues or missing some documentation or due diligence\n* etc.\n\nWant to pool your experience and learnings together for everyone to learn from!\n\nFootnote: Originally posted on r\/india but no traction whatsoever. Hoping to get helpful responses from here.",
    "answer": "After doing a few real estate transactions, the things I have noticed are:\n\n1)There is way too much overhead in the form of registration fees, stamp duty, lawyer fees, bribes etc. In any deal, 10% of the price of the property be it land or house goes in covering these overheads. 2-5% brokerage fees are extra. So you could end up paying up to 15% extra in total. If this is an investment for you, your land price must increase by 15% before you breakeven.\n\nEarlier circles rates were very low, so people didn't care as much about these fees but now in many places, circle rates are actually more than the market rates. This can burn a massive hole in your pocket because all fees are a percentage of this.\n\n2) Following up on the previous point....buying below circle rate is problematic even if it's legitimitate. I had to cough up a huge amount of money in advance tax this year because of section 56(2)(X) as I bought a parcel of land 20% below circle rate last year. This is just adding salt to the wound because I already paid all the fees and duties based on circle rate.\n\n3) Real estate brokers will vehemently request you to pay money in cash. Don't pay the circle rate amount in cash no matter what. It's illegal to purchase any immovable property with more than 20k in cash. Sub-registrar should ideally refuse to register the property but they don't check anything and you will get notice from IT dept later. The sale deed itself may be nullified and invalidated in such cases.\n\n4) Check if there is any lien on the land. It's possible the owner may have taken a loan on this. Do not buy this unless and until the land owner clears the loan and gets an NOC for it. The land owner may request you to foot the money required to clear the loan outstanding. If you agree to do this, write down everything in a sale agreement along with the cheque number and get the sale agreement registered with the sub-registrar. Broker may insist on a notarized sale agreement to fool you but you must register it to get legal protection. Since the legal system in India is slow as molasses and agreements can often not be enforced, it's best if you avoid giving any money altogether before registration is done.\n\n5) Once you have paid the token money, ask the seller to produce the original title deed. He should have no objection to it. Do not be satisfied with a Xerox copy. If he has taken a loan on the land from the informal sector such as a local moneylender, there won't be any encumbrance on the land that will show up on official records but he won't be able to produce the original deed.\n\n6) Always verify the plot number of the plot you are being sold. Get the plot map from the tehsil or municipality and either verify it yourself if you know how to read maps or pay some money to the tehsildar or patwari or some other competent authority and take him to the site to get it verified in person. If you are shown one land by broker and then another land is registered in your name, you are done for and there is very little recourse later on.\n\n7) Always check for clear title of the land. Inherited land often has multiple stakeholders. Each stakeholder can individually sell off their share in the land without permission of the other stakeholders. Often the seller will show the best portion of the land to you to make the sale attractive and then the other stakeholders will raise a dispute after sale. Now you are screwed. You can't just take that juicy corner plot with road access and build your house as per your fancy and leave the crappy plots behind for others.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that you will become a joint tenant with all the stakeholders after sale and you will NOT have the right to claim any part of that land as exclusively your own. To mitigate this, there should be a written deed on stamp paper that mentions which portion of the land belongs to which stakeholder and it should be signed by all. Without this document, every stakeholder has equal rights to use all parts of the land equally. In addition, on the day of registration, all stakeholders must be present in the sub-registrar's office so that they don't raise a hue and cry after all is said and done.\n\n8) Get your property mutated as soon as registration is done. Don't dilly dally. Real estate sector in India is a mess as is the record keeping. Sale deeds can easily be falsified and it's not uncommon to find the same land sold to multiple people. Sub-registrar checks nothing before registering a deed. Later you find that multiple people are laying claim to the same piece of land. Indian judiciary will take 30 years to sort out that mess. Unless the property records show your name, the deed is of little value. So get your name mutated into the land records as fast as possible. Pay a little here if you have to in order to fast track it.\n\n9) Always hire a lawyer to do some basic due diligence. It will cost you not more than 5k and he will not only verify the title but also prepare the deed and help with the registration formalities. However, since land records are also available online in most places, you should do your own due diligence too. Whatever you see online is what the lawyer will see too. If the property is not in the seller's name, it should immediately raise a red flag. If it's in his ancestor's name, he should provide you with the succession certificate to proof that he has claim over the property.\n\n10) It's very tough to do a proper title verification when it comes to inherited land. So sit with the seller and try to draw the entire family tree in a visual manner on a plain piece of paper. The family tree should start with the original owner and then branch on to the inheritors. Verify this information with the other inheritors who are still alive (stakeholders). This is to make sure the seller didn't miss out on a brother or sister who may have a claim on that land. Now sit with the lawyer and figure out what percentage share of the land the seller actually has as per the family tree and whether it matches with the seller's claim. If seller claims that some stakeholders have sold their stake to him, ask him to produce the sale deeds and mutation certificates for the same. This is a long and arduous process. Take your time.\n\n11) Before registering and paying for any land, go to the tehsil office and request the ameen (land surveyor) to come to the site and measure the land in his official capacity. Some places may require you to fill up a form for this and submit the requisite fee. It's important you get this done. This is to make sure you are getting the exact measurements and land area seller promised you. Then buy some angles and barbed wires and ring fence the entire plot. Wait for a couple of weeks while you carry out the legal due diligence. If nobody shows up and creates a ruckus, then it's probably all good and you can proceed.\n\n12) Before finalizing a deal, be sure to ask the broker how much he is going to charge. 1-2% is the norm in most places but for small deals, the rate can go up to 4-6%. I got a rude shock when my broker asked for 5% after the registration was done for one of my deals. In another deal, broker didn't take any money, probably because he got his cut from the seller.\n\n13) Last but not the least, check if all land taxes have been paid for and all dues are cleared. Land tax is usually very little in most places, so that's not something you need to be worried about. But still why fork out an extra 10k or 20k later on because the previous owner didn't pay his dues?\n\nBuying land anywhere in India, especially in rural area is tough because the record keeping is so poor. Do as much due diligence as possible and leave the rest to fate."

Now that math can and does become very sophisticated over time, but the premise of the strategy is never mathematical, the math is only introduced afterwards to give the idea a rigorous formulation. This formulation is absolutely critical in order to properly validate a trading strategy. In other words, once you have an idea, you need to come up with a system to try to disprove it and the only way to disprove an idea is to give it a firm mathematical foundation and test against that.\n\nI kid you not when I say if I told you our strategies you'd probably just look at us and think \"No way... really? It's that simple?\" Furthermore all of our strategies are arbitrage, we never speculate on the future direction of a stock and only execute a trade when we identify an arbitrage opportunity.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of our challenge comes not from the ideas but in the execution of those strategies; having high quality well written software (that we develop entirely in-house), a robust environment that allows us to quickly identify new opportunities, iterate on them, test them and get quick feedback.\n\nWhat makes a firm or even an individual trader successful isn't the sophistication of a handful of ideas, but rather an environment and culture that can quickly identify an opportunity, subject it to scrutiny, and transform that idea into a simple and straight forward algorithm."

    "answer": "If your point on Twitter was “AMC price is out of line with traditional measures of fundamentals. Therefore you should sell”, then I’m not surprised you got flack because that’s not addressing their main thesis. Hodlers of AMC (and GME) aren’t betting on current measures of traditional fundamentals (“last 12 month PE ratio”, “book value”, etc.) They’re betting on value of a different kind (and it’s not just FOMO buying, though that doesn’t hurt). It’s like if you went long on an undervalued company for the long term and someone told you to sell because the Fibonacci resistance levels on the hourly chart are against you. They might not be wrong per say (assuming Fibonacci resistance levels are valid), but it’s simply not relevant to your strategy. If instead you provided concrete evidence that all shorts had covered, then you would have had a much better reaction because that’s useful to the main thesis (granted, it probably still would be a controversial post, and you almost certainly can’t produce such evidence because the regulatory systems in place have loopholes to let financial institutions fake short interest numbers).\n\nTo be frank, I’m pretty surprised that many value investors (probably including the great Buffet himself) view AMC\/GME with such disdain. Back in the day, Buffet himself found “financial stupidities” in the market where a company was trading for less than just the assets the company owned. He would invest in these stocks even though people thought he was crazy for investing in a “failing company”. I won’t speak for AMC in particular (I haven’t done as much research on AMC), but GME is very much in this vein: the market heavily over-shorted the company, the company is making a turnaround, and now the price needs to adjust back upwards.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can play your strategy while others play theirs.

    "question": "In Germany its very common to rent your entire life, in the uk its very common to become a home owner. \nWhst effects does this have in the economy and wealth inequality?",
    "answer": "This is a misconception. The UK has a relatively similar home ownership rate to Germany, and is [one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/246355\/home-ownership-rate-in-europe\/).\n\nHome ownership [had a peak in 2003](https:\/\/www.nationwide.co.uk\/-\/media\/MainSite\/images\/guides\/news-hub\/2018\/02\/hpi-blog\/England_Home_Ownership.png?h=634&amp;la=en&amp;w=974) so it’s possible that soon the UK will reach the German level of home ownership."

    "question": "\"After the Great Recession, we went through a decade in which economic life was defined by a lack of demand. Now, after the COVID recession, we’ve entered a period in which economic life is defined by a lack of supply”",
    "answer": "I'm not disputing the writer's assertion, but it doesn't match up with my personal experience, and where there have been some shortages the reason is varied.\n\nFor example, the shortage of infant formula had a lot to do with a major supplier that was shut down due to safety concern occurring at the same time as we experienced COVID supply chain issues.\n\nThe shortage of coins is really a shortage of coins circulating, not a shortage of actual coins. This was due to fewer people spending cash.\n\nThe shortage of child care workers is the same issue we are seeing with other high- stress \/ low-pay jobs. No one wants these jobs right now, especially if the work involves dealing with the public.\n\nI hadn't heard of the vet shortage, but looked it up and it's pretty much the same - dissatisfaction with salary and working conditions, especially the expectations and attitudes of clients.\n\nPeople are increasingly rude and hostile towards others, sometimes physically. Veterinarians, child care workers, health care workers, teachers, fast food workers, airline attendants, retail associates, you name it. Everyone is fed up with the public."

And liquidity doesn't put food on the table, or invent new technology, or solve life's problems.\n\nEvery penny he has, has effectively been legally embezzled from society. He produces nothing, but he takes everything with exponential severity.\n\nViolence on the street? That comes from poverty. Violence increasing? That's because poverty increasing.

    "question": "If I didn’t know any better, I’d say Solana is gonna hear from the SEC pretty soon. Their ability to shut down the network on a whim today proves extreme centralization, thus making them a security. And, this has happened several times. Other areas of concern are they have 600 nodes managed by three companies, 95% of total tokens are owned and controlled by VC, Team members, and the foundation. 5% of tokens in circulation are available to purchase. Most of that 95% of the market is locked in staking and has a two day unlocking period. Sending good vibes to the small bag holders that big bags don’t dump. After thoroughly reviewing the project, I’m just not brave enough to catch this flight.",
    "answer": "I am prepared for the downvotes, but let's speak TRUTH to what happened.\n\nSolana was NOT SHUTDOWN on a WHIM. It was overloaded! Very similar to a DoS attack. What is a DoS attack? It is when a server is bombarded by requests so that it cannot function. This happens because servers are limited by their hardware. (think of what happens when you try to run a computer game on max graphics on a crappy computer, it becomes so laggy and your computer might even crash.)\n\nThe reasons why SOLANA stopped working is because of some DeFi project that was spamming transactions on the main chain. Solana has a max TPS of 46,000. But this DeFi project triggered a bug that was creating transactions past that limit. All the validators failed because of their inability to process the sheer amount of transactions that was occurring because of this bug.\n\nAlso think about this logically, why would SOLANA shut down their own network on a whim? That's a nightmare. Also how would that even work? The blockchain has open source code, if this was true, please point to the code that allows this functionality.\n\nI'm not saying this was a NOT a bad event. But SOLANA is in Beta. The dev team of SOLANA has owned up to the bug in their code. It is what it is. Shit goes wrong. People have every reason to sell their SOL because of this issue, it looks bad. It is bad. But they found the bug and they are fixing it."

    "question": "I apologize in advance for how morbid this post is. I am in no way supporting this, I'm merely curious. \n\nLet's hypothetically say that when covid-19 first started, the U.S. decided to do nothing and simply let the disease run it's course and kill anyone that was vulnerable. In March, the Imperial College of London estimated that without intervention, as many as 2.2 million Americans would die. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety places the value of a human life at around $10 million dollars. By this calculation the 2 million excess deaths would cost the economy $20 trillion. \n\nHowever, most of the deaths would be senior citizens who are at the end of their working life and have no more earning potential. Their remaining assets would likely be transferred to their families after death. Covid-19 has already cost the US $16 trillion; from a strictly economic standpoint, would it have made more sense to not address the virus and let it run rampant?",
    "answer": "This is, unfortunately, very much so going to be speculation. Of course, the Imperial College study is already a long time ago in the quickly moving news cycle, and whilst other studies also estimate the [effects of a lockdown](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/goatsandsoda\/2020\/06\/09\/872441984\/modelers-suggest-pandemic-lockdowns-saved-millions-from-dying-of-covid-19), it is difficult to estimate how many lives it would've cost. The important notion here is that mortality rates aren't linear. The study above estimates the amount of cases in april to be 14 times as high if no measures were taken. Seeing that many hospitals and ICU are already overloaded, mortality rates would've spiked. Plus, many choices would've needed to be made on who gets to be treated, and those choices as well affect everything else.\n\n\n\nAs such, I don't think I'm qualified to give you actual numbers. But I do think you underestimate the long-term effect of a shock to population numbers. The reasoning now is that, whilst people may not be visiting your restaurant now, at least there will be people left to visit your restaurant after the pandemic. You have to realize that the people who have ''no more earning potential'' do have spending potential, and inflate the value of assets. Much of the economy, for example, is tied to the housing market. If many younger citizens inheret land and houses relatively suddenly in areas in which they do not wish to live, they will sell these assets causing a housing crash, for example. In that case, those receiving inheretance will in fact not receive much, whilst those who passed away kept the economy partially running with their expenses. \n\n\nThe thing is, there are many ways in which such a scenario could play out. For example, people may even change their behavior to an extent by which it simulates a lockdown. If many people around you are starting to pass, you will be less likely to visit a restaurant and demand working from home if possible. The thing is that *if* you are going to go through a lockdown, you may as well start early - this gives healthcare the chance to find a cure and\/or improve treatment (ICU care has for example dropped from on average a few weeks to a few days).\n\n\nEdit: A wise thing to do would be to look at counterfactuals. [Sweden](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-53664354) for example, has had much less strict regulations. They do see a smaller shrinkage than the EU average, but still, -8.6% compared to -11.9% is not that big of an improvement, and, if recovery is larger in the countries hit worse, the long-term effects may be minimal. Also very important when doing a comparison is to think of the contextual differences; many expected, for example, Africa to be hit very badly by COVID - but this is not the case. This makes complete sense as many African populations have a) more experience with the regulations (due to e.g. Ebola) b) generally live in much more secluded and rural communities (a big reason why contagious diseases have historically plagued Africa less) and c) have an, on average, much younger population. Comparing apples to apples is really difficult here."

    "question": "YouTube for example is full of people trying to teach you how to profit from stock trading, what is the point of wasting time micro managing stocks when index funds exist? Am I missing something?",
    "answer": "There is a small, but nonzero chance of your stocks doing better than index funds. If you do your research into a firm and have an understanding of the industry it's operating in, you may identify smaller firms that will grow significantly more than indices. Investing in a stock index is basically the ultimate in diversifying in the stock market: Your chances of making huge money go down, but your chances of losing money also goes down.\n\nThen the videos themselves can be useful tools to understanding how the stock market works and getting some grasp of economics. So even those who do not participate might watch and come out better. \n\nOn the flipside, the romanticization of the first paragraph's concept, where you could make more money by betting on individual firms rather than on indices brings in viewers as well. The potential rewards of having first put money into Facebook and come out 5 years later with millions of dollars is attractive, if incredibly unlikely. Despite the unlikelihood of this, it is still powerfully attractive to some people, enough to keep a few Youtubers making guides on how to invest, despite them possibly giving advice that would cost their viewers money in the long run.\n\nFurther, some people find it fun to manage their own stocks. In this case, making money may not be the primary goal, but instead finding successful businesses and rooting for them, as a hobby is. Like most hobbies, this may cost money but it can be fun."

    "question": "https:\/\/twitter.com\/DanPriceSeattle\/status\/1309696726425628672\n\nRestaurant industry profit margins are very low, so it seems to me that any franchise paying this much would be bankrupt instantly.",
    "answer": "I was curious about this question so looked into it. First, based on research done by [Politifact](https:\/\/www.politifact.com\/factchecks\/2014\/sep\/03\/other-98\/can-you-make-45000year-mcdonalds-denmark\/), it looks like the average wage is about 2x in Denmark compared to the US, so let's put aside 3x.\n\nNote that relative prices (and wages) are tricky to determine, because of fluctuating exchange rates. Actually today a Big Mac in Denmark costs [less](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/274326\/big-mac-index-global-prices-for-a-big-mac\/) than a Big Mac in the US. About 7 years ago, though, the Euro was up to 20% higher and so was the cost of McDonald's food in Denmark. If we take a rough estimate of around 5% higher price under a \"normal\" exchange rate, we still have a lot of explaining to do to show how Denmark does it profitably.\n\nFor a fast food restaurant, labor costs are much less than half of total expenses. [This](https:\/\/smallbusiness.chron.com\/common-food-labor-cost-percentages-14700.html) industry publication says it is around 25-30% of total expenses (so does [this](https:\/\/www.7shifts.com\/blog\/restaurant-costs\/) one). Food cost is also around 30%. Other costs include real estate, equipment, management, marketing and utilities. The rest is profit (to oversimplify).\n\nSo, if labor cost goes up by 100% and revenue goes up by 5%, that creates a 20-25% pressure on the profit margin that has to be addressed. Apparently average margin for a franchise is 5-6% in the US.\n\nI think part of the problem here is the assumption that labor costs actually go up 100% in Denmark. With a middle-class wage, there is definitely a lot less turnover in Denmark and that reduces cost. Turnover is a huge problem in fast food restaurants, where [130% turnover](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/08\/29\/fast-food-restaurants-in-america-are-losing-100percent-of-workers-every-year.html) in a year is common. Turnover creates costs in hiring, training, and lost productivity. Just using the first web [source](https:\/\/www.peoplekeep.com\/blog\/employee-retention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee) I found on this, the average cost per instance of turnover is around $3,000, so at a rate of 130% that's around $4,000 per employee per year, which would raise the cost from around $20,000 annual labor cost for staff to $24,000. That doesn't count lost productivity, so Denmark restaurants can also probably make do with fewer employees on a shift, on average, for a given volume of orders.\n\nNow I'm spitballing, but if front line management is also paid better in Denmark and has a higher retention rate, then it too is likely to be more competent and efficient. This can translate into all sorts of other relevant changes, like lower presenteeism and less wasted food. While I haven't dug deep enough to put numbers to it, perhaps half of the total cost difference can be attributed to a higher quality, lower turnover workforce.\n\nThe only other thing that occurs to me is that McDonald's in Europe has a much higher volume per location than in the US (see annual [report](https:\/\/corporate.mcdonalds.com\/corpmcd\/investors-relations\/financial-information\/annual-reports.html) for US vs International data, which consists mostly of Europe). The revenue per restaurant is roughly double, so that also suggests greater efficiencies are possible in Europe, which probably shaves several more percentage points off the cost of operations."

    "question": "[Right now the USA has an unemployment rate - UR - of only 13.3%.](https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/business\/business-news\/unemployment-rate-falls-13-3-percent-economy-gains-surprise-2-n1223236) However, [according to the Washington Post, \"more than 40M people have filed for Unemployment Benefits.](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2020\/06\/04\/unemployment-claims-coronavirus\/) \n\nFinally, [according to FRB of St. Louis, there are 164.4M Americans in the workforce.](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CLF16OV) \n\nSo when I do the math, I see that we should be having a 24% Unemployment Rate in the USA. Why is it only 13.3%?",
    "answer": "First of all, unemployment benefits only count one side--people who have lost jobs. They don't count people who got jobs over that period of time. Second, the workforce no longer consists of 164M people. As you can see in the link you posted, it did consist of \\~164.5 million people in February, but as of May (the most recent figure), it includes about \\~158.2M people. This suggests that as some people lost their jobs, they simply chose not to look for work.\n\nThe most recent [Employment Situation report](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/empsit.nr0.htm) includes some more details:\n\n&gt; Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 2.5 million in May, and the unemployment rate  declined to 13.3 percent  \n&gt;  \n&gt; The unemployment rate declined by 1.4 percentage points to 13.3 percent in May, and the number of unemployed persons fell by 2.1 million to 21.0 million  \n&gt;  \n&gt; The labor force participation rate increased by 0.6 percentage point in May to 60.8 percent, following a decrease of 2.5 percentage points in April \n\nSo TL;DR, there isn't 40 million people unemployed, there is 21 million. And there isn't 164 million people in the labor force, there is 158.22 million. 21\/158.227 = 13.3% unemployment"

    "answer": "Not completely sure without the context, but here’s what I think he meant. Let’s say your company has a net worth of $1 billion. If you retain earnings equal to 10% of net worth every year, by year 10, your company’s net worth compounds to $1*(1.1)^10= $2.594 billion. Of that amount, $1 billion is attributable to allocation decisions made prior to those 10 years (since that’s what the company was worth at the beginning). Then, $2.594-$1=$1.594 billion dollars of worth was created by the allocation decision made by the CEO in the last 10 years. It happens that $1.594\/$2.594=61.45%."

    "question": "I’ve often heard that having a tax rate that is too high would negatively impact economic growth, but im somewhat confused as to exactly what the mechanism is. \n\nI’ve heard it argued that taxing the rich more will lead to less investment, but if the money is spent on redistribution to the poor\/middle class, shouldn’t it make up for that by giving rich people more money because those people will spend more on goods and services? \n\nI’ve also heard it argued that high taxes and subsequent spending would hurt economic growth because it would reduce the incentive to work, but I don’t really get that argument either. If people go from working say, 40 hours a week to 30 hours week, wouldn’t that not hurt growth but just hurt the total GDP? Like as long as labor gets more efficient shouldn’t growth still happen? \n\nAt the same time though, it seems impossible to me that we could just increase taxes on the rich forever without any downsides, so what gives as taxes go up?",
    "answer": "**TL;DR Earning more money is a significant incentive for working harder, longer and producing more outputs. Increasing income taxes reduces this incentive, and, all else being equal, we would expect people to work less hard, for less time and produce less. Because 'the economy' is just the aggregate of what people produce, less production means a smaller, slower-growing (or even contracting), economy.**  \n\n\nFirst, a caveat: the economics of tax policy is tricky! Why? Because understanding a given proposal often involves understanding how that policy might operate at the individual level ('how would introducing this tax affect my decision making?') and then aggregating this up to the whole-of-economy level. Even in isolation this is difficult, but introduce the complications of the actual real-world tax system, with different rates, deductions, types of income and types of earner, and it gets very complex indeed.\n\nLuckily the question you've asked is fairly straightforward, but i'm going to make some assumptions so I can give you a clearer answer (assumptions in brackets): how does increasing the (personal income) tax rate affect economic growth (all else being equal)?\n\n**Note**: the effect of higher rates of \\*other\\* taxes, like the corporate tax rate or consumption taxes, is different again!\n\n**Ok with that said, Incentives!**\n\nA lot of tax policy is about trying to understand how different types and rates of taxes affect people's incentives to save, work and spend. Let's start with a very simplified case study. \n\nEconomists tend to assume (there are exceptions) that we can expect people to be rational actors who attempt to maximise their utility subject to a set of constraints. People derive utility from having money (because it allows them to buy things), and they also derive utility from not working (because it allows them to have leisure time). We also assume that people make their decisions \\*at the margin\\*. For example, you might be willing to work 4 hours in a row for $20 an hour, but after 4 hours you're tired and cranky and ready for a break, so $20 is not enough to work the 5th hour. If the pay got upped to $40 an hour, however, you would be willing to work through your tiredness for hour number 5. \n\nTo pre-emptively address a common critique of economics by non-economists: yes, not everyone is rational or has the same incentives! But, on average across a whole economy, assumptions about people being rational actors *tends* to be true enough that it's predictive.\n\n**A simple economy**\n\nUsing this trade off between work and leisure, and our marginal willingness to work, we imagine people making decisions about how much to work. For simplicity, let's imagine I own my own pie business. I make pies at a rate of 1 pie per hour, and I sell those pies (let's imagine there is infinite demand for my pies so they always sell) for $20 per pie. I live at home, and all my food and housing is paid for by my parents, so I just work to have money to spend on things I like, like travelling and model trains.\n\nI might decide that 30 hours a week is the perfect balance between earnings and leisure time, and my contribution to the economy is 30 pies, in real terms, for which i'm payed $600. We could assume from this that, after 30 hours a week, the wage i would demand to work the 31st hour is more than $20!\n\n**Tax policy (gone wrong!)**\n\nNow let's imagine we increase income taxes. We want to be progressive, so we introduce a tax of 50% \\*only\\* on people earning more than $400 a week. This means that, after my first 20 pies, half of my marginal income is now paid in tax. \n\nNow, instead of being paid $20 for each extra hour that I work, after my first 20 hours i'm paid $10! I'm still pretty fresh after 20 hours of work a week, and I'd like a bit more than $400 in total, but i'm not going to work the full 30 hours - maybe I decide to work 25 hours. After 25 hours, i'm willing to keep working for $20 an hour, but $10 just seems too low.\n\nWhat happens to my contribution to the economy? Well I used to make 30 pies a week and now I make 25. If everyone in the economy is like me, on average, the result would be a roughly 15% decline in Gross Domestic Product! \n\n**Ok, but like, there is more to the economy than pie?**\n\nOur preceding example is very simple, but it demonstrates a basic mechanism behind the impact of higher income tax - by reducing the marginal returns to work, higher tax rates incentivise people to work less and hang out more. The higher the tax, the less the effective return for working an additional hour is, and the more likely people are to work less. \n\nYou can see that it rests on a few assumptions. In addition to the assumptions we laid out at the start, in my case study I can choose how much to work, don't need a certain amount of money to survive and face no uncertainty - I get paid hourly. \n\nMuch of the economy today is not like that - some people work jobs that are paid annual wages, others would work \\*more\\* if their wages went down in order to meet their minimum living requirements, and still others have salaries with large variable components like bonuses or performance targets. \n\nSome of these things reduce the effect of income taxes on work incentives, or even reverse them. But, on average: high income taxes mean lower incomes, lower incomes mean people face weaker incentives to work and produce. Even if the taxed income is redistributed by the government, the total pie ( ;) )  is still smaller than it would have been.\n\nDoes this mean we should have no taxes? Not at all - apart from anything else, the government uses tax revenue to provide many goods and services that are core to the modern economy, like infrastructure and education. Some trade-off of total GDP for equity is also totally reasonable. But we should understand what the trade-offs are, and how to reduce them. Some types of taxes are more distortionary than others, so we should decide on the level of redistribution that we want, and use the combination of taxes and spending to get there as efficiently as possible."

And not looking for some crappy communist capitalist slap fight either. More interested in extactive vs inclusive societies and how that may manifest in China's future.",
    "answer": "Acemoglu’s work doesn’t describe a binary — there aren’t just failed or successful states — a country’s institutions can fall on a spectrum of more or less inclusive. \n\nEg, maybe Sweden or wherever is extremely inclusive, Spain a little less so, Malaysia has serious flaws, and somewhere like Equatorial Guinea is a truly failed state. And each will reach some steady state economically — E. Guinea will have most people dirt poor until it has better institutions, Malaysia will be better off than most places but not truly rich, Spain will be rich but not as rich as it could be with better institutions, and Sweden will be somewhere near the top.\n\nChina went from having some of the worst institutions in the world, which caused mass famines, disease, suffering, and cultural destruction, to a place where most people can at least have a shot at an education, a modest wage, and can even maybe start their own business. Accordingly, they’ve gone from a dirt poor country to one that’s still fairly poor (gdp per capita is in the ballpark of Brazil or Mexico) but not destitute.\n\nMaybe it will get better institutions, maybe worse, but one might expect it to stay about the same. And it could plausibly stay that way for a long time, and be quite stable. \n\nMaybe economic success has some link to stability, but that doesn’t mean somewhere economically unsuccessful can’t be politically stable for a very long time. It’s not a ticking time bomb.\n\nAlso, just because of Chinas sheer population, even reaching moderate success economically gives the CCP enough resources to be a superpower.\n\nSo, it’s complicated, but there’s no reason to expect an implosion just on economics alone."

    "answer": "It largely has to do with the staff to child ratio and how much people pay for childcare.  For example in preschool there are often 2 teachers for 20 children.  Take any price point and see just how much revenue such a class makes... Let's say it's $1,000 \/ month as a round number. This is [slightly above average](https:\/\/www.care.com\/c\/stories\/2423\/how-much-does-child-care-cost\/) in the US, but costs vary regionally.\n\nSo, this is $20,000 in revenue per month if the 20-child class in at capacity. That's $240,000 per year in total revenue.  Two teachers means $120,000 in *revenue* for each teacher. If **all** the revenue went to the teachers that's the upper bound you'd expect.\n\nNow, from that you have to account for many other costs: materials (toys, books, art supplies, furniture), facilities (rent \/ mortgage), utilities (electricity, water, garbage, heating), other staff (reception, administration), other business costs (marketing, accounting, insurance...).\n\nSo, it's reasonable to expect child care centers can only pay the actual care givers in the range $20,000 - $40,000."

We liked one and did some negotiation &amp; now have a good price for it but I'm a bit sceptical because we found the agent online &amp; I've been scammed once before (It wasn't related to property &amp; wasn't a very big amount either but it was enough to make me paranoid)\n\nHere's some info on the flat:\nThe ones selling are the first owner of the flat. A little bit of their loan is still remaining which they will clear from the money we give.\n\nAny help would be very appreciated. Thank you!",
    "answer": "The banks have centralised catalogue of all the legal properties. If you go with SBI for your home loan then they BGC on the property\/ builder\/ scheme\/ land for all legal documents &amp; approvals.\nIn addition to that you should demand the true copy of existing sales deed and run it through your lawyer. From safe guarding point, always go for agreement registration with all typical safe guards &amp; preconditions that need to be satisfied before the execution of sales deed.\n\nFrom extra caution point, you should also investigate\/ enquire about the history\/ area of society about any issues ( noise, nasty neighbours, next door perpetually barking dog, problematic group accommodations with late night\/ week end troubles, next door leased service apartment, safety\/ crime rate, bad locality, health hazards \/ pollution, water logging, nearby hospital\/ crematorium \/ wine shop\/ school: all these good to have in the area but not next door!, legal status of internal open area of society\/ any new DP road plan cutting through the society premises etc..) and do structural\/ x_ray scanning from some engineer in case construction is old.\nAlso be very clear about additional stuff such as parking lot, water availability, any service &amp; maintenance dues from existing owner, issue getting NOC for sale from co- op society office\/ builder: many times they demand black payments to issue one &amp; this need to be sorted out before hand with the current owner, any legal dispute involving the flat\/society, any claims on same property by anyone else than the guy you are talking to, current name status of original electricity bill,  municipal  property tax receipt &amp; index II document( should be on current owner’s name)- also get it mentioned in agreement that owner will provide all required help and complete process of its transfer on your name with all dues paid beforehand. Also do demand and check original photo ID such as PAN, Passport, Aadhar etc. along with employment &amp; business details of owner at early stage. There is no need to be shy about these things as it’s a legal deal and it always pays to be assertive &amp; practical early than being sorry &amp; cheated later.\n\nAs a side concern, also do check if the property has any ‘vastu dosh ‘ e.g. main door facing south. Irrespective of whether you believe or not in these things, it makes reselling of such properties harder at right market price as many in India do believe in these things and avoid buying such homes. This may also be a good bargaining point if you are for long 15\/20 year plan of staying in that home and don’t personally believe in such things. It’s all about doing cost- benefit analysis at personal level.\n\n Most important is don’t give a single penny as part of the transaction which is unaccounted for in any legal binding and each payment lot need to be legally traceable and mentioned in registered agreement before the final deed. Scammers rely on any such unaccountable payments\/ advances to trap the buyers as no legal action can be taken for such cash\/ black payments. There are certain sellers who purely buy the property for short term profiteering and such people rely on these dirty tactics to exploit buyers as in many cases they do not have all legal documents ready with them as the property is very new and\/ or the owner wants to lock you down while he\/ she hunts for other buyer quoting higher ticket price than agreed with you. Don’t fall for BS like ‘behen ki shaadi’, ‘hospital ka Kharcha ’ etc. used by these people to convince you in giving any unsecured advance money. Once any cash\/DD\/cheque is paid, they start demanding more money, time for delaying the sales deed or increase\/ add black component for sale and refuse to return the paid advances\/ token amount giving excuses like the money is spent. The agreement should also mention time bound repayment of any advance payments in case deed is not executed with all conditions satisfied in stipulated time period ( typically 2\/3 months) post execution of an registered agreement.\n\nTo avoid most of these troubles, people hence prefer buying new flats (especially post RERA act) from reputed builders instead ( by giving due diligence to locality\/ surrounding factors mentioned in 2nd para above.)\n\nIt goes without saying that all above points are general suggestions and you should involve legal expert\/ lawyer during your transaction phase to be on a safer side."

    "question": "I'm from Argentina and every time I find myself talking about economics with someone who actually knows their stuff, they always tell me that globally Argentina is known as uniquely difficult to understand for foreigners when it comes to economic case studies. Is this true? Or is that just us wanting to feel special?",
    "answer": " The old saying is that there are four types of economies: Developed, Developing, Japan, and Argentina. \n\nI think this mostly has to do with the large amount of debt Argentina and Japan carry and for how long they've carried this relatively high leverage. In modern economics, it seems somewhat odd that this debt hasn't proven particularly unsustainable. The Japanese case mostly has to do with corporate and household savings rates (Japan being able to tax when they need to for revenue). Japan also uniquely seems to struggle with deflation because of these savings rates and currency speculation. \n\nI'm not as well read on Argentina, but one issue that has plagued Argentina for a long time is high inflation, although not hyperinflation like in Venezuela or Zimbabwe, just a relatively high inflation rate post-2000 (think 10%-50%). \n\nTLDR: Yes, Argentina (also Japan) are particularly interesting case studies in economics for a lot of economists."

    "question": "I keep hearing that a recession will happen due to inflation in the future and I'm getting worried some people are posting so many conflicting stories every day and all the time. I hear soft landings for the US economy I hear a second great recession I'm hearing it won't be until 2024\/25 it's all over the place and I'm so confused.",
    "answer": "We should almost have a FAQ about this...\n\nPredictions of a recession \/ boom \/ anything else are rarely worth reading. If you want forward looking metrics search for leading indicators, but know they are not perfect: https:\/\/www.conference-board.org\/topics\/us-leading-indicators\n\nAnyone able to predict the future path of the economy could make a lot of money doing so. Anyone publicly publishing those predictions would be forgoing that benefit... See who is publishing these predictions, what track record they have, what incentives they may be hiding, and then decide if it's worth reacting to their predictions (it almost never is).\n\nMost often the \"prediction\" that we are in a recession start to happen when we are already in one. This is because (by definition) we have need two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction... So whenever we have one quarter (note that 2022 Q1 real gdp was negative) then the predictions start flying fast and furiously (because what people are \"predicting\" is already half true) .\n\nThe reality is that the Fed started raising rates, so a deceleration in investment is expected. But this isn't news, it's something the Fed has announced publicly with a few months advance notice. *A slowdown is expected*. In fact, that's what the fed *wants*! But a slowdown and negative growth are different. Right now the best GDP predictors are all still positive for Q2. See for example: https:\/\/www.atlantafed.org\/cqer\/research\/gdpnow\n\nSo things are slowing, which is what we expect because that's how we reduce inflation. By the way, are the same people predicting recession also deriding inflation? If so they likely have more of a political agenda than an economic one.\n\nCOVID threw almost every historic model for a loop (models not built on data that includes a pandemic won't predict accurately how a pandemic effects the economy). There are a significant number of one time events in the past two years meaning people can justify almost any prediction they want to. Not just Covid, but the resulting stimulus, the TCJA, supply chain disruptions, net zero \/ negative interest rates, and more...\n\nPredicting macroeconomics is hard, and there's no punishment for getting it wrong. So it's safe to disregard the majority of what you read, they're more likely describing current conditions than future ones."

    "question": "Context for the question about price freezing:\n\n&gt; To control inflation, Argentina’s government imposed a 90-day price freeze on 1,245 mass consumer products. The information was released by the newspaper Clarín.\n&gt;\n&gt; Secretary of Commerce, Roberto Feletti, asked companies to send price lists by October 1st. Prices will remain unchanged for consumers until 7 January. The government’s expectation is to send a clear signal of price stabilization.\n&gt;\n&gt; The “3-month stabilization agreement” was presented by the secretary Feletti to 40 entrepreneurs this morning. They represent the main food and other foodstuffs factories.\n\nhttps:\/\/playcrazygame.com\/2021\/10\/14\/argentina-freezes-prices-on-1245-products-for-90-days\/",
    "answer": "&gt;What are the economic consequences we could expect and what are some successful examples of such policy?\n\nShortages. And a black market where prices still go up *anyway*.\n\nPrice controls don't work, especially in a country where inflation is this high. It's a bandaid, and a useless one as well. Ending long running and substantial inflation as we see in Argentina generally requires drastic policy changes and is generally a result of gross mismanagement. Which is often why it survives, incompetent leadership isn't suddenly going to change their ways, and incompetent leadership is not ready to take the at times drastic steps to stop such a trend."

    "answer": "Since I'm being criticized like I don't understand what a quality post here is supposed to look like, I'll give you an example:\n\nFirstly, I always post charts. If you're confused at to what you're looking at, this is called \"Technical Analysis\", and a lot of people think it is the equivalent to asset astrology. They might not be totally wrong. \n\nThe point is,  however, that these sort of charting principles are literally programmed into trading bots, and they perform *better than not having those factors included at all*.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about TA, go to school at babypips.com, and understand it like it would be explained to a 5th grader. \n\nSo first, let's look at a weekly chart of the ETH\/USD price dating back to the first bubble.\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lfBars0.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/lfBars0.jpg)\n\nThis is how far back we have to go to find relevant *support* and *resistance* levels. These are prices that the asset tends to gravitate towards, based solely on historical levels. When the price approaches a former gravity point, it is considered **resistance**, until it breaks through this. When prices approach from below these levels, it is considered a \"sell\" or \"short\" signal, until it breaks through (with a reasonable error).\n\nThese sorts of price targets tend to be more meaningful when there arent **fundamental** factors (like news, economics, politics,etc) that are influencing the price. More on this later, but fundamentals *always* trump technicals.\n\nSecondly, when a price breaks through resistance from below, that price point is now considered *support*. Based on that weekly chart. $850 was a frequent gravity point in what can be considered a giant head and shoulders pattern. That is your bottom \"long term\" support right now.\n\nResistance, here, is only the all time high. About $1450 depending on where you check. Expect there to be sell pressure here, based on nothing else except for the fact that it is the ATH. \n\nNow, for my *traders* on more frequent timeframes, let's take a look at the hourly chart:\n\n\n [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xAaAWnM.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/xAaAWnM.jpg)\n\nThis sort of uptrend channel is very very typical. You see how it behaves within the bounds for the most part? Yeah, that's because the algos are charting this shit based on the same trendlines I'm drawing.\n\nTypically, you get a \"sell\" or \"short\" signal when it breaks down out of this trendline pattern. Again, independent of fundamental factors, And youd start looking for temporary support\/resistance levels the same way we did on the weekly (only now on a shorter timeframe). \n\nDoing so puts me around $970 with a downside target:****\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Wi8QeHZ.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Wi8QeHZ.jpg)\n\nSo all that being said, hilariously, I'm basically now going to tell you that although all of that charting is a worthwhile exercise, that is *NOT* what is primarily driving this market.\n\nYa'll need to be listening to CNBC in the morning, and hearing the hype crypto is starting to generate again. Bitcoin has basically been characterized as a \"store of value\" asset on the order of gold, and its anti-inflationary properties are being touted as \"unparalleled\" in a time where the fed is literally printing money out if their asses. This run was very well predicted this past summer, because of just that.\n\nSo why is Eth a laggard to bítcoin???? This shouldnt be surprising at all. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, the name recognition, and it's in the mouths of the pundits on CNBC. It IS the digital gold.\n\nBut that isnt where the crypto story ends, obviously. The utility of the blockchain is kind of the entire point of the tech, not as a store of value. The applications it has in so many industries (banking, credit, notaries, contracts, conditional wire transfers, wills, the list goes on and on)  is why this shit popped off in the first place (and why Eth nearly surpassed BTC in market cap). It's what drove the second wave of hype the last time. Expect it to happen again.\n\nWhen the BTC market becomes saturated with exposure, expect Alts like Eth, OMG, LiteCoin, etc to dominate the \"Crypto talk\" news cycle, as investors who missed the BTC train scramble (again) to get exposure to the insane rally. \n\nThe difference is, ETH now has \"Proof of stake\" and a million other actual applications on its resume from the past couple of years, and this will **very very** clearly separate it from the pack. Eth is a $2000 coin, and very soon. Just watch to see the conversation move towards the principles I've described. \n\nSo the long and the short of this post. Buy and hold Eth now. This run is just getting started. If you want to trade on lower timeframes, go read up on TA and post charts\/news. That is super fun and I love to see people doing that. It's a healthy market to have short sellers and traders. \n\nThis is obviously a very long post, but the details I mentioned here is what comments should be based around here; not simply reaction to every little price move. \n\nHope this can be an example of how to  make this forum a better place."

    "question": "Dear investors, i wish you a good day.\n\nI started investing in November 2017 and before i realised what was happening, my super fast gains ended in a bursting bubble and a year of decreasing prices.

    "answer": "I am still way up from my initial investment as I got into crypto early 2016 when prices were crazy low but definitely down a lot on potential profits. I mean at peak Jan valuations, I literally had fuck you money on paper but now it feels like a distant dream again. I did cash out quite a bit in late Dec which is probably why I am still sane. I should have cashed out everything but hindsight is a bitch.\n\nI can only imagine how hard it would have been if I invested during the bubble and had to experience 95% of my money going down the drain. It takes a lot of character and strength to hold yourself together in these tough times, especially if you have invested significant sums like me. So hats off to the newbies who invested in Jan and are still here and holding strong despite the massacre. If you can make it through this bear, you can make it through anything in future.\n\nI know wisdom says you should only invest what you are willing to lose but in my case, I didn't have much that I could lose. So I invested money that I couldn't afford to lose because I knew that you can only get rich by taking exceptional risk when you werem't born with a silver spoon. I was willing to tough it out for a few years and live like a beggar if things didn't work out. I mentally prepared myself for the hard life but thankfully it did work out."

    "question": "I am trying to understand how cryptocurrencies have value. I always thought money had value because you can translate it back to gold or silver, and this made cryptocurrencies look like an absolute joke thing. In university i took a basic economic class and there i found out that we dropped the gold standard a long time ago. I was taught that the money we use today has value because people trust it has value and trust that people will accept it as a currency, and the demand for it determines its worth. Is this true? Could someone just clarify it a little bit, maybe with an example? I don't think i understand it well enough. And if i am off my rails, please correct me.",
    "answer": "Yes, for \"normal\" fiat money this is definitely true.\n\nBasically, $10 have the value of $10 because you can buy $10 worth of goods with them. $10 worth of bananas, or screws, or Pokémon cards, or weed, or whatever. You could buy the same stuff for the same $10 tomorrow and you could have done the same yesterday.\n\nPeople have faith in the USD being stable and reliable and that faith is verified every day because every day people go out and spend USD and get the value they expect.\n\nWhile the USD isn't technically backed by anything, you could look at it in the sense of being \"backed\" by the entire US economy because all the USD out there can buy all the goods and services offered in the US.\n\nCryptocurrencies behave differently. Their value doesn't come from your ability to freely and reliably exchange them for goods and services.\n\nThere are basically two angles you can take.\n\nFirst, you could say that *today*, no you can't purchase a lot with them, but you will be able to in the future, once they take hold in the economy and become widely used an accepted. They still have value because of their ability to purchase goods and services, it's just that the point where they have that ability lies in the future.\n\nOr you could say, well it's a bubble. It has value because people think it does and think it will gain value over time. Of course if it never actually has any \"real\" value, the bubble will eventually collapse and cryptocurrencies will return to their \"real\" value, which is nothing.\n\nThe truth lies probably somewhere in between those two extremes. Really, we don't know yet. At least some cryptocurrencies certainly *could* become useful currencies in the future, we don't know yet."

It’s my understanding they’re past the pandemic (or so they say) so exporting goods shouldn’t have any effect no?\n\nThanks everyone for your knowledge.",
    "answer": "It's a complicated question. A short answer might includes things like:\n\n1. Supply chain hiccups in various intermediate components and raw materials during the pandemic leading to shortages in finished goods, driving up prices\n2. Poorly managed health risks in workplaces and reduced availability of things like suitable child care have reduced the available labor pool of people willing to work for lower wages; this hasn't seemed to raise wages yet but reduced labor availability can lead to reduced output and shortages\n3. (controversial\/dubious) stimulus payments and increased UI benefits may have reduced the opportunity cost of not working, further reducing labor supply\n4. demand spikes from relaxed restrictions\n5. aggregate effects of stimulus policies reaching markets for consumer goods\n6. it just might *seem* like prices are skyrocketing now just because inflation has been so low for so long\n\nAnd FWIW, most lumber is produced domestically or in Canada, and most to all of P&amp;G's diapers for the US market are produced domestically too. The recent gas spike is likely at least partially a result of the Colonial pipeline cyberattack causing supply shortfall and uncertainty."

    "question": "This isn't a bash thread, I've been seeing a lot of \"just starting out\", \"where should I put my first $1000\", etc and I'm genuinely curious why you're looking to start out in dividend stocks?  Why not invest in growth stocks\/ETFs that hold them and then when you hit your goal, sell and move into dividend stocks?   Even reinvesting the dividend probably won't get you to your goal passive income stream as fast as just investing in ETFs\/index funds and then moving into dividend stocks.  Again, not hating on dividend stocks myself, I own 10k in QYLD\/O\/T in my Roth with them reinvesting (once they get back in the green I'm probably going to move them into VOO\/VTI), but my question is why is your portfolio starting out in dividend stocks?",
    "answer": "Basically I have a monkey brain, and having a passive income stream makes me happier than the logical benefit of having growth stocks. Even selling a periodic amount of my growth stocks each month\/quarter\/year doesn't do it for me. I want hands off, hands free passive income straight to my dome.   \n\n\nI feel like each person is pre-disposed to a certain type of investing, and as long as you aren't taking your savings to the casino, you can save and invest in many ways and still be successful."

So wouldn’t the market price of rent pretty quickly adjust to the new normal?\n\nAnd wouldn’t the same principle apply to many things in the economy?",
    "answer": "It depends on how you finance it.\n\nIf you finance it via money creation, you get higher inflation.\n\nIf you finance it via redistribution, e.g. taxes, you don't necessarily end up with inflation. You will get higher demand for some goods and it's perfectly possible that goods bought by poor(er) people will go up in price. That doesn't mean you get a (significant) increase in the general price level."

    "question": "From a historical perspective is capitalism “real”?\n\nIn an economics course I took a few years ago, one of the things talked about was that many economists, and some economic historians, have largely ditched terms like “socialism”, “communism”, “capitalism”, etc because they are seen as imprecise. What was also discussed was that the idea of distinct modes of production are now largely seen as incorrect. Economies are mixed, and they always have been. \n\nI know about medievalists largely abandoning the term “feudalism”, for example. So from a historical &amp; economic perspective, does what we consider to be “capitalism” actually exist, or is that the economy  has simply grown more complex? Or does it only make sense in a Marxian context?\n\nI’m not an economic historian by training so I’m really rather curious about this",

    "question": "To all economists out there, I'm starting to learn more about economics but there are some lessons that I struggle with because of lack of examples and sometimes I'm having a hard time understanding it. Hoping you guys would share some simple examples about my question. Thanks a lot",
    "answer": "A good current example is how some countries are subsidizing gasoline and\/or natural gas (or price ceilings) in Europe at a time when there are supply decreases. Sounds great! Something is more expensive, magically make it less expensive! However, a subsidy is a negative tax, artificially increasing demand just when you are worried about people using \"too much\" of something causing price spikes. Right now supply is very inelastic, so the only way out is to allow the price increases to decrease quantity demanded.\n\nInstead of subsidizing the exact things that are temporarily more scarce, if you are worried about the effect on poor people, you should give them money.  This lessens the shock to these people, and at least gives them a chance of spending the money on a substitute good (perhaps they will buy a heat pump instead of using natural gas to heat their houses)."

Is this paper reliable? \n\nOn one hand, I'm generally sceptical of claims that big and that grandiose. On the other hand, it seems like a legit paper (and it has over 700 citations)\n\nThanks in advance!",
    "answer": "As others have said, the paper is reliable in the sense it reflects academic consensus. But modelling on situations that have never happened before should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nIf every nation suddenly opened their borders, there would probably be a net benefit to GDP. Would the benefit to GDP be 50 to 150%? Maybe. Its only a best guess.\n\nYou also have to reflect on how different cohorts of the population are affected. The poorest in the world would benefit the most being able to move to richer countries to work. Some of the existing poor in richer countries might suffer because of the massive influx in competition for menial labour. And of course, capital would benefit a lot fuelling inequality.\n\nIn that sense, it would probably just be like globalisation on steroids. Massive boosts to GDP and decreases in absolute poverty but with great increases in inequality, communities torn apart etc.\n\nAnd then there are the unexpected consequences...\n\nEdit: Changed the wording to remove some of the certainty around the existing poor being harmed by immigration. There is mixed evidence on this point."

    "question": "I'm a socialist (or, some flavour of one) and I often hear people try to blame all of Africa's problems on the west and the legacy of colonialism. But I have my doubts about this. So what are the accepted explanations among economic theory and research for the poverty of Africa relative to Europe (and North America and the West Pacific)",
    "answer": "There is no one answer to this. In my own studies of the cultural reasons I mainly came across the \"extractive institutions\" approach of Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson and the effects of slavery empirically studied by Nunn.\n\nYes, I agree that it **may** be naive to think that colonialism accounts for the entire discrepancy between wealth across continents. However, it would be just as naive to think that it has not played a significant role. Institutions play a large role in the long-term wealth of a nation. If, for some reason, western colonialists installed more exploitative institutional systems in Africa compared to in North America, this effect can persist for a long time. I have read several hypotheses on why different institutional systems may be installed by colonialists but the factor that seemed most credible to me is the preexisting conditions for Europeans to settle in the colony.\n\nGoing down the slavery route, Nunn found that, within Africa, countries exhibit less trusting cultures if more slaves had been \"stolen\" during 1400-1900. African slaves were mostly captured by fellow Africans and possibly even friends and relatives. Culture persists through generations and it is not controversial to believe that less trust is detrimental to growth. Just imagine allocating capital efficiently in a society where the lenders don't trust the borrowers.\n\nEdit: Typo in controversial."

    "question": "Our population has barely grown, and we continue to add new homes.  Yet housing prices are up nearly everywhere.  I might expect this in San Francisco.  But Cleveland?  Pittsburgh?  I know individuals with 50 to 75 homes they rent.  Is that business model radically distorting the market?  Most people I know with “typical” jobs are in the $10-12\/h range, not enough to pay a $2,000\/month rent.  So, where is this heading?",
    "answer": "The issue isn't so simple so that you can just take total supply and population. Each state, county, and metro area have different zoning and land regulations which can influence housing price. Furthermore, housing is a heterogeneous good, meaning they are all different. It also doesn't change the fact that real income change and costs of living are different in each state. Furthermore, the consumers of housing can vary. \n\nThe consumers of housing have different preferences. There are factors such as different household sizes, age groups, martial status, and income. Preferences for apartments, condos, row housing, single family, can all affect housing prices. \n\nWhile we would like to simplify the problem of housing, its a field where planners and economists spend a great deal of time trying to figure out the problem.

Everybody seems to talk about \"investing\" in stocks and\/or crypto. Kinda **foollish** to think that I am not a part of the mob driven by trends too. Although I tend to consider myself as a \"value investor\" with long-term horizon (however, nowadays who doesn't).\n\nThere is a reason for equity price to inflate so much (QE \/ helicopter money \/ low interest rate etc), but boy, it's not a healthy way for society to have so many market participants chasing short-term gains.",
    "answer": "&gt;How was the market sentiment back then?\n\nI've been investing since 1992.  The market was very different back then.  Except for the 1998-1999 dot com, there really was not the wide-spread mania behind stocks for most normal folks.  Trading costs were a lot higher (a discount brokerage commission was $10 a lot, and options trades were much higher, $25-35 a trade minimum).  We didn't have widespread social media focused on investments now (there were some niche AOL, Compuserve, and usenet groups, but they didn't attract millions of users).\n\nSo, today's mania is different from what I've seen in my lifetime, which is very widespread gambling by people without much means, fueled by huge wins on social media (hello, Roaring Kitty), and enabled by easily available information and very low trading costs.  On top of that, long-term bond rates are the lowest they've been in my lifetimes, so otherwise conservative investors are putting most of the investment into equities.\n\n&gt;it's not a healthy way for society to have so many market participants chasing short-term gains\n\nWhether it's healthy or not remains to be seen.  People will always chase what they see as an easy route to riches.  In the US, it just happens to be stock, most other countries, it's real estate.  In some ways, today's environment is good for the average investor with much better investment disclosures, the internet, cheap trading costs, and amazing liquidity in ETF's and options.   It's the current valuation environment that is poor, but that can change very quickly."

    "question": "I was told by r\/AskHistorians this question is more fitted for economics, so please forgive me if this question is too history related.\n\nI recently started to wonder through all farming slaves did (the crops, cotton, etc). through all the transportation, and buildings slaves labored at. (ex: white house ). Through what little slavery did for the economy and capitalism in America( from what I heard slavery wasnt really better for the economy but i may be wrong). Through everything the slaves did before the conclusion of the civil war, what did they contribute?\n\nBasically, would America be where it is today if it weren't for slavery? Or was their impact on America's success too minuscule?",
    "answer": "There's two versions of this question: what did African Americans contribute and how would that contribution have been different if they were paid as free labour, not slaves. I'm going to address the second question, as I have some sources to hand. \n\nFor a start, clearly the American economy, outside the southern States, continued to prosper after its Civil War. Even the classic slave produced good, cotton continued to be produced in rising numbers. US cotton exports continued after the civil war. The US's Federal Reserve in [May 1923 published an article on cotton financing](https:\/\/fraser.stlouisfed.org\/files\/docs\/publications\/FRB\/1920s\/frb_051923.pdf). As part of this, they discussed cotton exports, and published a table (page 567 or 33 in the pdf), showing cotton exports of 1.9 million bales in 1850 and 2.9 million bales in 1870, rising up to a high of 10.7 million bales in 1911.\n\nAnd this was despite a drop in labour inputs: The end of slavery *is* estimated to have resulted in newly freed cotton workers reducing their labour supply by up to a third (as an aside, in and amongst the various miseries of the Black experience in the US South I like to dwell on this good news - that emancipated people gained that improvement in their lives). Interestingly, cotton productivity relative to labour is estimated to have gone up during this period despite the fall in hours worked: the hours of labour required to produce a 100 lb of cotton lint was estimated at 82 in 1860 and 68 in 1870 (Craig and Weiss, 2000, page 8): cotton pickers may have been working fewer hours, but they were working more efficiently.\n\nUS cotton did have an advantage in world markets independent of slavery: a particular variety of cotton, G. hirsutum, made for very nice cotton and US slaveholders developed varieties that grew particularly well in the climate and soil conditions of the US south (Olmstead and Rhode, 2008). Adapting this variety to other primary cotton-growing regions of the world, was a much slower process.\n\nThe other side is that US industrialision started in the northern states, where slavery was illegal. There are long arguments about whether the industrialisation was financed by cotton, or perhaps cotton was a retardant. The question of US industrialisation is why did the US industrialise rather than remain a primary producer like Canada or Australia or NZ, focused on trading agricultural and mining products to Europe in exchange for manufactured goods? One argument is the US's tariffs, introduced to protect US manufacturers. If it had not been for exports of slave-produced goods like cotton or tobacco, then the US$ real exchange rate would have presumably been higher against the European currencies, providing a similar incentive to domestic manufacturing.\n\nFinally, slavery was by its nature a violent and destructive process, naturally prompting resistance by its victims. Given the evidence that social trust is important for economic prosperity, slavery's legacy plausibly continues to reduce economic output today. \n\n**Sources**\n\nRansom, Roger. “Economics of the Civil War”.

    "question": "To my limited understanding, Sweden has nailed their economic model – they manage to sustain a high-innovation, socially-supportive economy that I think should be the model for America and elsewhere.\n\nAs I understand it, this is the result of mechanisms that include:\n\n* High income and consumption taxes, with substantial government spending allocated towards free healthcare and education\n* Incentives for entrepreneurship (inc. paid leave of absence to start a company)\n* Low taxes on capital (wealth, property, inheritance)\n\nMy question is in the title: Why do they prefer income and consumption taxes to taxes on capital (are they intending to incentivize entrepreneurship, or is this not the explanation)?  And does this have downstream effects for inequality (Sweden seems to have a pretty low Gini coefficient)?",
    "answer": "People get confused over capital income taxation. Consumption taxation schemes like X tax end up looking almost identical to corporate income tax schemes, but the key difference is that consumption taxes have a constant implicit rate with respect to time while capital income taxes do not. **This is an extremely disireable property** and its why many countries prefer consumption taxation. This is not an easy thing to grasp but once you understand this distinction I think it becomes a lot more clear how it's possible for consumption taxes to be progressive. \n\n[My comment here goes over the difference in detail](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/badeconomics\/comments\/huy7cu\/the_single_family_homes_sticky_20_july_2020\/fyviv02?context=1).\n\nA benefit that is not covered by that comment is about tax enforcement. Basically it's much more difficult for the wealthy to avoid taxes if the tax code is simplified. Some economists argue that you need to have a ton of different \"tax gateways\" to prevent the wealthy from slipping through the cracks of the tax code. I find this argument uncompelling. It's much easier for the IRS to be lazer focused on enforcing taxes on a small number of cash flow sources rather than trying to tax income at a bunch of disparate points. The benefits will be nontrivial because of chronic underfunding. If you can afford accountants to navigate the complex tax system, then you'll end up avoiding paying some of the taxes that normal people will pay."

    "question": "According to the film \"The Big Short\", many economists and banks think that the housing bubble burst won't happen because \"who doesn't pay their mortgage?\" Why did economists-- including Alan Greenspan-- think there won't be a housing crisis? I get that one of the points the film has mentioned is that there hasn't been a housing bubble burst in history and people have become complacent, but it seems naive to think that that will never be the case, especially that there have been alarms raised by other economists before?",
    "answer": "Housing prices have been increasing for a long time, even if you adjust for inflation. This is true not just in the US, but in most of the developed countries. Here is a time series of a house-price index in the US https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CSUSHPINSA\n\nThere are many contributing factors. I will name a few. \n\n- Population keeps growing but the amount of land stays the same. Although there are other important factors in the short run (such as income and interest rates), population dynamics play an important role. https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/aer.104.4.1172\n- Technological progress can help build taller and cheaper apartment buildings, but it cannot help us build more detached homes with big yards in zone-regulated suburbia. Zoning laws greatly restricts the housing supply https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/000282805774669961 a counter argument to this is that high speed rails and remote working might reduce the importance of living close to your workplace. \n- Globalization and the development of countries that used to be poorer has increased the demand for housing in North America and Europe. This is both coming from people who buy property for personal use, and for international investors that are happy to hold vacant property as a form of investment. \n- Some people use their residence as their primary form\ninvestment. Which makes sense given that the capital gains on your residence are usually tax free or have tax advantages https:\/\/uctpmcg.github.io\/WebsiteData\/OldAgeSavingsandHousePriceShocks_McGee2021.pdf\n\nIn fact, if you look at the graph I posted, housing prices are increasing at a faster rate right now than they were right before the 2008 crisis. The low interest rates and high construction costs during the pandemic have greatly contributed. Do you think we are in a bubble right now? \n\nEven if you believe you are in a bubble, it is difficult to predict whether it will pop soon or not. Do you think housing prices will collapse soon when the interest rates raise again and the supply chain issues go away? These things are always difficult to predict. \n\nAfter losing a lot of money trying to ride a financial bubble Isaac Newton famously said “I can predict the motions of the heavenly bodies but not the madness of people”. \n\nInterestingly, even the popping of soap bubbles war very difficult to predict until recently https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/full\/10.1126\/science.1230623?"

    "answer": "Robots do not always kill jobs. In general, they can be complementary or competitive to labour as a production input. Robots and automation increase productivity - meaning more can be produced with no change in the supply of labour. If demand is constant, this can result in lower prices (and loss of jobs if technology is sufficiently labour-replacing). If demand is increasing, higher productivity and higher demand for labour are both possible.\n\nIn global markets, the extra production can be exported and bring profits\/wealth into the country. Being the most productive means being able to produce more than others with fewer inputs - meaning profits can be achieved at lower prices. As Rob already pointed out, there is no reason to think that technology has a negative effect on labour demand in the long run. It can create short-term issues in particular industries or sectors, but at a national level, robotic density says more about the technological state of society than it does about employment."

    "question": "Russia has kept their stock exchange closed through all of last week, and has announced it will be kept closed today and tomorrow at the very least too.\n\nHow long can Russia seriously keep their exchange closed before they have no choice but to open it? And what are the consiqences for the country for keeping it closed indefinately?",
    "answer": "So long as the exchange itself desires to stay closed, potentially forever. The longest closure I can think of was the NYSE which shut for 4 months at the start of the Great War in Europe.\n\nUltimately, nothing can *force* the exchange open so long as the laws of Russia allow it to remain shut or the institutions there do not actively try to open them regardless of the law.\n\nIn terms of issues, the Russian stock market loses a huge amount of liquidity. Confidence in business steadily drops because now issuing shares (and thus a huge source of funding) is far more difficult, and the security provided from having easy and rapid access to sales for investors in the secondary market means they are much more worried about the safety of their money. It also means anyone relying on the price of assets listed in the exchange is not able to get new information. This informations is effectively frozen to when the exchange was last open."

    "question": "I don't know the numbers or degrees, but I know that economic downturn certainly harms human life, and isn't just 'about the money'. Unemployment raises death rates for sure, right? And I'm sure other people die due to decreases in goods and services available. It's also not like quality of life counts for nothing, and bad economic times clearly hurt quality of life for many people, and may also shorten life expectancy for some. Long story short: Depression also bad, yes? \n\nSo, it seems clear to me that our actual goal is to balance the interests - preventing the disease from harming people, and preventing the economic contraction from harming people - in the way that does the least damage overall. How is it more 'compassionate' to ignore the consequences of the economic component, when it does real damage as well? \n\nAm I missing something in this reasoning? And if not, do we have some vague idea about where the balancing point is in all this?",
    "answer": "Economists do take this into account, because people make trade-offs with safety all the time. There are different ways to calculate, but mostly, it comes down to how much people are willing to spend to reduce the odds of them dying by some percentage; so if a new regulation is expected to save a life but cost $100 million, it probably wont pass. If it costs a million, it will. This isn't the literal value of a human life. If a baby is down a well, they'll be saved regardless of the cost.\n\nHowever, by any reasonable estimate of the statistical value of human life, social distancing is a good [investment](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w26867) as left unchecked, Covid-19 is very likely to overwhelm the health care sector and keep vulnerable people out of the workforce. The proportion of people who are vulnerable increases with infections, because there are only so many resources, namely ventilators, available. \n\nA lot of people are claiming there's a trade-off between growth and letting large numbers of people die. The vast majority of leading economists [dispute that we are facing this trade-off right now](http:\/\/www.igmchicago.org\/surveys\/policy-for-the-covid-19-crisis\/). Indeed,  when social distancing was used with the 1918 Pandemic, areas that used distancing less had higher mortality rates *and* [took longer for their economies to recover](https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3561560)."

    "question": "I've never liked tipping just because plenty of companies make billions from the service they provide, and I think they should be the ones paying more. It's the business that takes advantage of the employees, the customer, and possibly other businesses. This happens with ride-sharing apps, delivery apps, restaurants, bars, you name it. Oftentimes these businesses charge pretty dang high too. So why make the customers pay twice for the service? Also, why do people think it's rude not to tip?",
    "answer": "I grew up in a country where nobody tips as a matter of course (tips can be left, but they're completely discretionary, not expected.)\n\nSo moving to the US was definitely a culture shock, since tips here consists of a \"baseline tip\" (the \"If you can't afford to tip here you can't afford to be here\" portion) and a \"merit tip\" that can be added on top of the baseline tip which is what other countries would actually treat as the entire tip.\n\nIt's toxic in several ways, but here are just two that annoy me:\n\nBecause it's an expected part of the compensation, employers consistently underpay their workers to pocket the difference themselves. The minimum wage for tipped workers is only $2.13\/hr, which enshrines that dishonest business practice into law.  \nSince employers don't pay a living wage to tipped workers and workers have to rely on tips to survive, tippers don't just reward workers, but can also punish workers by withholding their baseline tip, a concept completely absent in other countries.  \n\nThat last part is why it's problematic to not tip at least the baseline tip. Yes the system is bad, but not tipping that baseline tip only punishes the workers that already have no power over that system."

    "question": "Since all the other streaming services have come online I don't really see anything that sets Netflix apart other than they were first. I wouldn't actually be able to tell which one I am watching aside from the branding. \n\nThey have also lost a lot of content due to all the other services such as Disney starting.\n\nDoes a company necessarily need a Moat to be successful?",
    "answer": "I cover the industry for a living. Netflix's churn rate is far better than every other service (around 2% a month).\n\nYou think empty nesters are gonna keep Disney+? That service has a built-in plateau of families and the birth rate in the U.S. is dropping. Even if Hulu gets incorporated once Disney can reclaim its share from NBCU, the adult content is significantly lacking. \n\nPeacock is a joke. Paramount+ is showing life, but they're years behind. HBO Max is great, but they are very slow to release new content and who knows what happens when the Discovery boss takes over? Apple TV+ has excellent stuff, but it's too slow to drop new content. Prime Video has blockbusters alongside unwatchable zero-budget trash and its UI is a nightmare. \n\nNetflix doesn't have to worry about filling a broadcast slate or dealing with theatrical windows. It may not have the IP of some others, but how much longer are we going to ride superheroes and Star Wars? Those fans have already signed up to the services that have them. \n\nNetflix moves the needle like no one else. Squid Game and Tiger King cost next to nothing. They have a firehose of content and stuff for every demo. \n\nI'll grant that other services do movies better, but that's because most have theatrical runs with A-list talent in front of and behind the camera. Netflix is getting better at feature-length films. \n\nIt's not the moat it once was, but it's still there. Investors know what they signed up for. Compare that to AT&amp;T shareholders, who may not care about HBO Max or ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) shareholders who threw up when they heard how much would be spent on streaming programming. \n\nI believe one or more of these services folds in the next 5 years. And Netflix will still be standing."

    "question": "I’m not saying that these other countries didn’t grow at all, but compared to China it’s not much. I know that manufacturing was the prime reason why chinas economy grew, but why would they choose China specifically?  From what I’ve heard it was because the communist government lessened restrictions to allow companies to manufacture and invest in China, but why would they choose to manufacture in China as opposed to other nations which were open for investment before China opened its markets? Or why couldn’t they just spread out manufacturing across all Asian countries instead of basing most of it in China?",
    "answer": "for india specifically you can check this [oecd paper](http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/economy\/growth\/46866991.pdf) &amp; references therein. Main constraints seems to be institutional like employment protection regulation which requires any firm with over 100 employees seek govt permission for layoffs this (a) prevents intersectoral labor reallocation (b) prevents firm expansion &amp; exit. There are also other distortions like \n\n(1) 80% of the employment is in mico enterprises of &lt;10 people - these super small firms cannot increase mfg productivity.\n\n(2) high capital intensity in mfg firms even when unit labor costs are lower than capital costs. This prevents large labor absorption into mfg sector and hence a Lewis style structural transformation. \n\n(3) almost no labor mobility among rural &amp; urban workers possibly due to EPL regulation (also studies indicate loosening EPL regulation results in larger productivity gains at a state level). lower mobility also reduces the speed of poverty reduction since workers cannot move from shrinking sectors into expanding ones.\n\n(4) high number of state owned firms which are grossly mismanaged &amp; even partial privatization leads to efficiency gains.\n\n(5) in absence of formal welfare state \/ social insurance mechanism poor people rely on [caste based social insurance system ](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w14850)which further lowers labor mobility because by moving to a different area you loose caste based social insurance.\n\n(6) in the pre reform period capital intensive industries were given massive state support and post reform capital intensive industries persist (there is no single paper showing this but a [comprehensive review of the existing evidence](https:\/\/pubs.aeaweb.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1257\/jel.49.4.1152) points in this direction) \n\n&gt;\"Why has Indian growth created much less employment in its nonfarm sectors than have China and other Asian countries that also experienced fast growth?

    "question": "I was listening to economist Thomas Sowell (who is African American himself), who claims that black poverty in the U.S. fell by 40% from 1940 to 1960, but this drop began slowing after Lyndon Johnson unveiled his Great Society program in the 60s, and poverty rates have remained relatively constant since then. \n\nSowell claims welfare programs increased single-parent households among blacks in the U.S., which in turn led to increased poverty and impeded black progress in America.  \n\nAre welfare programs and single parent households indeed to blame for poverty? Or are there other factors that he is overlooking?",
    "answer": "I would be curious to see his sources. I couldn't find anything on Black poverty going back before 1959. However, [from the census](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/library\/stories\/2020\/09\/poverty-rates-for-blacks-and-hispanics-reached-historic-lows-in-2019.html) (from the first graph), the largest five year drop in percentage of Black people living in poverty came from 1965-1970, or in other words, immediately after LBQ introduced the Great Society programs.

    "question": "I recently became a millionaire this past month at the age of 29, but realized that my life has not materially changed in any way. I still have to continue going to my day job as I can't afford to live off my investments in my HCOL area. I've done some calculations and my fatFIRE number is 7-8M. I would be able to live very comfortably on that number and could splurge  here and there but I would still need to budget. With inflation, that number could be 10M when I turn 40 in a decade. This is also assuming that I stay single and\/or have no kids in the future.\n\nGrowing up, being a millionaire was always viewed as extraordinary accomplishment and it still is, but today a million dollars doesn't take you very far. The term millionaire was created in the 1700s or 1800s. Adjusted for inflation, a million dollars in 1900 would be worth around 30M today.

The ability to secure 5x (more if you're willing to live there for a year) leverage on an asset that's not likely to sting you for doing so.\n\n2.) Depreciation - usually your cash flow is largely untaxed.\n\n3.) Amortization - in addition to your cash flow, your mortgage is being paid off each month\n\n4.) Appreciation - not the main appeal for me, just assume it will follow inflation (this year was a nice bonus, though)\n\nA super-simplified example of a deal I would take is something like $30,000 cash to close and $200 in cash flow per month. 8% returns, not bad... but everyone forgets the amortization. As I pay off the mortgage each month, I'm also gaining equity. On a $140,000 house, you're looking at about another $200 per month of principal pay down. Now we're looking at 16% ROI. And it's usually untaxed.\n\nReal estate investing is way more work than the stock market. Nobody would do it (I certainly wouldn't) if the returns weren't better."

    "answer": "Microfinance. In the 90's and early-mid 2000s it was all the rage and many saw it as a panacea that was going to lift the poorest of the poor out of poverty. If only people had access to credit, they could invest in their businesses and pull themselves up. The problem was that poor people have no collateral, so there's no way to make sure they pay the loans back. So some microfinance pioneers like Mohammad Yunus (Nobel prize winner) came up with the idea of using social capital as collateral. By giving loans to many people in the same village, and making additional loans contingent on everyone paying back the initial loan, social pressures will make sure the loans get repaid. After all, nobody wants to be a social pariah and the reason their neighbor can't get additional loans for the business. They also gave the loans specifically to the women of the village, because data shows that women are a lot more likely to invest the money in their family, rather than just consume it, and [much more likely to repay the loans](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0305750X10002330?casa_token=TbShxsgnrjgAAAAA:Cu4SvsRGc5sr8j-MbBT1vPpH4It2xCKpw7BR-oAZR4V7wP_X9oDAOQox-MwtZST8BrBJ5isykrg).\n\nTurns out it doesn't always work so great. Access to credit leads people to take risks that they wouldn't ordinarily do so, and perhaps aren't well suited for. Businesses are started by people that cannot manage them or do not have the tools to be successful. When they go bankrupt and cannot repay the loans, the entire village is punished, which has obvious social implications.  [The UK government funded a synthesis study in 2010](https:\/\/eppi.ioe.ac.uk\/cms\/Portals\/0\/PDF%20reviews%20and%20summaries\/MICROFINANCE_WEB%2019March11.pdf?ver=2011-03-25-130509-613) that details a lot of the problems that were unforeseen. \n\nThis is not to say that microfinance is all bad. It simply isn't a panacea and must be implemented very carefully. Access to credit and the banking system is really critical for giving poor households the ability to save money, manage economic or other shocks, and get loans needed to start businesses."

    "question": "I used to own VZ but got out of it because I was a new investor and the volatility was too stressful for me at the time. Now that I know a little more, I've been thinking about jumping back in. And let's face it, we are approaching a 52 week low. But why is this dropping like this? It seems like with all of the activity going on within the company (5g, the Tracfone deal, partnerships with Disney &amp; Apple, etc) that the stock would be going in the other direction. What am I missing here?",
    "answer": "VZ is a stock that that trades like a bond. It's 10 year price channel has a average growth rate of 4% a year, so considering the dividend return it is pretty average market perform (although severely underperformed in the past two years). I have \\~8% of my portfolio in VZ, it does not generate any alpha but it is a good stable anchor from its ultra low volatility.\n\nRegarding your comment, VZ is a *value stock*. It is cheap relative to what it offers in terms of PE\/EBITA\/cashflow, because the company is mature and in a stagnation. If you scroll back on the chart to 1999, you will see that VZ was trading at an ATH of 64$ (which it has never broken). Back then this was a *growth stock*, was reporting crap PE\/EBITA\/cashflow but those numbers were increasing by high double digits every year. There is a place in your portfolio for both but the latter has to be traded.\n\nNow is a great time to be accumulating VZ since the stock price is depressed because of the massive amount of debt they have accumulated from their 5G buildout. Right now it is trading very close to its 300 MA, and from a technical standpoint near strong support (touching previous highs from 2013 and 2014). **For dividends you care about building out future cash flow which means you need more shares. If the dividend is safe and the company is performing, then you want the stock to go down since you can use this opportunity to accumulate more shares for cheaper.**"

I would advise he stays away from most \"gurus\". \n\nFinancial freedom or the ability to do what you want, which whomever you want, whenever you want is true freedom and is often constrained by poor finances, a job, or other limiting factors. Him recognizing this I amazing at a young age. One book I would advise you and him reading is rich dad poor dad.

    "question": "If US has the privilege of printing their own money to pay off previous debts and buy goods from around the world, why can't they just print it endlessly and pay it off altogether ( especially foreign debts ? ) Would that immediate flow of Dollars out to the world destroy the economic fabric of the world?",
    "answer": "The problem is that you can only do this once. Money supply is around [20T$](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/M1SL), and federal debt is around [29T$](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/GFDEBTN). As debt is issued in dollar, and not in, lets say, Euro, the US could indeed print 29T$ and pay all their debts. There are two problems with that. First, if you ever want to borrow money again afterwards, people are going to demand a very high interest rate and repayment in different currencies. So you can get out, but only once. Second, in the short term, it would still destroy the value of the dollar, meaning that the buying power of US citizens would drop. This would also make the US more competitive, boosting exports, but in the short-run it will mostly likely solely have negative consequences."

    "question": "Of course, no one person is a hero. And certainly NOT me. I’ve got a lot of studying to do to figure out if I can be helpful. But I think I can. Whether it’s now or a month or six months. But I like what you are doing. And I will try to help however I can. Let me know how you think I could help. Maybe it’s one day taking a position in GME or maybe it’s just exposing the greed and corrupt of some people (you know who!). I will also help however I can with the BCG stuff. I never thought my comment on BCG would lead to meeting this community. But I’m glad it did. Thanks again for having me 👊",
    "answer": "My $0.02: it is imperative that real retail investors know that they’re ‘buying’ and ‘selling’ shares that are not necessarily deposited into their accounts. Unscrupulous brokers can just take their money and add ‘1’ to their balance to convince them that they were just credited a share. If the user sells at a loss, the broker just hands the sale amount, debits the share from the user’s account and pockets the difference. If the sale is for a profit, the broker just shrugs and gives the money over. Plenty of other people will sell at a loss anyway. \n\nThis is why we suspect that brokers like RobinHood shut off the ‘Buy’ button in Jan 2021, when the price of GME started skyrocketing. They didn‘t hold the shares, and would have been on the hook for actually paying out of pocket. \n\nAnd the best way to counteract that is to Direct Register all GME shares, using GameStop’s Transfer Agent, ComputerShare. You might have seen all the purple circles on this subreddit. That is all retail investors buying shares via ComputerShare, or transferring shares from other brokers like Fidelity. We’re also tallying it all up using our DRSBot. \n\nEven GameStop has started announcing the DRS’ed shares during their quarterly filings. So far, we have locked up about 9 million shares, a significant portion of GameStop’s micro cap. \n\nThis results in real shares drying up in the market, and corrupt short hedge funds are resorting to more and more naked shorting to keep the price of GME suppressed. There are some times when the price starts to rush up, but it‘s always beaten down by the bad faith actors. And this corruption is entirely evident to anyone capable of a little technical analysis. As quite some folks on here are. \n\nThe SEC is either corrupt and useless, or incompetent and therefore useless. GameStop can‘t even ask us shareholders to DRS our shares because the SEC might declare that market manipulation. \n\nWhat we need to do is to keep DRS’ing, and spread the word out to as much people as possible so they can protect themselves. The bad actors have the full might of CNBC &amp; Jim Cramer and other bought &amp; paid for financial outlets. We have just our voices. \nAnd that is why I just gave this essay to someone who really doesn’t need to be taught what DRS is. \n\nWe would love it if you could use your reach and voice to try to educate folks NOT on Reddit to DRS their shares. And not just for GameStop. There are quite a lot of shorted companies out there. If those shares become unavailable too, the bad faith hedge funds and banks reducing America and the world to a slavish hell hole will run out of ammo and steam fast. \n\nAlso, I read somewhere that you’re friends with the YouTuber Mr. Beast. If you both were willing, introducing this subreddit to his channel might spread the word super fast. There are quite a lot of highly educated, intelligent and knowledgeable folks (Dave Lauer,  Dr. Susan Trimbath, Jon Stewart himself, to name just a few) who have educated us and been educated too. We are always willing to teach new users, although bad faith actors embedded within this sub sometimes try to make that difficult. \n\nYou entering our sub is a rare opportunity for exposure we have been struggling to get. Please, take all the time you need to ask questions, understand the depth to which the rot in the US markets goes, and always feel free to ask the community questions. But when you’re ready, if you’re ready, please help us spread the word in any way you or your friends can. \n\nMy flair says ‘Holding for History’. I truly believe this is a fight for not just history that will be studied, but for our very future. \n\nI truly hope you’d be able to fight with us."

I have been raised in an apartment complex, and my family is incredibly dysfunctional.\n\nI plan to start at community college in part bc it feels like the most financially “safe” decision, especially since both years of community in my city are free. I admittedly don’t have an idea of what I want to major in. \n\nHowever, what I do know is that in spite of my issues w depression and anxiety, I am really hoping to move out of my income bracket. I don’t know how to pay taxes. I know nothing about potentially buying a home and about how to save my money.

Buy a certified used car, never new. 4. Save an emergency fund 3-6 months of full expenses. 5. Don’t tell anyone you have money . NO ONE. 6. Never loan money to anyone. 7. After you have saved emergency fund, start a Roth and try to max it out. 8. After you max Roth, take as much as you can comfortable afford and invest in vanguard funds. You can sign up on vanguard or fidelity. In the meantime, try to eat well, sleep, gym, and continue trying to make more money and learn a trade or get a practical major.

    "question": "Volkswagen AG, the world's second-largest automaker, has joined Tesla's lobbying camp in calling on the Indian government to lower import duties on electric cars to spur demand for cleaner vehicles.\n\nGurpratap Boparai, managing director of Volkswagen's Skoda Auto India, said that even if import tariffs on electric cars were cut to 25 percent from the current level of up to 100 percent, it would not pose a \"huge threat\" to domestic companies in India, but would instead help drive investment.\n\n[Volkswagen Joins Tesla in Calling on India to Lower EV Import Duties](https:\/\/www.asiantechpress.com\/volkswagen-joins-tesla-in-calling-on-india-to-lower-ev-import-duties.html)",
    "answer": "Unpopular Opinion, but I think we should wait a bit in lowering import duties on EV. Not much, maybe 2yrs?\n\nHere is my argument(feel free to disagree and point out flaws, I welcome it)\n\n1. India is in a very nascent stage of EV adoption, we should first finalise on our EV standards. Testing Standards, Charging Standards, Power Delivery Standards. US is facing challenges due to different plugs by different manufacturers, whereas in the EU, they have a standard, and manufacturers have to comply or provide adapters.\n2. Wider accessibility of charging stations is a must, now with the right standards, we should have higher availability of these as well, across the country. If there aren't enough charging points, people will not buy EV, without mass adoption, International players may not see the sales they hope, and might just walk out of the country. It is an egg-chicken problem, but the Govt. should start putting a few charging points in cities at least (primary target for EV vehicles).\n3. Indian manufacturers like Tata, Mahindra, Hero, Ola are doing amazing work in the EV sector. Moreover, startups are working in this space to better battery tech, power delivery, availability and cost reduction. They should be given some time to flourish, make errors, learn and course correct. If Tesla, VW, and others enter the market, so will their money. It will kill all these startups and innovation Indian manufacturers are working on.\n\nIt would be amazing to have a flourishing EV ecosystem, but I would also like to see India take the lead in the same. In the next 2-3yrs, we will see EV options across segments (scooters, bikes, super bikes, cars), and with more competition, the cost will come down as well.\n\nIf we play our cards right, if we let our homegrown brands to get bigger, it could be a game changer for us. I am all for Tesla and VW and others to come to Indian markets with their EV offerings, but with tough competition from Indian manufacturers and a standardised efficient EV ecosystem, it will be a boon for Indian consumers."

    "question": "I have a lot of free time, basically i stay home almost all the time. My goal is to get rich, how would you recommend me to spend my free time? Read specific book? Look something on websites? Thank you",
    "answer": "Here are 4 things I think you should learn. \n\n1. There are two categories of people and only 2. There are those who create jobs (business owners) and then there are those who take jobs (employees)\n\n2. Scalability. Example: Plant 1 tomato seed. Now you have 1 tomato tree. Take all of the seeds from the tomatoes on that tomato tree and replant all of those new seeds. Now you have 10 tomato trees. Rinse and repeat Etc. (I know nothing about gardening so take this example lightly)\n\n3. Sacrifice. \n\n4. Perseverance \n\nI’ll go over those points a little more. \n\n1. You will never be truly wealthy if you’re an employee. You can be a high earning programmer, doctor, salesperson etc. But you’ll never truly be wealthy unless you’re the one who own who owns the company. For as long as you have a boss you won’t be rich. You can be well off with a high salary but never wealthy. \n\n2. Scalability: I’ll tell you a story about a friend of mine from high school. Once he got his diploma he immediately went into a trade school. His profession was plumbing. A lot of people mocked him because he chose a blue collar job while his friends went to pursue degrees at college. He started off by starting his own company. \n\nAt first he had 1 van and just himself. He would travel around the city doing random plumbing jobs. His salary wasn’t great but it wasn’t bad for his age. Once he saved enough money he bought a second van and hired a plumber\/employee to run that van. So now he has two vans , himself, and his 1 employee. He can now do twice as many plumbing jobs and his revenue has doubled. Then he bought a third van and hired a third employee to run that van. Now his revenue has tripled. Today he has over 20 vans and 20 full time employees each operating their own van. He has a receptionist who manages all of the jobs and he is partially retired and he is in his 30s. He doesn’t have to grind a 9-5 anymore. All he does it occasionally call to check in and get progress updates. He is still scaling up and growing. For each of his vans he profits almost $25k a year. 20 vans times $25k is $500k a year and he doesn’t have to work anymore. \n\n3. Sacrifice: this doesn’t always apply to everyone but during my entire 20s (I’m 30 now) I didn’t have much of a social life. I worked like a dog and focused only on my businesses. While my peers went out every weekend to party and had healthy life\/work balances I was living a life of obsession and the only thing on my mind was work. By the end of this year or the next year my goal is to be able to have enough staff to run my businesses without much oversight and my yearly income will be close to 7 figures a year while I do whatever I want. Side note: I do not recommend doing this. It was extremely stressful, tiring, frustrating, and almost all of my personal relationships had gone to trash. I have zero relationship with my family and have no friends outside of work. \n\n4. Perseverance: never give up. I had over 20 failed businesses during my 20s. There were several times where I bet everything I owned on the wrong business and several times I ended up in horrible spots and had to move back home. Take each failure as a lesson and use failure as a learning tool. You can only fail so many times before you hit success."

    "question": "I see this expression all the time, but I don’t really see how it plays out in reality.\n\nIsn’t almost all the money owned by the rich being continually invested?",
    "answer": "“Hoard” is a politically charged word. This is a difficult question to answer without coming down on one side of a very contentious divide. What people typically mean when they say “hoard” is that rich people are holding lots of their wealth in safe, static assets like cash or Treasury bonds. This money is static because it is subject to certain constraints that prevent it from being used for more productive, but risky endeavors.\n\n&gt;Isn’t almost all the money owned by the rich being continually invested?\n\nYes and no. Not all investments are created equal. When people invest, they usually want some mixture of both 1) safety, and 2) a high return. There is generally a trade off and people will have different preferences depending on their risk tolerance. When people hold cash in a checking account, they are letting the bank do the investing. Banks have lots of convoluted rules for how they can manage assets due to the inherent risk of bank runs like 2008. What’s happening now is that banks are also “investing” in cash and T-bonds to a large extent. Note that cash held by banks at the Fed (called Reserves) is ultimately not really invested in anything. It’s there in large part to back up everything else and provide a buffer in the case of a run. Before 2008, banks didn’t used to hold Reserves in excess of their legal requirements, but during the crisis a lot of things changed and suffice it to say that now they are holding (or from some people’s perspective “hoarding”) more than ever. And as for T-bonds, both private banks and the Fed are investing in the U.S. Federal government when they choose to hold Treasuries. But the government isn’t actually spending or investing in a lot relative to the global demand for its debt.\n\nOver the past few decades, and especially in the last 10 years, the amount of money being held in cash and T-bonds has increased substantially. One effect of this can be seen in M2 money velocity. Basically, M2 money is cash and money held in checking accounts, and the velocity of M2 money is a variable that loosely corresponds to how fast M2 money is moving around the economy. Since this value is decreasing, we can infer that more and more money is sitting around in cash, ultimately being backed up by Reserves at the Fed. Theoretically, the people\/institutions who own this money could invest it in something else that yields a better return. But they’re not doing that. As to why this is the case—that’s a hotly debated topic. One theory is that it’s the product of rising inequality. The richer you are, the lower your marginal propensity to spend. This is just a fancy way of saying that rich people tend to save money while poor people tend to spend it. There is a *huge* desire for saving in dollars right now that far exceeds the capacity of those dollars to be spent, because poor people don’t have any money (relatively speaking). Another theory is that investors are fighting a losing battle against deflation and demographics. The world population is getting older, and there are fewer and fewer young workers per old retiree with each passing year. This has theoretically decreased the opportunities for robust growth, i.e. there really is no good answer for how all that cash should be put to use. Moreover, old people tend to want safer assets, so they are less eager to put their money in relatively riskier investments.\n\nNote that this is just a one picture of what “hoarding” can mean. In practice it can refer to other ways that rich people make inefficient investments. Buying up lots of expensive art or super yachts might also be seen as ways in which rich people are using their wealth in ways that don’t necessarily lead to as much “trickle down” as supply siders like to claim—i.e. hoarding. Think of the dragon Smaug, who hoarded a mountain of gold on Erebor. Perhaps he was afraid the dwarves were going to use it poorly, such as by starting a war with the elves. He also probably didn’t think the dwarves would pay back any loans he made in the first place, and so he chose to sit on the gold instead—an inefficient but safe choice. In the end, he was killed by the dwarves (technically the kill shot was from a man named Bard, from Laketown) due to his greed and the mountain of gold that was spent by the dwarves who acquired it ushered in a literal Golden Age fueled by productive investments in new infrastructure and the like."

Family always told me the stock market was a scam and school didn't teach anything about it. I wish I would have figured this out when I was 18 or 19 instead of blowing all the thousands I'll never get back.",
    "answer": "If you want the stocks simply for income\/cash flow, you might want to look at some covered call etfs. Typically they return 8%+ dividend yield and often payout monthly. Basically, you’re $44k would get you approximately 4K per year, dripped back in you \nget the Buffet compounding effecting monthly. \n\nTypically, this strategy is used by retirees that need cash flow to live, very safe depending on which you buy.\n\nCons: less capital appreciation than potentially owning the stock itself, but if your goal is simply cash flow then it could work.\n\nThe theory is that stock capital appreciation is never your money until you sell, but if you are holding that stock for dividends... then the whole idea is never actually selling. Therefore, you really only get the much smaller dividend cash flow, but feel richer on paper.\n\nEx. Buy stock X at $100 with a 3% div, $100,000 = $3,000 per year. Now let’s say stock X goes up to $125 in 5 years, you’ve made $25,000 in capital gains, but you didn’t really because you haven’t sold the stock. Instead you’ve really only gained your $3k per year div (potentially compounded with a drip but let’s imagine it’s just $3k for simplicity). Therefore a total earning of $15k in div and $25k in capital appreciation = $40,000... but only $40k if you sell your shares... will you do that?\n\nPeople end up feeling richer than they are because the number gets so big, but you never actually get that money until you entirely sell out of the position. Most people actually never sell when their stocks are peaking because of human nature\/greed. Typically people end up selling when their capital appreciation goes down basically wasting all of that time holding for only a 3% return per year.\n\nCovered call etfs: basically buy the etf for the monthly dividend and annual div yield of 8%+. Take for instance ZWC (Canada) 8.19%. $100,000 = $8,190 per year. Over 5 years that’s $40,950. That beats the individual stock purchase without having to worry about if you bought a loser.\n\nPros: you get that money! That money is yours, paid out every month. You can do whatever you want with that, it’s yours irrespective of capital appreciation or depreciation. Obviously, reinvesting those divs monthly would compound quite quickly. Basically, your first year of drip would be over $700 more for next year, rinse repeat and the drip keeps increasing. In 10 years with a drip, you’ve almost doubled your returns, now you’d be bringing in almost $16,000 per year, $1,333 per month. Invested in a tax free account and all of that money is yours.\n\nMy perspective: not very much capital appreciation over the years. These etfs are meant for cash flow, not necessarily great capital appreciation returns. So essentially, if you want to beat these funds then you better have an average return of over 8.19%, in this instance, every year, across all of your stocks, for the rest of your life - professional hedge fund managers don’t even return that over 30+ years, we call it reverting to the mean. Most people are bad stock pickers, they get one winner and then have 3 losers. These etfs essentially eliminate that entire stress of picking good stocks or suffering paper hands over losses from picking bad stocks. 8.19% is also on par with s&amp;p500 returns over the past 30 years, in fact a little more... and without all the stress of depreciation.\n\nCash flow is king!\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor, these are my opinions solely. I am not currently employing this method yet but by March I have $300k going into this strategy. Atm, I have a $20,000+ annual div returns account from various stock picking. Like I said above, I’m winning in some and losing in others but an average 5.6% average annual yield on them."

    "question": "I keep hearing about this and wondering if its true or false. They claim that rich countries buy resources from developing countries and those rich countries manufacture. This manufactured goods are significantly more expensive than the resources they bought from thus they get more money than those poorer countries. While the rich countries wealth grows very fast the poor countries grow at a slow rate since they dont manufacture. Is this true? Another question I am gonna add. What can these poorer or developing countries do to get richer?",
    "answer": "Every reply you've gotten so far couldn't resist pigeonholing mercantilism, slavery, imperialism or colonialism into your question so I'll take a swing at this. While developmental economics aren't really part of my wheelhouse, a good kick-off point would be to refer to the [FAQ section on free trade, protectionism and development.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_protectionism_and_development), but I'll !ping DEV just in case.\n\n&gt; While the rich countries wealth grows very fast the poor countries grow at a slow rate since they dont manufacture.\n\nGenerally speaking this goes against the idea of convergence - the catch-up effect - based on the [law of diminishing marginal returns](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diminishing_returns) as we know it per the [Solow-Swan model](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solow%E2%80%93Swan_model#Conditional_convergence). Mind you, the proper institutions and policies need to be in place and there is a lot of literature on the subject of convergence\/divergence so there are some caveats to keep in mind, but a quick look at the [growth rate of real GDP per employed person](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/growth-rate-of-real-gdp-per-employed-person) or [GDP growth per capita](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/gdp-per-capita-growth?time=2012) over the years - as well as a general knowledge of history concerning rapid economical development of poorer countries like the \"Asian Tigers\" or the \"Celtic Tiger\" and various [other similar examples](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tiger_economy) - should be enough to dispell this idea fairly quickly. Notice in the graphs how growth in the West has remained relatively stable and marginal, while Southeast Asian economies have exploded.\n\nAdvanced economies tend to rely on intensive growth through productivity increases much more than developing countries which still have lots of \"easy\" room to grow through extensive growth (= maximizing ones economic inputs like resources and labour and thus aggregate output). One other thing to keep in mind however would be the [Lucas paradox](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lucas_paradox) which begs the question why we do not always see capital flow from rich to poor countries.\n\n&gt; What can these poorer or developing countries do to get richer?\n\nGuarantee stability - ranging from political to judicial etc - and trade."

    "question": "I'm having trouble understanding the argument from my friend.\nI know people need somewhere to live but I don't understand how being a landlord is contributing to the economy. To me they rent their place to people who cannot afford to buy a house.\nBut the rent can be higher than the loan installments. And in the end you own nothing. They don't create wealth. In fact, in my country they take advantage of people's desperation and increase prices when they can. They don't create invoices\/receipts, so the money I pay to rent is not declared to the fiscal authorities.\n\nWould you help me understand this?\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nThank you.",
    "answer": "Of course the service of renting out housing creates value.\n\nI mean, just imagine, you're young and moving away for college. You need a place to live. How are you supposed to accomplish that without landlords? Essentially the only options are, you rely on the kindness of strangers to allow you to live somewhere for free, that's not exactly sustainable. Or you buy a house or apartment. You have no real income or savings and you don't even know where you want to live after college. Burdening yourself with a loan is most likely a pretty damn terrible idea.\n\nObviously there's also the more likely third option y you're simply unable to move and severely limited in the places you can live at all. I mean, what would *you* do without a landlord? \n\nLandlords neatly solve the problem of providing housing for people who can't or don't want to purchase their own. Ultimately it's that simple.\n\n*How* exactly that happens is a different question. In my country we generally have a strong legal framework where tenants actually have a bit more power than landlords (usually). Any \"shady business\" is so rare that it's not really worth thinking about."

    "question": "Never thought of this. If you're married does your number needed to retire double or increase substantially?\n\nMaybe the same question but, what if you have dual incomes? Does the amount needed cut in half or decrease at all?\n\nI guess my lack of knowing what retirement funds exactly fund is my problem?",
    "answer": "It helps to stop thinking of a married couple as two distinct individuals and to start thinking of them as one entity: a household. Our household income is every dollar that comes in, regardless of who earned it. Our household expenses are every dollar that goes out, regardless of who spends it. There’s no “me” or “you” anymore, we became an “us” when we got married. \n\nThe household needs enough of a nest egg to generate enough income to cover the household’s expenses, regardless of whose name is on the accounts. The 4% rule is a common guideline for determining that, so take your annual expenses and multiply by 25 or your monthly expenses and multiply by 300. For example: if you need to spend $5k\/month that’s $60k\/yr which means you’ll need a $1,500,000 nest egg"

    "question": "I like Dr Wolff but feel he blames capitalism for that which it inherently can’t be responsible for. \n\nTake his example in this vid for instance \n\nPer his analogy, the employee (us), would have agreed to not partake in said ventures profitability, in exchange for the security of a stable income. The entrepreneur (Harold) doesn’t have that security, so if the business fails, he would sustain losses. We on the other hand could walk away scot free.\n\nCapitalism would also allow us to partake in profits if that’s what we want. We’d simply start a restaurant of our own or develop an equity agreement with Harold. \n\nWhy do all of capitalism’s critics accuse it for things it isn’t responsible for?\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/2mI_RMQEulw",
    "answer": "It's more about the framework in which Marxist economics operate in.\n\nUnder the labor theory of value, well, value comes from labor. And to make a long story short, surplus value is the difference between labor cost and the value created by that labor.\n\nSo, value comes from your labor. But *because* surplus value is by definition the difference between the value your labor creates and what you receive in return, extraction of surplus value is *by definition* exploitation.\n\nWhich is all fine and dandy in the sense that those are for the most part internally consistent definitions, and you can in principle define things however you want.\n\nThe problem is that the entire premise rests on the labor theory of value actually being a valid theory of value. Nowadays science agrees that it is not, so any conclusions that rest on the LTV fall apart with it.\n\nMainstream economics would tell you that the price of your labor is determined by supply and demand for your labor. That doesn't in of itself mean you are \"fairly\" compensated or that the price of your labor is automatically \"good\" or \"optimal\" in any economic sense, but it also doesn't mean that it's automatically exploitation, either.\n\nThat said, there certainly are plenty of scenarios where you can make arguments that wages are not close to what they would be under perfectly competitive markets, [monopsony power in labor markets is a big part of the literature around minimum wage for example.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_minwage\/)\n\n&gt;Why do all of capitalism’s critics accuse it for things it isn’t responsible for?\n\nWell, at least part of it, for Marxism, is that Marx' writings were always more of a critique of \"capitalism\" rather than offering alternatives. Not to mention that it's often in the political interest of such people. That said, I don't think there's a \"scientific\" answer to that."

    "answer": "As someone who got diagnosed with a life-altering cancer at a relatively young age (late 30s), the best advice I can give you is not to make any immediate huge life decisions in the first few months.  Those first few hours\/days\/weeks after diagnosis, you start questioning *everything*, your brain just goes into a kind of hyper-emotional survival mode, and if you're a planner like me, you start reassessing just about every aspect of your life plan\/situation, because it now looks like things are 180 degrees different from how they were just the day before.\n\nBest advice I wish someone had told me at the time... just breathe, let yourself go through the emotions, but hold off on any major life decisions for at least a few months.  Give your brain time to adjust to the new situation and develop a more solid understanding of what you're actually going to be facing.  Once you've processed everything and emotions aren't running the show quite so much, then you can start reassessing things and figuring out if changes need to be made.\n\nI'm now almost 6 years out from my diagnosis and while I'm not cured, the condition is responding really well to treatment, and my prognosis is for a mostly normal life.

    "question": "It's something we hear a lot but is there any truth to it?\n\nMost 'rich' people are business owners who are able to deduct expenses such as employee wages and by purchasing goods. But aren't these goods and wages also major tax sources for the government?\n\nWould there be a more effective way to tax the 'wealthy'?",
    "answer": "It's probably helpful to use an example. Say Company X spends one million on widget components and one million on wages for workers to put together the widgets, then sells the widgets for two million. The revenue was two million but the expenses were also two million, so Company's profit was $0. Because the company made no money, Company X\/ the owner wouldn't pay taxes. \n\n  \nThe workers pay taxes on their income because that's their income. And the goods themselves are taxed. But the owner wouldn't be paying any taxes because they got nothing. Generally speaking**\\*\\***, deducting expenses isn't a magic trick that lets you avoid taxes on income. Expenses are money going out, meaning the company is losing money unless the revenue coming in matches or exceeds it.  \n\n\nIf, instead, Company X made three million selling the widgets, now there's a million in profit.  How that money gets taxed depends on the type of company. Company X could be a simple pass-through entity (like a sole proprietorship or LLC) where the business owner's profits are taxed like ordinary income.  If Company X is a C-corporation, it gets more complicated.  Then, the company itself has to pay taxes  *and* the business owner has to pay taxes on money paid to them, but the rates the business owner pays vary depending on how the money is distributed (income, ordinary dividends, qualified dividends, etc.).\n\n  \n**\\*\\*** I say \"generally speaking\" because there are ways for businesses to use expenses to avoid taxes on profits, which is probably what you hear about. Say in the first year Company X spends a million on widget components, a million on wages, and a million on equipment to put together the widgets, but only makes two million, *i.e.* the company lost a million dollars.  The next year, Company X spends a million on components, a million on wages, and sells the widgets for three million.  There's a profit of one million in year two, but Company X can \"carry forward\" the loss from year one to avoid taxes on that profit.   \n\n\nThat may sound shady but, if you think about it, over the course of the two years the company's profit was $0, so it makes sense there wouldn't be any tax on that. The carry forward provision exists because companies often lose money in their first few years (because they need to buy equipment, market themselves to get a consumer base, *etc.*). So the \"profit\" they make in year two or year three or whenever is illusory because the company had been losing money previously. The carry forward provision allows the company to even out the fluctuation in profits and losses from year to year.  \n\n\nThere's a lot, lot more, and there are unsavory ways business owners avoid taxes, just like their are unsavory ways people earning ordinary income avoid taxes.  But this post is already long enough, and I'm just trying to explain why being \"able to deduct expenses\" isn't nearly as fun, exciting, or profitable as people seem to think."

I haven't read all of Why Nations Fail but am a historian of Latin America. I know that much of the scholarship examining Mexico's economic prospects look at the following: consistent war throughout the 19th century that expanded agriculture but didn't develop industrialization; the cost of developing railways through a mountainous nation when the most developed railway companies were foreign (USA); and industrialization coming into the country as a means of supplementing the North's consumer market. Much of Latin America hasn't been able to develop and industrialize in similar patterns to Europe and N. America \\*because\\* they continuously are supplementing those regions with primary resources, brain drain, and labor drain. Some economists agree with the thesis but it was first developed by sociologist and economic historian Immanuel Wallerstein in his books *The Modern World System* which is a 4 volume serios that traces mercantilism's rise to the rise of capitalism from the 16th to 19th centuries.   \n\n\nTL;DR most accounts contradict Diamond bc he is so deterministic about environment.

    "question": "Doing my research I can see that stock trading commissions on US brokerages - TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, Schwab are basically $0. There are no annual management fees as well.\n\nCompare that to the UK where some brokers such as Hargreaves charge you a whopping £12 per transaction AND a 0.5% management fee per year. How can this be? Why is the UK so expensive compared to the US. Oh, and we need to pay for foreign exchange to buy USD.....\n\nThen, since the UK government banned the sale of US ETFs, we need to buy expensive UCITS ETFs which have a comparably higher management fee.....",
    "answer": "US share dealing is predatory and shouldn't be used as a measuring stick.  At least not a positive one.  Payment For Order Flow is abundant and many brokerages are offsetting their costs by selling out their users data on mass.  You are not the platforms customer, you are the product they sell to clearing houses and investment institutes.\n\nUK is smaller and better regulated.

    "question": "I did a few economics units as an undergraduate in university and I remember being surprised that there is an economic argument for welfare as helping to mitigate the effects of the business cycle.\n\nI've also seen people argue that, due to the multiplier effect, welfare actually 'pays for itself' in that it generates more economic activity than it removes from the economy.\n\nIs this true?  Is there a strong economic case to be made for the welfare system, or is it something we implement mostly on humanitarian grounds?",
    "answer": "Maybe! It depends on when, and on what program as well.\n\nWe should separate two arguments. The first you mention is around business cycles; in these situations some welfare programs can stimulate the economy. Since low-income people tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume, they can grow GDP in the short run. [Auerbach &amp;  Gorodnichenko  (2011)](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w17447.pdf) shows that welfare spending is more beneficial to GDP during a recession, for example. While these arguments have merit, it's important to note that they don't always apply.\n\nIn the longer term, it really depends on what program. \/u\/DrunkenAsparagus linked to a [really good paper on this here](https:\/\/scholar.harvard.edu\/files\/hendren\/files\/welfare_vnber.pdf) (with [accompanying visualization here](https:\/\/www.policyinsights.org\/#)) in another thread. To sum up some of the results, programs vary widely both in their cost to the government and in their value to the recipients. In grouping policy types together, policies aimed at child education and health in particular have a negative cost to the government (meaning they pay back their cost to the government, and then some) and a very high value to the recipients. Some policies pay a portion of their cost back, but not all of it. Some policies can actually impose an additional cost--if they discourage people from working, for example.\n\nLastly, this recent paper from [Bastian &amp; Jones](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/conference\/2020\/preliminary\/paper\/zB4hn9nf) analyzed the Earned Income Tax Credit and found it likely repays about 83% of its budgetary cost to the government."

No.  \n\n\nSo these are all gifts that the children can do without, that they don't need, that they'll enjoy if they get them and do without otherwise.  \n\n\nI think it's plausible that they will have no first-order effects.  \n\n\nBut if the children spend time playing with their toys that they would otherwise use in other ways, there could be effects from that. Etc. Subtle effects.  \n\n\nWe could look at the differences between good kids who get presents and bad kids who don't and try to see what difference it makes. But there are all those confounding factors. Starting with the intrinsic differences between good kids and bad kids.   \n\n\nStill an experimental approach might be useful.

    "question": "Printing a bunch of new money the past couple of years is what caused this huge increase in inflation, right? How exactly does raising interest rates combat all this new printing of money?",
    "answer": "There are at least a couple of different ways to think about this. One way is to realize that raising the federal funds target is synonymous with taking money out of the economy. In order to push the rate up, the fed sells bonds and takes that money effectively out of circulation, lowering the money supply.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to realize that higher interest rates disincentivize economic activity. Saving becomes more attractive relative to consumption. Borrowing becomes more expensive, raising the cost of investment and consumption of durables. This lowers aggregate demand and puts downward pressure on inflation."

    "question": "I’m an entrepreneur with 100% ownership of my company, and I’m considering restructuring to employee-ownership to boost loyalty, performance, company growth, and ethics.[Employee ownership is linked to better company performance on average.](https:\/\/wol.iza.org\/articles\/does-employee-ownership-improve-performance\/long)\n\nThis got me thinking. How would things be different in a society where ALL companies were employee owned? Would the economy flourish better than ever, or would it just not work with certain types of companies? Are there hidden downfalls? Is there a name for this type of economy, and have any authors or researchers ever published anything good expanding on that idea?\n\n(Please don’t say socialism, I’m not talking about collective ownership, I’m talking about employee ownership only.)",
    "answer": "We get asked this every few months, I'm going to copy and paste from some replies I gave recently...\n\nYou mentioned making your own company mutual. Those who advocate co-operatives believe that it can be an emergent outcome of an economy.  So, no dictator is need to force equality.  That's usually the hope behind Mutualism, though your view may be different. There are reasons to be sceptical of this.\n\nLet's say that every business in the economy is a co-operative.  Often it's specified that each business must be a worker co-operative.  Straight away this causes a problem.  What about a co-operative of two people, for example?  Suppose that myself and my wife start a co-operative with £1M of capital.  Another couple have a co-operative with £1 of capital.  The return of these would clearly be very different!  In other words, what is the threshold?  What co-op has so few members that it's effectively private?\n\nAnother issue is different rates of profit.  This can happen for various reasons.  Let's say we have two worker co-operatives each with similar numbers of members\/workers.  These two also have similar amounts of capital.  The members of each vote for the committee managing the enterprise.  What if one co-op elects good management and the other bad management?  In that case the members of one co-op would become much poorer and the members of the other richer.\n\nNotice that I don't have to look at much that's specific about the co-operative form itself here.  What I'm talking about here is mostly just the way every business works applied to the case of a worker co-op.\n\nA related problem applies to capital.  In some industries lots of capital is used.  In others only a small amount of capital.  A window cleaner can use a few ladders, a few buckets, and maybe a van.  A silicon chip company needs more.  That's true per-worker as well.  More capital means higher returns.  So, why should a co-op with a lot of capital look for new members?  New members will only water down the capital share owned by each existing member.  As a result, the co-op will charge new member for joining.  These charges are not theoretical, worker co-ops that exist make them, they're called buy-ins.  (For this reason there's a theory of supply for co-ops that's slightly different to other businesses).  So, some people who are relatively wealthy will be able to buy-into co-ops that are relatively profitable.\n\nIn this Mutualist world capital and labour haven't disappeared. It's just that the roles are fulfilled by the same people. The workers of a worker co-op are both worker and capitalist, as such they receive both labour and capital income. They must fulfil the corresponding roles. They must show patience and not spend all their capital. They must fulfil the entrepreneurial decision making role.  Some people must still decide what products are to be made in what quantities, there must be direction of available resources within each co-op. If the workers do not do this collectively as part of their work then someone must be paid to do it. There must still be investment, so some people must wait before they can get a return. The workers in each co-op will have the right to all of the profit split into shares. But, they must invest in their business for the future, which will often mean retaining some of the profit. Of course, if borrowing is used for investment then someone else must lend. If every business is a co-op then that means another co-op must lend.\n\nHere are some older threads on this subject:\n[thread1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/f0vro3\/why_are_coops_so_rare\/), [thread2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/fqukk0\/what_would_happen_if_every_business_turned_into_a\/) and [thread3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskEconomics\/comments\/6qk6tn\/coop_profit_maximizing_labor_quantity_question\/)."

And why am I just now hearing about SCHD. I feel like it wasn’t really talked about back in 2017,2018, or 2019. Every time someone mentioned an etf to me back then it was always QQQ.",
    "answer": "I've tried to continue and find a group of stocks since I was 22 (now 28) that does the following:\n\n1. Provides defense during economic downturns\n2. Adequate stock price growth during bull markets.\n3. Provides a second means of metric\/income.\n\nSCHD Does all the above:\n\n1. Handpicks a select group of stocks that are more defined by marketcap minimum and dividend growth of atleast 10 years. These stocks are much more defensive, and thus do better than the S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ during downturns.\n2. It does a good job with other finances with these companies aside from point #1. As a result when a bull market does hit, you will see growth with SCHD.\n3. The 10 dividend growth requirement will always see it filtering in and out companies with a strong payout, thus giving it a very good constant growth.\n\nThe yield for SCHD fluctuates between 2.5% (all time highs) and 4% (market lows), the key \"safespace\" for a company dividend outside of a REIT. If the dividend goes higher than 4%, the stock usually isn't growing too much or is stagnant. If the dividend is lower than 2.5%, you're better off just investing in the S&amp;P500, which has a 1.5%-2% dividend yield on average.\n\nThis was my research and what I saw with previous dividend ratios in the past. If you try to replicate this in a portfolio as well with a group of stocks, the same thing happens. Higher then 4%? Lower growth of the stock price. Lower than 2.5%? More volatility in the markets compared to S&amp;P and NASDAQ100\n\nI keep SCHD in my brokerage account and Roth IRA."

I’m not trying to push any agenda, I’m genuinely just curious what economists think about these economic systems and whether they see one, the other or a mixture as ideal— seeing as economists are likely some of the most knowledgable people to ask.\n\nFor clarity: by ‘socialism’ I mean a system where everyone has pretty much the same wealth, this being regulated by government. I say socialism and not communism because I think communism as a term is generally associated with authoritarianism, which is another issue I’d rather leave out of an economic discussion.",
    "answer": "I suggest you read [State versus Private Ownership](https:\/\/pubs.aeaweb.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1257\/jep.12.4.133) paper by Andrei Shleifer who is currently the #1 ranked economist in RePEc, i think it answers your question as directly as possible although the author defines \"socialism\" as nationalization of industries. The paper is lit review of theoretical and political-economy work on privatization &amp; state ownernship.  \n\n&gt;Private ownership should generally be preferred to public ownership when the incentives to innovate and to contain costs must be strong. In essence, this is the case for capitalism over socialism, explaining the ‘‘dynamic vitality’’ of free enterprise[...]. Moreover, many of the concerns that private firms\nfail to address ‘‘social goals’’ can be addressed through government contracting and regulation, without resort to government ownership.\n\nOther highly ranked economists in RePEc like Acemoglu would also agree that private property rights is fundamental to long run prosperity."

    "question": "I would certainly imagine so. \n\nAs labour becomes more digital it would be very easy for a company to off-shore much of their work load to cheaper countries. \n\nI'd assume highly regulated fields will be unaffected but unregulated fields like IT, customer service, software etc could easily be undertaken remotely. \n\nAnecdotally I've already seen this happening in software engineering jobs due to severe corporate budget cuts.",
    "answer": "Firms will offshore when the marginal benefit of moving the job exceeds the marginal cost of moving the job. For exposition, imagine that a firm has employees who have a distribution of skill from low to high. You can imagine that the low skill workers might be call center employees while the high skill workers might be the people in the CTOs office making big decisions about strategy and toolset. \n\nThink about the firm iteratively considering whether to offshore the next job. Initially they're all located in the US. First the firm looks at the low-skill call center workers and considers the marginal benefit of offshoring them (lower labor costs) against the marginal costs (reduced sales due to weaker customer service, bureaucratic complexity, etc) and decide to move the call center to India. Next they look at the next highest skill workers, maybe the IT help desk. The marginal benefit is still the reduction in salaries but there is a different marginal cost as well. Not having your IT worker in the same time zone could mean that it takes longer for the finance folks to get their problems fixed. Maybe they still decide to offshore the IT help desk. In each case, the firm is considering whether the marginal costs exceed the marginal benefits and will only offshore workers for whom the marginal benefits are high relative to the marginal costs.\n\nAs other folks have pointed out, it's non-trivial to assume that people in other countries do the work as well. Time zone is a huge barrier and the talent pool is generally not as good as it is in developed countries.  The fact that Google is willing to pay people in the Bay Area $250k instead of hiring someone in Delhi suggests they see some benefit to onshoring.\n\n Has the rise of WFH fundamentally changed this equation? I don't think so. In my mind, what's more likely is that employers will offer employees bonuses to leave SF\/NYC\/LA for lower cost of living cities within the US and adjust their salaries (Facebook already did this)."

    "question": "I watched a debate between Milton Friedman and some random college student and he makes three claims about the welfare state:\n\n\n1. The welfare state produces poor people.\n2. The welfare state encourages family's to break up.\n3. The minimum wage increases black employment.\n\nHow true were those claims when he said that and how true are those claims today? He said this in the 1970s so I would expect them to be dated.",
    "answer": "&gt;\tThe welfare state encourages family's to break up. \n\nAt the time when Milton Friedman was active, I believe this was commonly thought to be so since there was a strong correlation between welfare generosity (to single mothers) and single motherhood. Then, as economists started becoming more serious about endogeneity, the consideration that 1. areas with more single mothers are likely to pass more generous single mother benefits and 2. areas more culturally ok with single motherhood are more likely to pass more generous benefits, which all would confound and cause a false positive correlation lead to [Moffit (1994)](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/146113), where after adjusting for fixed effects, this relationship disappeared for whites, but remained for blacks. And shortly after, [Hoynes (1997)](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w5149) went further in thinking about confounders, and finds that the relationship between welfare generosity and single motherhood in black families disappears when you account for migration- i.e. welfare generosity does not seem to *cause* families to break up, but people more likely to become single mothers selectively move to states that offer better benefits. I believe this result is generally accepted even today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\tThe welfare state produces poor people. \n\nI have made several posts about similar claims to this, and I think this partially talks to this claim. Using the 'official' poverty measures which are based on income, which people tend to misreport and literally do not reflect increases in welfare (i.e. if you get health insurance coverage from the state, this wont be seen in a measure of your income, but it will be seen in changes in your consumption. Consumption also what theoretically matters more so than income)  and does not properly adjust for inflation, and which also capture alot of young college educated people and others who are not really who we think of as 'poor', then it does not look like many great society and welfare schemes have done much for helping poor people. However when you switch to more accurate consumption based measures and adjust for inflation properly, poverty has actually decreased quite a bit due to anti poverty polices, over the past few decades- estimated up to [26.4 percentage point decline](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w18718). more on how to properly measure poverty and why the 'official' measure is not great can be found [here](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w14827). \n\nI am not to familiar with the min wage literature so I wont address that here"

That led to the second thing I did that was completely stupid.  \n\nSo I told the wife that just once in my life, I would like a 1000+ car.  I bought another Viper and had the tuner modify it, twin turbo, 1300+ HP, and it was used in and won a couple of magazine competitions against far more expensive cars, like Bugatti.  It made the covers of 4 car mags in the US and EU.  My car briefly held 2 speed records for street legal cars.\n\nI was fun to drive and I raced it at a local track vs Ferrari, Lambo, Mazzers, Astons, BMW Ms, MB AMGs, Porsches, Ford GT, and lots of other things.  I beat them all except for one Porsche that was a purpose built American Lemans Series race car running on racing slicks.  I could drive past him on the straights, but he beat me in the curves,  \n\nThe best day ever with that car, Walter Reed hospital brought a bus load of wounded vets and their nurses to the track.  The Ferrari club had set it up and asked me to participate.  Soldiers with missing limbs, horrible burns, and all sorts of other problems got a day as a passenger in cars that cost anywhere from $200K - $2M.  Many of the soldiers had to be lifted from wheel chairs and placed into our cars. We set it up in 20 min races with very defined passing rules to protect both passengers and cars.  Each race the soldier would swap out and go in a  different car.  \n\nIt was a wet day and at one point, a $1M collectible Ferrari two cars in front of me spun out, going off track and then back across, dragging mud with him.  The Lambo behind him over corrected and spun out in the mud.  I couldn't break because there was another Lambo only a few feet from my rear bumper so I eased up and drove as gently thru the mess as I could.  The Lambo and Ferrari behind me also spun out.  The soldier beside me, looking back at the cars spinning all over yelled, \"THAT WAS AMAZING!! LET'S DO IT AGAIN!!\"  When we got back to the pits, my soldier passenger was telling everyone what had happened and how I was the only driver to get thru that corner.  \n\nThey had to shut the track down for an hour to clean and dry it.  Most of the soldiers came over to me and my car in the pits to take pictures of themselves with the American car that beat everything Europe and Japan ever produced.

    "question": "I've searched here, \/r\/economics, and \/r\/badeconomics and I cannot find anyone specifically asking \"is this considered good, if pop, economics?\" About the closest I think I found was someone saying a part of the book was required for an undergrad class, which I know is not always an indication of quality.",
    "answer": "It's good with some caveats as best phrased by \/u\/integralds \nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/badeconomics\/comments\/7yc8v5\/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit\/dugzwu2\/\n\n&gt; #The trouble with writing a pop-econ book\n\n&gt; So you're a distinguished researcher in economics. You've made a career out of carefully measuring $input and painstakingly documenting the causal effect of $input on $outcome. Your work is celebrated in a dozen top-5 articles. So you decide that it's time to cash in and write a pop-econ book about how $input affects $outcome.\n\n&gt; You start with a [picture.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/huQ9GG3.png) This is the partial plot of your $input against $outcome. You've waved a magic wand that solves all identification issues, so this *is* the causal effect. Just to be clear, you can run a suitably high-powered [regression](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/480yncP.png) through this data and get an economically and statistically significant effect. Great! [fn1]\n\n&gt; Clearly there's variation you can't explain with $input, because other stuff is going on as well. The world isn't monocausal.\n\n&gt; Anyway.\n\n&gt; Your book has to sell with a popular audience, so you can't just print out regression tables. You have to tell a story. Well, the data in a regression encodes a story: behind the data points in a scatterplot is history of policy across observation units. So you pick out a few [case studies](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/clWeNQF.png) and center the book around an examination of those case studies.\n\n&gt; And you sell your book. And people review it. And everyone wants to take a piece out of you.\n\n&gt; Some commentators scoff at your $input. Look, they say, $input doesn't do anything to affect $output. Look at [these case studies.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5PDPetu.png) We vary $input by a factor of three, and *nothing changes* to $outcome. \n\n&gt; Other commentators point out that many observation units with roughly the same level of $input have massively different outcomes. Look at [these case studies.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/yR3Jgah.png) All of these observation units have similar levels of $input, but their outcomes differ dramatically. What gives?\n\n&gt; Some smartass commentators even turn the tables on you. Look at [these case studies.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/IYEm6Uh.png) Now it appears that $input has a *negative* effect on the outcome! How could anyone take your new book seriously?\n\n&gt; -----\n\n&gt; [fn1] By the way, that's what a *t-*statistic of 9 with an R^2 of 25% looks like in 250 data points."

    "question": "I read somewhere that the 40 hour work week was supposed to be for one person per household. \n\nI would assume that, at first, dual income households saw a big advantage over single income households (on average). But eventually dual incomes became the norm, prices rose, and then it was expected in many ways.\n\nIs that why Boomers are looked at as doing so well, because they hit the sweet spot where women were working and getting paid well but it wasn't yet quite so expected and necessary like today, because they hadn't been doing it for long?",
    "answer": "I'm not quite sure what you are referring to.\n\nReal (meaning adjusted for change in prices) disposable personal income per person is [higher than ever](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/A229RX0) and has steadily increased, as you can see.\n\nPeople are likewise able to buy more. People have similarly  [been consuming more goods and services per capita over time](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/A794RX0Q048SBEA)\n\nIf you look back 40-50 years, when boomers were in their prime, you can clearly see they were worse off. It's not even close, they made and were only able to consume about half as much as we can now.\n\nWomen aren't just laborers, their consumers too. They increase the supply of labor, but they likewise increase the demand for labor. In addition, many of women's work in the past was \"unpaid\" or \"off the books\", like simple household work which took far more time in the past to do than it does today with modern technology and appliances. It's not like women 50 years ago were sitting around and not doing anything."

    "question": "Hi, I'm a teenager looking to get into stocks to make some money and I'm unsure if I should invest in typical blue chips or go with penny stocks? I start with about $500 and trade with either ETrade or Scott trade. Any tips from anyone?",
    "answer": "I am talking about investing here, not trading.  They are very different.  Warren Buffet is an investor, Jordan Belfort was a trader. \n\nUsually people start investing with $10,000.  But you can do it in $500 blocks on sharebuilder.com.  Buy $500 worth of a single stock, then save up another $500 to invest in a different stock.  Avoid buying all your stocks in the same market sector to diversify a little.  Once you have a few, you can buy additional $500 blocks of stocks you already have.  Keep the equivalent of 10% (since you are young) of your stock investment in bonds for security.  As you get older, increase the % in bonds. \n\n0) Unfortunately stocks are the only investment that steadily out paces inflation and interest rates, so you want to buy and hold stocks or ETFs.  Not mutual funds.  When you read Lynch's book it will be clear why.\n\n1)  Start studying \"Dividend Aristocrats\" stocks.  These are stocks that have paid dividends for 25 consecutive years.  Also look at stocks that will soon be aristocrats, over 15 years consecutive dividends.  http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/S%26P_500_Dividend_Aristocrats\n\nWhat you want to note is the dividend yield, it is a percentage.  For example for Johnson &amp; Johnson, JNJ, it is 2.9% and for HCP it is 5.7%.  But you also want to look at the dividend ratio to make sure all the earnings are not going to dividends, 80 -110% is bad.  Also look at company debt to make sure they are not borrowing to pay dividends.  For two stocks that are very close to each other, compare Return on Assets and Return on Equity to find the one with better management and buy that one.\n\n2)  Plan to hold your investments for at least five years before you take your profits.  Unless a stock drops 40% (and the whole market isn't crashing the same %) do not sell.  Waiting a few months to a year will see the stock recover and start rising again.\n\n3)  Calculate your 'load' to purchase your stock:  add the fees to buy and the fees to sell, calculate this as a % of your purchase, and subtract it from the yield.  If this is a negative number then do not buy at that yield (price).\n\neg, if it costs you $6 to make a buy and $6 to sell, a purchase of $600 worth of stock has a 'load' of 2%,  so you would earn 0.9% on JNJ and 3.7% on HCP.  (This math is not perfect as it doesn't account for you holding the stock for multiple years but it still works!)\n\nOne more test: compare the adjusted yield to the return on the best bond you can afford.  For you this will be EE or I bonds purchased direct (yay no load!) from treasurydirect.gov.  EE bonds are at 0.1% and I bonds are at 1.38%.  So you would not buy JNJ since it is lower than the bond yield, but HCP is above it so it passes our test.  \n\n4)  Do not try to buy at the best possible price, just buy at a price low enough to get you the best yield.  Using sharebuilder you will not be able to control exactly when the buy will happen, unless you pay for a dealer assisted trade and this is too much for the small buys you will be making.  Since the goal is to buy and hold, small changes in price are not critical.  Timing the market is very difficult, don't try to do it.\n\n5)  The best part about buying dividend paying stocks on sharebuilder is you get free dividend re-investment.  This means you earn a small slice of stock that will then earn you more future dividends.  This creates a compounding effect!  Be sure to set this up in your account.\n\nBefore you start investing you should have an emergency fund and be liquid.  Being liquid means you earn enough money to cover all your expenses.  You must not get in a situation where you have to sell your investments at a loss because you need cash.  Having an emergency fund is to prevent this losing situation.\n\nYou should read, in this order:\n\n\"The Richest Man in Babylon\", \"The Warren Buffett Way\", \"How to Invest $50-$5,000\", \"The Little Book That Still Beats the Market\", and \"One Up On Wall Street\".  If you want an advanced topic look into \"Elliot Wave theory\".\n\nS&amp;P 500 dividend aristocrats list:  https:\/\/www.topyields.nl\/Top-dividend-yields-of-Dividend-Aristocrats.php\n\nI used this method, plus a tech stock I knew well (IBM) to earn over 10% on my portfolio."

At some point, it amounts to mental masturbation. But I'll also add that most published research is probably just as useless and it's more a feature of our tenure system than someone getting too much joy out of their niche stats.\n\nA third one- economists that are dismissive of other sub-fields, or even other fields\/departments.

    "question": "I sent in my resignation letter just then and my boss called me with a furious tone saying he wanted to have a chat to me tomorrow 'before work'.\n\nI just want to know what my rights are before I go talk to him tomorrow. Am I obliged to tell him why I'm resigning? Yes, I have a new job and everything, but I know legally I don't have to mention it. \n\nI'm also the lowest level staff in the 'company hierarchy' so there's literally nothing for me to 'hand over' to colleagues. He's denied me every training opportunity these past 2 years, so there's no hope of learning or promotion.",
    "answer": "You dont have to tell him anything, other than that you are resigning.\n\nIf you are working your notice period, he has nothing to complain about, staff move jobs all the time. If he takes it personally, that's his problem."

    "question": "I'm up more than 110x so I just sold a chunk and used it to pay off my mortgage. I now own 100% of my own apartment and am completely debt free, thanks to a rather small bitcoin investment 7 years ago. Even if Bitcoin were to crash down to zero, my life is going to be so much easier now that I essentially have more money every month. This is a life changing event for me.",
    "answer": "These mortgage and debt pay off posts provided by bitcoin are far greater achievements in my opinion than someone buying up into a wealthy lifestyle.  You have secured your future rather than chasing more expenses and possibly debt. \n\nI personally hope to be able to just make a 20% down payment on an apartment in NYC where I live. It’s no small feat at around 100k minimum. So hopefully bitcoin will help me get there sooner than later."

    "question": "If so, what was the portfolio size that made that OK for you?\n\nI am thinking about doing it with a portfolio of about a quarter mil and average net premiums of about 3500\/m from CCs on top of market gains of about 6500\/m.\n\nPotential to add maybe another 100k if the market tanked to buy the mega dip between a HELOC and my spouse's portfolio which I don't currently manage and which is currently S&amp;P and forget.\n\nI would probably volunteer at a charity just to keep getting out of the house, as long as they were fine with the idea that I get to set that charity stuff aside and trade as needed to pay myself so they don't have to pay me.\n\nDual income household, so a bad month wouldn't be a disaster.\n\nUpside, I get to feel like I am giving back to society rather than trading time for dollars.\n\n\\- Edit - Thanks for the silver.  Thanks for the multiple instances of Hugz also.",
    "answer": "I think you should consider that your current availability to trade seems to be producing positive results, and if you spend more time following the market you might overtrade or stray from what works for you, leading to decreased returns."

    "question": "Shouldn't the taxes scare off businessmen and prevent them from succeeding too much? I don't think there are any structures to help them out either. \n\nIt's the opposite as Singapore, but it works just as well plus adds social benefits, while the Singapore\/Japanese model just seems to have drained their people dry. What's made it so?",
    "answer": "It’s because public spending doesn’t necessarily mean it’s regulatorily difficult to start or maintain a business charter. Nordic Countries make starting a business fairly simple, and a lot of the public spending those countries do benefits businesses as well."

    "question": "Private health care and insurance is a huge market in the US. How many jobs would be lost there if universal healthcare became the norm? Would it be enough for a noticable recession? Is there a way to do this without any ill effects on tbe economy?",
    "answer": "Universal healthcare implies nothing of the sort.\n\nUniversal healthcare in of itself means exactly one thing, that everybody has *access to healthcare*. It tells us absolutely nothing about the actual design of the healthcare system.\n\nFor the US, that could very well mean a vast overhaul and complete shift to a publicly owned healthcare system, or just an expansion of the existing one with relatively minor changes.\n\nDoes universal healthcare imply the loss of jobs? No. Is it possible to have a system of universal healthcare that would cause substantial job losses? Sure. But that could be the case for a non-universal system as well. The actual implementation matters."

    "question": "I know you need to be consistent and all and not giving up. But i dont understand How some make SO MUCH like billions from it. Because alot of people i have seen on the internet have become rich but not crazy rich like 100 million+ or billionaires level. And thats why im curious How some do it? Inheritence?",
    "answer": "The way I see it, there are three big factors: value add opportunities, leverage, and tax code advantages.\n\n**Value Add**\n\nThink about a house flip: you put in $10k, increase value by $20k or $30k. Now think about applying the same principle to an entire apartment building: 12 units, 20 units, 50 units, 100 units. Whatever you can do in the apartments to increase the rents will increase the value of the building by a multiple of the increase in annual cash flow. You can buy something for $2M and with the right tweaks, turn it into something that is worth $3M.\n\nThe \"ultimate\" value add opportunity is ground up development. It is also the most risky. If you can double your money every 2-3 years, then you will get to big numbers very quickly.\n\nPeople who rely on appreciation to get rich are taking advantage of a similar phenomenon, but they are ceding control of that phenomenon to the economy. You can hope that inflation goes up and interest rates keep going down to push values higher and higher. Or you can take action yourself to push values higher and higher.\n\nControl over the property is one of the best advantages of real estate compared.\n\n**Leverage**\n\nIf the bank will loan you 70% of the cost of the project, then your margins are even better. 20% unlevered becomes 40% levered. You have less money in the deal, which means you can do a bigger deal or you can put the same amount of money to work in more deals.\n\nThe more money you have, the more money the banks want to lend you. You will get lower interest rates and better terms on your loans as well.\n\nIf you want to keep a property after finishing your value add work, then you can refinance it and pull cash out for your next deal that way.\n\n**Tax Code**\n\nThe obvious provision of the tax code for folks at scale is the 1031 exchange. Rather than sell the property, pay taxes on the gains, and use the remaining proceeds for the next deal, the tax code allows for you to sell at the same time as you buy. You don't see any of the cash: an intermediary holds it for you between the two closings. This let's you take advantage of compounding returns on money that would have otherwise gone to taxes.\n\nIf you refinance and take out money that way, then that isn't taxable either because it is debt.\n\nThe another tax advantage in real estate is depreciation. The building does depreciate in the sense that it is used up over time, but it generally does not actually go down in value which makes this more of a phantom expense. Cost segregation allows more of that depreciation expense to be taken earlier on new deals. Then you can write off those losses against taxable rental income from the other properties."

    "question": "I'm extremely annoyed. I feel that I've been subjected to a bait-and-switch. When she called to set up an appointment, I said \"Before we do that, are you a fiduciary?\" She said yes. I said \"Great, I'd love to set up an appointment!\" When I got there I saw a plaque on her desk saying she was a broker. I read online that a broker is NOT the same as a fiduciary. I asked her about it and she said, \"Let me explain to you what a fiduciary is... blah blah blah... so I consider myself a fiduciary.\" \n\nShe thinks that I, 30, should invest my inheritance in a deferred annuity for retirement. I have ~60k earmarked for retirement and the rest of the inheritance earmarked for current emergency fund and paying off current bills. \n\n",
    "answer": "I'd also call the credit union and try to file a complaint. They're suppose to act in YOUR interest as opposed to satisfying some external equity holders.\n\nLet them know this person is dishonest and you're going to file a complaint with the state's insurance board."

    "question": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm just getting into algorithmic trading after having studied value investing on and off for a few years. However, there seems to be a barrier to entry for those that wish to get into this in terms of technical know how.\n\nAs I'm just getting started, would anyone appreciate a series of posts on how I go through problems and how I solve them and in so doing perhaps answer a lot of beginner type questions or even spark discussion amongst the sub on better methods? It won't be focused on the algorithm but more of here's this technical issue and this is how I solved or accounted for it. All the way from nothing to having a working algorithm that executes orders autonomously.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWell the response is unanimous. I'll get started on this and post as time allows.",
    "answer": "I'd love this. Thank you! \n\nOne thing I'm finding trouble with is going from thesis to code\/execution. I'm a total newb coder, but have solid investing experience from work and personally. \n\nAn example for me: can we use weighting changes in major indices as a predictor of long vs. short prospects? For example, if NASDAQ or DJIA is seeing returns from 5-10 top players and the rest are flat\/decreasing, what does this tell us about price direction? Could go the other way: what does overperformance of smaller caps in the indices tell us? \n\nThinking it's more than just small vs. large caps. It's a matter of the small % driving returns vs. what is happening to the rest of the index."

Worst is that he had laid out a plastic tarp and blanket so he wouldn't make a 'mess'. Terrible and tragic. I felt so bad for him and his family 👪"

    "question": "I currently make $52K, and got a job offer for $65K for a \"senior\" role in my field. The benefits are all better too, with a much better 401K match. I've only worked at my current position for 10 months though, so I'm not sure leaving so soon would be a good thing. Is it bad to jump jobs so frequently? Would it look bad on my resume?\n\nEDIT: to add more specifics of the situation, my manager just went on maternity leave until November, and I assumed many of her responsibilities. If I were to accept this offer, I'd royally be screwing over the people i currently work with, and would no doubt burn the bridge behind me.",
    "answer": "\"I know the timing isn't ideal, but it's an offer I can't refuse.\" \n\nYou'd be surprised how understanding people are in business--they get it, sometimes the timing just sucks but you have to do what you have to do. Just be sure this new company is somewhere you'd be comfortable working for at least 2 years. One anomaly doesn't make you a job hopper."

BUT, what if, you did the exact opposite of what you think you should do?\n\nSay you think a company will do well, so you think you should buy shares thinking you'll make money. However, instead of buying shares, with the knowledge that most first-time traders will end up losing money, what if you shorted the stock instead? Then, theoretically, the odds flip, and you have a 99% chance of making money.\n\nWhat am I missing, because obviously I am missing something, otherwise more people would have tried this already.\n\nPlease explain to me how dumb I am and follow it up with why this would never work (I'm a new trader trying to learn).",

Now, a clever man would sell, because he would know that only a great fool would buy right away. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose to buy. But short sellers must have known I was not a great fool, they would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose to sell.\n\nMan in Black : You've made your decision then?\n\nVizzini : Not remotely! Because the stock I’m considering comes from Australia, as everyone knows, and Australia is entirely peopled with criminals, so I can clearly not choose to buy.\n\nMan in black: Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.\n\nVizzini: Wait till I get going!"
