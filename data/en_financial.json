{"question":"Honest question.\n\nWhere is all the money?  I hear nothing but bad news about financial crisis all over the world, and it seems that there is a shortage of cash - like it is some sort of natural resource.\n\nPeople haven't stopped buying stuff.  They still need food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Taxes are still collected. Fines are still levied. \n\nSo where is all the money?  I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \n\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?","answer":"(relix already hit on some of this)\n\nIt's hard to explain this to a five-year-old, because there are some fairly abstract concepts involved, but here goes... \n\nAll actual \"money\" is debt. All of it, including monetary gold, etc. (Don't argue with me yet, I'll get to that.)\n\nImagine a pretend world with no money, some kind of primitive villiage or something. Now let's invent paper money. You can't just print a bunch of paper that says people have to give you stuff, because nobody would honor it. But you *could* print IOUs. Let's walk through this...\n\n- Let's say you're an apple-farmer and I'm a hunter. You want some meat but haven't harvested your crops yet. You say to me, \"hey, go hunt me some meat and I'll give you 1\/10th of my apple harvest in the fall\". Fair enough, I give you meat, you owe me apples. There's probably a lot of this kind of stuff going on, in addition to normal barter. In time, standard \"prices\" start to emerge: a deer haunch is worth a bushel of apples, or whatever. \n\n- Now, let's say a week later, I realize that my kid needs a new pair of shoes more than I need a bushel of apples. I come back to you and say,  \"Hey remember that bushel of apples you owe me? Could you write a marker, redeemable for one bushel of apples, that I can give to the shoemaker in trade for a pair of shoes?\" You say okay, and we have invented a *transferable note*, something a lot like money. \n\n- In time, our little villiage starts to figure out that a note redeemable for a bushel of apples can be swapped for all kinds of things. The fisherman who doesn't even like apples will accept apple-certificates in trade for fish, because he knows he can trade them to boat-builder who loves apples. In time, you can even start to hire farm-workers without giving them anything except a note promising a cut of the future harvest. \n\nNow, you are issuing *debt*: a promise to provide apples. The \"money\" is a transferable IOU-- your workers get a promise to provide value equal to a day of farm-work, or whatever, and it's transferrable, so they can use it to buy whatever they want. The worker gets fish from the fisherman, not in exchange for doing any work or giving him anything he can use, but in exchange for an IOU that the fisherman can redeem anywhere. \n\nSo far so good. But there are a couple of forks in the road here, on the way to a realistic monetary system, that we'll address separately:\n\n- What happens if your apple orchard is destroyed in a wildfire? Suddenly all the notes that everyone has been trading are basically wiped out. It didn't \"go\" anywhere, it's just gone, it doesn't exist. Real value was genuinely destroyed. There is no thermodynamic law of the conservation of monetary value-- just as you and I created it by creating transferable debt, it can also be genuinely destroyed. (We'll get back to this in a minute, it gets interesting). \n\n- The second issue is that, in all probability, the whole town is not *just* trading apple-certificates. I could also issue promises to catch deer, the fisherman could issue promises of fish, and so on. This could get pretty messy, especially if you got the notion to issue more apple-certificates than you can grow: you could buy all kinds of stuff with self-issued debt that you could never repay, and the town wouldn't find out until harvest-time comes. Once again, value has been \"destroyed\" people worked and made stuff and gave you stuff in exchange for something that doesn't exist, and will never exist. All that stuff they made is gone, you consumed it, and there is nothing to show for it.\n\nThe above two concerns are likely to become manifest in our village sooner or later, and probably sooner.  This leads to the question of *credit*, which is, at its most basic, a measure of *credibility*. Every time you issue an apple-certificate, you are *borrowing*, with a promise to repay from future apple-harvests. \n\nAfter the first couple of town scandals, people will start taking a closer look at the credibility of the issuer. Let's say the town potato-farmer comes up with a scheme where his potato-certificates are actually issued by some credible third-party, say the town priest or whatever, who starts every growing season with a book of numbered certificates equal to the typical crop-yield and no more, and keeps half of the certificate on file, issuing the other half. Now there is an audit trail and a very credible system that is likely to earn the potato-grower a lot of credit, compared to other farmers in town. That means that the potato-grower can probably issue more notes at a better exchange rate than some murkier system. Similarly, the town drunk probably won't get much value for his certificates promising a ship of gold. \n\nNow we have something like a credit market emerging, and the potato-farmer is issuing something closer to what we might call a modern \"bond\"...\n\n(continued in a reply to this post...)\n\n"}

{"question":"If my underlying assumption is incorrect, please elucidate me. \n\nThat said, I know of several family members who worked as grocers and retail workers and they were able to buy their homes in the 70s and eventually paid them off. \n\nI, on the other hand, have a well-paying job, a graduate degree, and I‚Äôm also married to a partner with a great job. \n\nYet, had it not been for inheriting the equity from my grocer and retail worker relatives, I would never have been able to affordably buy my townhouse. \n\nIn contrast, similarly sized 2 or 3 bedroom apartments for rent in my area are now priced at about $3,500 a month.

People talk about San Francisco, not Casper, Wyoming.\n\nAnother thing to note is that people became wealthier and in turn bought bigger houses. Houses cost more, houses *per square foot* have fluctuated, but not gone up so drastically.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.aei.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/houses2.jpg?x91208\n\nTwo trends are worth noting however.\n\nPeople on average go to college more often, spend more time on their education, and start working later. They also get married later. This means that even if they ultimately earn the same or more, this happens later in life.\n\nAlso, inequality pushes ownership rates down for the lower half and up for the upper half.\n\nFor more details, see:\n\nhttps:\/\/equitablegrowth.org\/a-generational-perspective-on-recent-u-s-homeownership-divergence-by-income-and-race\/\n\nSo, from a broad perspective, ownership hasn't changed, but who can afford what and where has changed."}

Losing a 50bn chunk of the economy by allowing the companies to collapse would possibly 500bn or more in damage to the public. \n\nWe'd have to pay unemployment to their employees, we'd have to wash all debt for them, meaning lenders have less money and wont invest as confidently elsewhere, we'd have to store or destroy their fleets (who's gonna buy all the planes?), regional government will lose income from property tax on office buildings, etc. The list goes on. \n\nSo its not as simple as \"well they're gonna go out of business, sucks for them\".

First, Model T's are not nearly as long-lasting as modern cars (given the needs of modern drivers). Model T's were engineered well for their time, had top speeds around 40 MPH, and could last as many as 20,000 miles before the engine needed a rebuild (not to mention its wooden wheels!). That said, a Model T does not have a fuel pump, water pump, oil pump, fuel filter, oil filter, distributor or single ignition coil among other parts that commonly fail in modern cars. \n\nSecond, modern motorized vehicles with similar capabilities to the Model T can be purchased for less than $4,000.

You're still waiting for your flight to arrive. \n\nJeff Bezos invests in rocketships. At 2-3 million I'm not sure what you're investing in? Index funds? Not to poo poo index funds I recommend them to everyone who wants to build wealth but c'mon you dont' need an index fund with billions in the bank. You can create a future you want to see. \n\nLastly, this is written so poorly I cannot take you seriously."}

At least 6 months of savings covering all expenses.\n\n2. A failure plan. It may sound like a bad mentality but it's better to be prepared. I recommend a max loss. If you hit it, walk away before you lose all your money. My plan is simple - if I have one negative month, I hit the job market. If I miss my goal 3 months in a row, I hit the job market.\n\n3. Make a goal. That can be either daily, weekly or monthly. People that trade on the side have flexibility with their goals but you're going to be trying to replace your income. It's important to know how much you need to make.\n\n4. A real desire to trade for a living. There's no boss and there's no salary. Staying motivated can be difficult if your biggest motivation is not having a real job. \n\n5. A strategy that has worked consistently in live trading. Not paper trading and not back testing. Both of those are important but it's even more important that your strategy holds up when there's real money and real emotions on the line. \n\n6. Profits. Your strategy should already be making you the money you want to make before you go full time. I recommend 2 years of consistent profits to see if your strategy holds up with changing market environments but it should be at least 6 months."}

{"question":"I‚Äôd like to invest in something that would generate $30000 a year. Would like to entertain as many options as possible. How about some ideas. Thank you","answer":"$30K from $700K is a 4.2% SWR (safe withdrawal rate). This is well within the 4% threshold describe by the [Trinity Study](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trinity_study). I.e. you can start by taking out $30K the first year. The next year, you adjust the $30K for inflation and take that out. There is a 95% chance your money will last and a very good chance it will actually grow.\n\nThe Trinity Study used a time horizon of 30 years. Your life expectancy at 68 is 16m\/18f but you have to allow that you could live longer. \n\nA key decision though is how to allocate your money between stocks and bonds. Typical advice might be 60\/40 or 50\/50. The problem is that bonds are now at a historically low rate.\n\nA second issue is that the equity market [CAPE Shiller Ratio](https:\/\/www.multpl.com\/shiller-pe) is currently very high. This indicates that equities may be over valued and that the market is due for a correction. The further implication is that you face a larger chance for a [sequence of returns risk](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/sequence-risk.asp).\n\nThe other realistic option you have is to purchase an annuity. Just off the top of my head, I believe you could get an annuity which would return even more than the amount you want to spend each year. The problem is that the annuity probably would not be inflation adjusted.\n\nSchwab offers a fixed immediate income calculator here: https:\/\/www.schwab.com\/annuities\/fixed-income-annuity-calculator\n\nI get a rough estimate of 42K \/ year for a the situation you describe assuming you are a male.

{"question":"So I just recently sold my first property and turned a good profit after almost 6 years of owning it. This was my first time selling a property so I relied on the realtor for a lot of advice. When he first saw the property ahead of listing, he recommended a price of $210k and I agreed since it was in the range of comps that had sold around that time, a month ago. I ultimately ended up accepting a full cash offer for $203k with a waived inspection, at his recommendation before it even hit the open market. This was still above the price of most of the condos that had sold during that time. Well, we just closed last week and 3 days later it shows up on all the platforms listed for sale at $240k. He‚Äôs listed as the realtor representing the property. For background this is a 1\/1 condo on the water in south Florida.\n\nAm I an idiot for not listing it for more or is this just the result of a crazy and fast moving market? Did my realtor just pull a shady move? \n\nEdit: I appreciate all the responses. Spoke to a trusted realtor\/broker I know in another part of the state and they agreed this was extremely unethical. Also did some digging into the documents and saw that that The name was changed a couple of weeks before closing to a corporation who‚Äôs address is in the same building as the realtor, so the case for shadiness is mounting.\n\nTLDR: Sold my condo for $203k at the recommendation of my realtor. 3 days after closing it‚Äôs listed again for $240k.

If your real estate agent is a Realtor (almost every one of them is), you should contact your state board of Realtors and let them know you believe your real estate agent has behaved unethically. \n\nA real estate agent encouraging you to take an offer before a property hits the open market and then turning around and helping the new owner list it on the open market - that sounds like they weren‚Äôt looking out for your best interests. \n\nYou should also call your state bar association and ask for a consultation. It‚Äôs usually free, and a lawyer may take your case without up front pay if they believe there‚Äôs a good chance for damages. \n\nPursue this. Do not ignore or cut your losses. You may be owed the additional value of the property plus four times that amount. This is also why real estate agents have to carry insurance.\n\nEdit: Want to explicitly say that this may be a misunderstanding or a unique circumstance.

{"question":"Guys, first off i‚Äôve been part of this community for only a short time, a little bit before this whole short interest craze but I seriously love the amazing things we‚Äôve done for peoples lives. I‚Äôve read about college kids paying off their student loans, people being able to afford to pay for family members cancer treatment, pet owners being able to afford their pups surgery. It‚Äôs incredible and I couldn‚Äôt be more proud to know I have a stake in this historical moment in time with all of you. \n\n\nYou see those headlines? That pushback from the big suits of wall street? WE did that. Together. If today was any indication at all, they are shitting their pants right now. I urge all of you to hold AMC and take advantage of dips if you‚Äôre inclined to do so. Please do not fall for hedge funds manipulating the market to send you into a panic sell frenzy. \n\n\nThe squeeze may not be tomorrow, and maybe not Monday, but it‚Äôs coming.

Isn't the drop in house prices cancelled out by the interest rates rising?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone. I really appreciate the replies and knowledge share. I have to be thankful for what I have though never feels good to pay more for the same.

{"question":"More or less all stock prices have been continously falling for the last week, if not longer. The housing market sees skyrocketing prices, the price on food, gas and electricity is increasing, and subsequently the consumer spending index drops. All of this leads to an increase in inflation.\n\nAre we going to see a stock market crash and financial crisis, like the ones in 1929 and 2008? Or are things different this time?\n\nAlso, should I personally be worried that I'm not going to be able to get a job, and afford stuff like a house and a normal standard of living, once I've finished my education in 5-6 years?","answer":"On this subreddit we mods don't like predictions about stock-market crashes. They are notoriously tricky, for the reason already given by another commenter.\n\nIt is fairly easy though, to explain why the current situation is so troubling. I'm going to concentrate on that.\n\nDuring the pandemic the Federal Reserve performed very expansionary monetary policy. Other Central Banks across the world did something similar. As it turned out that policy was too expansionary. Inflation was caused by various factors including pandemic-induced supply chain problems and the expansionary monetary policy.\n\nAs a result, inflation has been high for quite a while now. Over on \/r\/badeconomics Integralds gives [the path of the CPI price-level compared to the Fed's aim](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Pfn9szI.png). The price level is now far higher than the Fed's intended path. Since 2020 inflation has averaged 5.25% rather than the 2% aim. If inflation went to 0% next month and stayed there it would take *several years* for the Fed to get back to it's intended price-level path.\n\nThis leads us to the current problems. The Fed must raise interest rates to counter inflation. It must contract the money supply or at least stop it from expanding further. Raising interest rates is contractionary. It will raise interest costs and deter investment spending.\n\nThis affects the stock market in three inter-related ways. Firstly, companies can borrow less to expand, which affects their growth prospects. Secondly, stock speculators can borrow less to buy shares (margin loan interest rises). Thirdly, bonds become a relatively more attractive investment compared to stocks. (Notice, that only the first effect -probably the weakest one- applies to the wider economy.)\n\nWhen thinking about the US stock market you must remember that it has already declined a great deal. The S&amp;P500 peaked at 4818.62 on Jan 4th this year. Looking just now it is at 3742.23, that's a fall of 22.3%. Has the stock-market fallen far enough, or has it fallen too far? I have my own opinions about that, but conventional economics does not give an answer."}

{"question":"Hello, \nAmerican here. Astounded at how much the pound dropped vs USD after Liz Truss‚Äô and Kwasi Kwarteng‚Äôs speeches on tax cuts and breaks. \nImo multinationals listed in London should perform better on paper because of the decreased tax burden and oversees sales (in USD) should bolster balance sheets, however I‚Äôm curious what others thing!","answer":"Economist here. The main problem is that the budget was basically a gamble. The tax cuts weren‚Äôt funded and rely on economic growth to make up the reduced tax revenue. Economic growth isn‚Äôt forecast to be very good in the short term and the UK has a low medium to long term growth forecast when compared to other developed economies. This means that there is a strong chance that the UK government will need to borrow money to pay for it. High borrowing isn‚Äôt always negative but if this happens there isn‚Äôt anything to show for it. If borrowing was high to, say, invest in renewable energy infrastructure, then the lower energy costs in the future offset the borrowing. The markets can‚Äôt see what the benefit is here. It may work and it may stimulate the economy but it is strange timing with interest rates working against it at the same time.  \n  \nTaking my economist‚Äôs hat off for a second, my colleagues are all of the opinion that the new government is displaying economic illiteracy and that in itself is fuelling the negative sentiment. I can‚Äôt comment on this though."}

WSB honorary mod and legend status if he gets the SEC to commit to a date of enforcement. \n\nWhat would he do about the FTD and short interest? No company should be shorted over 100%.

It‚Äôs curious this can‚Äôt be resolved. \n\nMy suspicion is these hedgies are committing securities fraud or something else nefarious that they are attempting to cover.

There are some excellent threads outlining a strong case for share counterfeiting. \n\nWhat does he think GME‚Äôs share price is going to?

The only thing that truly changed was the ability to buy which remains THE problem now.\n\nWhat does he think about if there is a conflict of interest of Citadel bailing out Melvin who has a massive short on GME?

That bartender buys a $1 drink from the deli. That deli owner uses that $1 dollar to buy something, and so on and so forth.\n\nA while lot of people are going to say they made $1. Total income from that $1 will exceed one dollar since that same dollar was used over and over again.  \n\nBut if I think, ‚Äúoh, I might need this dollar later‚Äù and stick it in my sock drawer, all those transactions won‚Äôt happen. Economic activity falls. Incomes fall. Prices may even decrease as everyone on that chain of economic activity saw their income fall when I broke the chain by stuffing the money in my sock drawer. \n\nIf the Fed goes out and buys something for $1, the hope is it‚Äôll start the same chain of economic activity my $1 did. \n\nBut the bar is closed. So it skips step one and goes and buys the drink at the deli.  But no one is shopping much, so that deli owner doesn‚Äôt want to buy stuff either, so they just stuff it in their sock drawer.\n\nSo now the Fed has to introduce another dollar in hopes of starting up the chain. But everyone just keeps sticking them in their sock drawers. \n\nYes, sure, there‚Äôs tons more dollars, but they‚Äôre not being used. \n\n$1 being used 5 times is the same as 5 one dollar bills used once each before being stuffed in the sock drawer. In both cases it‚Äôs $5 worth of transactions. Since it‚Äôs the same dollar amount funding the same number of transactions, prices aren‚Äôt going to go up. \n\nThe potential problems come later when people start spending normally and everyone busts open their sock drawers and all those dollars that had gone unused start competing with each other to buy stuff. \n\nMe, the deli owner, everyone pulls out their dollar and start bidding up the price of things. \n\nThat‚Äôs when inflation would happen.\n\nAnd the Fed‚Äôs idea is that, at this point, it starts selling all the stuff it bought when it introduced those dollars, and does so until those dollars are removed from the economy, and it‚Äôl returns back to how things were at the beginning.\n\nThat‚Äôs the goal. That‚Äôs the hope. \n\nIt doesn‚Äôt always work though. That may not be able to undo it and we‚Äôll see the inflation. \n\nor people never bust open their sock drawers, and so no matter how often the Fed prints more and more money, nothing happens. \n\nIn fact, if people keep stuffing them in sock drawers faster than the fed can print them, the number of dollars being used could actually decrease and lead to deflation. \n\nThat‚Äôs essentially what happened to Japan in the 1990s. They kept printing and printing and saying, ‚Äúyour goddamn sock drawers are overflowing with cash! Go use it!‚Äù But since no one was using it, prices kept falling. Problem is, if prices keep falling, the incentive is to hold off on buying, which means even more reason to keep it money stashed in the drawer, and the cycle perpetuates. No amount of money printing will cause inflation if no one uses the money.  Stacks of in your money in sock drawer isn‚Äôt any more inflationary than your socks are. It only becomes inflationary when you spend it. \n\nThe real world is more complicated, but the general idea is the same. It‚Äôs not just how much money there is, but also whether or not (and how frequently) that money is being used for transactions that matters. \n\nSo, in the end, if activity normalizes and they can unwind, no inflation. If they they can‚Äôt unwind, inflation. If activity doesn‚Äôt normalize, potentially deflation."}

I previously spent 3 years of my life backpacking, just hopping between hostels around the world. Last year, I was invited to spend a week at the Cheval Blanc in the Maldives and it was a truly eye-opening experience, the first time I got to experience real luxury.\n\nI'd really like to start my retirement with a bang. What FAT destinations can you recommend? And perhaps more importantly, which luxury travel advisors?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWhoa, I didn't expect such massive response. This has been super helpful.\n\nI especially wanted to thank \/u\/CupResponsible797 for putting me in touch with Berkeley Travel, communicating with the team there has been super impressive. I'll be starting my first trip with them in just a couple of days.","answer":"Destinations? If you‚Äôre into Maldives, go to Velaa instead. It‚Äôs better than CB. I think Maldives is pretty boring though, St Barth offers a much more rounded paradise island experience IMO. Some argue that the CB is the best hotel on St Barth, I‚Äôd go for Eden Rock though.\n\nDo some classics, go to Paris and stay at George V. Go spend a week at FS Cap Ferrat. Spend another week relaxing in Park Hotel Vitznau before heading to MO Lake Como. Spend another week or two at FS Florence before heading to Rome for a private Vatican tour. The sky is the limit.\n\nWant to do something crazy? Charter a private jet to Antarctica https:\/\/white-desert.com\/\n\nWhy stop there?

Go see the norther lights at the Deplar Farm in Iceland.\n\nOh yeah, don't forget to book Courchevel for this winter while there's still availability. Cheval Blanc is probably full already.\n\nAs far as travel advisors go, I‚Äôll paste my previous comment below. A lot of the stuff about travel agency bookings being good value probably isn‚Äôt relevant to you but if you want the best of the best advising you, these are the right people.\n\nI could write so much about this, at this point my travel agent\/concierge service handles most aspects of my day-to-day life.\n\nI've been using [Berkeley Travel](http:\/\/berkeleytravel.co.uk), a London based agency offering services globally. They charge no fees for travel, just take the standard commissions properties offer to travel agencies. However, because of this they're not really interested in clients with annual travel budgets below 250k.\n\nIs it worth it? Absolutely. For years I used to book directly, but reading Flyertalk I eventually realised that I could save tons of money booking through somebody who has more negotiating power than me. Good agents will have contracted rates and partnership agreements with top properties, offering huge discounts and guaranteed upgrades.\n\nFor example, Berkeley is a Four Seasons preferred partner and they've managed to arrange incredible (even triple category) upgrades at multiple Four Seasons properties for me.\n\nMoney isn't the most important thing though, it's just the convenience of all of it. Before I had my PA handling my bookings for me, she's incredible but she's just not a luxury travel specialist. She'll fight for me, but she hasn't actually visited the properties I want. She's got no problem spending hours on the phone, but doesn't have direct contacts at the properties or restaurants I want to book. \n\nThe agency I work with has me in a Whatsapp group with a bunch of people able to provide expert advice within a couple of minutes. And because they actually go to the same destinations as I do, they tend to have direct lines for restaurant managers, maitre d's, etc - often enabling them to get me last minute tables even at super busy places.\n\nOverall, I think the most important thing is to avoid the big shops. The big ones like essentialist, mrandmrssmith and velocity black are all a disaster. You want to work with a small team of experts where everyone knows you and your preferences, not with a glorified amex concierge hiring hundreds of people with little industry expertise.\n\nIf you're interested in a personal referral, feel free to message me directly."}

{"question":"From what I've read house prices being high and rapidly increasing is a good sign they may crash. I've read this in property investment guides and online about timing the cycle. Everywhere I look seems to assume that property prices will continue to rise well into the 2040s!\n\nNow I've read the average baby boomer will die in 2034, which will create a buyers market but no analysts from property firms or banks seem to agree. My sneaking suspicion is that they are wealthy and benefit from increasing house prices and wouldn't want anyone to know the party has to end eventually.","answer":"Your question seems to be entirely focused on \"the hosing market\" in the United States, so I'm only going to speak to that. \n\nThe suggestion that \"no one\" thinks the housing market will \"crash\" is just wrong.  There are plenty of people who think that. But even though home prices have risen quickly over the past year, the idea that there will be a \"crash\" is dubious. \n\nYes, real estate can be used as an asset like stocks, silver, gold, bitcoin, etc., all of which saw dramatic increases in the last year. But unlike bitcoin, which only has value if people agree it has value, a house is also a consumable (i.e. a place to live).  So while bitcoin could crash to $0, real estate wouldn't \"crash\" in the same way because it has an inherent, useful value.\n\nLooking at real estate specifically, there are (at least) three factors  driving the increase in home prices:\n\n1. Mortgage rates are [near record lows](http:\/\/www.freddiemac.com\/pmms\/pmms30.html). When we \"[reduce the interest rates faced by households\" that will \"push prices up](https:\/\/www.bis.org\/publ\/cgfs64.pdf).\" That is, when mortgage rates go down a person can afford a home with a higher sticker price because their overall monthly mortgage payment stays the same.\n2. The supply of houses for sale (relative to the demand for houses) is also [near record lows](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/MSACSR). When there's less supply to meet the demand, you're going to see price increases.\n3. The US population keeps growing, but the amount of land remains the same. There are simply more people competing for the same sq ft of land.\n\nThe first two factors will let up eventually. When the economy recovers and inflation picks up, the Fed will raise interest rates and unwind its balance sheet. That will cause mortgage rates to rise, and prices to fall. But the Fed knows not too do that too quickly and cause a \"crash.\" Likewise, higher home prices will incentivize builders to create more housing and for people to sell. But it takes time to build new housing so there wouldn't be a sudden \"crash,\" and people would be less likely to sell if there were a \"crash,\" causing supply to dry up. The third factor will continue to push prices up: The population is growing and [will continue to grow for decades to come](https:\/\/www.census.gov\/content\/dam\/Census\/library\/publications\/2020\/demo\/p25-1144.pdf) (even considering the death rate for \"the average baby boomer\"), and the amount of land isn't.\n\nHome prices will almost certainly *rise more slowly* in the future. They might even go down a bit. But a decrease would likely occur slowly rather than as a \"crash.\" A \"crash\" happens when the price declines dramatically and unexpectedly. That is unlikely because (a) homes have an inherent value, like I mentioned above, and (b) none of what I'm discussing is ground breaking. \n\nI'm not saying there can't be a \"crash\" in home prices. We saw that in 2008. But it's precisely *because* we have a good understanding of what happened in 2008 that we're unlikely to see it happen again.  In spite of COVID, the current [delinquency rate](https:\/\/www.corelogic.com\/insights-download\/loan-performance-insights-report.aspx) is dramatically lower than the mortgage delinquency rate [after the great recession](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/DRSFRMACBS). A big reason for that is that lenders have been much more strict since 2008. In 2006, subprime mortgages made up [about 20%](https:\/\/www.recenter.tamu.edu\/articles\/tierra-grande\/Lingering-Effects-of-Subprime-Lending#:~:text=Subprime%20mortgages%E2%80%94broadly%20defined%20as,to%2020%20percent%20in%202006) of the overall mortgage market, whereas today they make up less than 5%. In other words, home prices may be high today, but people with mortgages are more creditworthy and are better able to afford the mortgages.  So we're less likely to see a huge foreclosure spike, meaning we're less likely to see a dramatic increase in the number of homes for sale, meaning prices are unlikely to \"crash,\" per se.\n\n**To the hundred plus people downvoting the automod and complaining you don't see any responses:** The reason there aren't any approved responses to this thread is because literally none of the dozen plus comments in the queue cite to a single source of any kind. Many of the comments are just one sentence long or say something like \"here's my take,\" \"I'm not an expert,\" I \"believe,\" or this is \"my guess.\" Rule II says: \n\n&gt;All claims (and especially claims in top-level comments) should be rooted in economic theory and empirical research - not opinions, anecdotes, lay speculation, or personal politics.

Emeritus professor Utsa Patnaik estimated under the British regime, about **1. 6 trillion people had died.**\n\nWould like to know how far these large numbers are true.","answer":"I was trying to track down the original article by Utsa Patnaik but I couldn't find it. Part of where that $50 trillion comes from is the \"compounding at 5%\" assumption. 5% is a very high interest rate over 250 years - ¬£1 in 1772 compounded forward at 5% becomes nearly ¬£200,000 in 2022. If you only adjusted for UK inflation, which averaged 1.9% over the last 250 years, ¬£1 in 1772 only becomes about ¬£100 in 2022. To try and make sense of the influence of that we can look at the average flow of transfers per year between 1765 and 1938 that you'd need to get to $45 trillion with compounding to the present day at 5%; [I calculate that as $9 million per year](https:\/\/www.wolframalpha.com\/input?i=%2845*10%5E12%29%2F%28%5Csum_%7Bx%3D80%7D%5E%7B253%7D+1.05%5Ex%29), which is still a large sum, but if you change the compounding rate to 2% you instead get a total of $69 billion - almost a thousand times less than the figure Patnaik suggests. So the compounding assumption makes a big difference to the total figure.\n\nStill, is a flow of $9 million a year accurate? It's certainly true that there was a good deal of direct wealth extraction by British people from India, with a minority of British people involved with the East India Company getting filthy rich at the expense of Indians, to say nothing of the direct human rights atrocities and murder (William Dalrymple and Anita Anand's ongoing *Empire* podcast has some vivid details about what the British did in India). But there's a specific figure claimed here. Patnaik seems to equate \"drain\" with India's export surplus. Usually, exports are not a drain on a country because the countries that import the goods have to pay for them with something. The argument Patnaik makes is that the colonial setup allowed the British effectively to get exports from India without paying anything for them, so that the total value of the exports was all drained from India. Whether that's true is both an economic and a historical claim, and I don't know enough about the history to evaluate it. But [this comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/gc3ifr\/utsa_patnaik_claims_that_the_british_siphoned_45\/fp9yyx0\/) on \/r\/AskHistorians argues against the claim that all exports from India constituted drain, which would imply Patnaik is also overstating the flow of resources from India.\n\nThe 1.6 trillion people died figure is surely a typo for billion, a trillion is simply not a possible figure and it's not claimed by the other sources. The 1.8 billion deaths figure [seems to come from assuming](https:\/\/countercurrents.org\/polya201111.htm) that if the British had not ruled India, the annual death rate for India over the entire period would be 11 per 1000, which is the death rate of the US in the early 1920s; this doesn't seem like a remotely plausible assumption to me, but I'm no more a demographer than I am a historian.\n\nFinally, drain isn't necessarily the only way that Britain impoverished India. Acemoglu and Robinson have a lot of work on the importance of institutions in determining how fast a country grows. When the British were in India they set up institutions that were predominately extractive, aimed at taking wealth from the country rather than improving the lives of the people living there. Bad institutions can have persistent effects even after the British left, and may well have made India poorer by inhibiting its growth without actually making Britain commensurately richer."}

If the government spends that tax revenue on something that promotes economic growth, then the economic growth benefits of that can even out (or in some cases even result in a net positive benefit). \n\nWhen instead individuals either impose additional costs (bribes) or cause government spending to go to non-beneficial costs (kickbacks) you get more of the negative effects and less of the positive.

{"question":"I've been following \/r\/wallstreetbets for years. Usually just for a laugh as I am a stodgy buy and hold guy and don't speculate often. When I saw the $GME shit happening a week ago I thought it was pure stupidity and was not planning on investing. In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.\n\nHowever, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume. People are holding despite wall street twisting your arm and trying to make you tap out by only allowing you to sell. It's a beautiful thing to see. I don't think of my purchase as an investment, but as putting my own skin in the game as a fuck you against a rigged system.","answer":"I also only bought in because of sheer rage at the response.\n\n*edit: There are barriers of entry for hedge funds because they are considered high risk, but when the high risk comes calling, their buddies bail them out.

{"question":" Apparently the war costs Russia [$20 Billion a day](https:\/\/www.consultancy.eu\/news\/7433\/research-ukraine-war-costs-russian-military-20-billion-per-day),  and assuming that half of Russias $630 Billion foreign reserve remains  frozen - russia only has reserves for two weeks of war. One of which is  already over.\n\nObviously, Russia  also has a acces to rubel reserves. But you also have to consider that  the aftermath will also cost Russia a lot if they want to achive their  goal (an independant Ukraine). If Ukraine ties itself to the EU to  finance rebuilding, that would kinda miss the point of the whole  invasion.(Comparison: Rebuilding [Donbas alone was estimated to cost $20 billion](https:\/\/wiiw.ac.at\/ukraine-reconstruction-of-donbas-will-cost-at-least-usd-21-7-billion-or-16-of-ukraine-s-gdp-n-448.html)  \\- even without the additional damage of the invasion). So I'm just  ignoring that and say thats the money is allocated elsewhere.\n\nI  guess Russia is largely self-sustaining regarding the most basic needs  (food, water, energy), but rebuilding the army after the war seems like  it would eat all of russias reserves. All that wouln't really be a  problem if Russia would amass debts like any other country - but I can  hardly see anyone willing to lend them money to rebuild their army?\n\nTLDR: The numbers above seem to align with articels like [this](https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-10554269\/Ukraine-DESTROYS-Russian-convoy-Zelenskys-troops-derail-Kremlin-push-Kyiv.html),  claiming the war is over after 10 days.

One of which is  already over.\n\nI don't see much of a reason to assume that Russia is spending significant amounts of reserves on the war, at least not right now.\n\nI would consider reading that article, too. It's not just about explicit costs they have to pay for now, it's about the cost incurred by the loss of equipment and men, which actually make up the bulk of this cost.\n\n&gt;All that wouln't really be a  problem if Russia would amass debts like any other country - but I can  hardly see anyone willing to lend them money to rebuild their army?\n\nThey can borrow, just not from the western world.

How is that possible?\n\nSurprise surprise, war is expensive. But the upfront cost is not the full 20 billion, that's loss of equipment and men for the most part.

{"question":"If you buy a house for $30,000 and rent for $1,500 it would take you almost 2 years just to break even. So how do people become so rich by renting by properties? And how do they rent multiple properties at once when they‚Äôre not even breaking even on the first one?","answer":"It's a combination of a lot of things:\n\n1. Cash flow: after all expenses (including maintenance, operations, and debt servicing) the extra money accumulated each month. \n\n2. Loan pay down: Each month, they own more and more of the property. \n\n3. Appreciation: assuming 30,000 is the 20% down payment, the property purchased was $150,000. Gradually, the hope is for this to appreciate over time. This also works with rents. They may break even now or minimally cash flow, but over time rents generally increase. \n\n4. Leverage: going off the above point, they only paid $30,000, but are able to gain appreciation on an asset worth 150,000\n\n5. Scale: using legal tax loopholes you can trade up your property over time for larger and larger properties that can yield more of the above revenue streams at a larger scale. Trading your 150,000 building for a 300,000 building, then a 600,000 building, etc. \n\n6.

{"question":"Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders introduced a plan on Monday that would reverse President Donald Trump's tax cuts for businesses and return the corporate tax rate to 35% from its current 21%.\n\nThe Corporate Accountability and Democracy Plan would also eliminate many of the tax breaks and loopholes in the tax code and do away with off-shore tax havens.\n\nThe senator is also calling to democratize corporate boards, ban stock buybacks and diversify corporations.\n\nThe detailed plan includes these highlights, according to the campaign website:\n\n- Nearly half of the board of directors in any large corporation with at least $100 million in annual revenue, corporations with at least $100 million in balance sheet total, and all publicly traded companies would be directly elected by the firm's workers.\n\n- They would be required to consider the interests of all of the stakeholders in a company ‚Äì including workers, customers, shareholders and the communities in which the corporation operates.\n\n- Large-scale stock buybacks would be \"treated like stock manipulation\" via repeal of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-18.\n\n- Rules would be developed to diversify corporate boards \"ensuring a significant portion of every board be comprised of people from historically underrepresented groups.\" And they would require every corporation to \"complete an annual report that gives the compensation, gender, and racial composition of board and employees.\"\n\n[CNBC](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/amp\/2019\/10\/14\/bernie-sanders-would-raise-corporate-tax-rate-to-35percent-ban-stock-buybacks.html)","answer":"as we've learned with Donald Trump as President, we have a system of checks and balances that make proposals like this little more than headlines. this would never actually get passed, just like Elizabeth Warren's plans to break up big tech. \n\nPOTUS is not a dictator. he wouldn't have the power to do this himself, nor the support to make it a reality."}
{"question":"So unlike some of the guys on WSB I'm not stupid enough to think that there's a free money glitch in the market somewhere, hence my question is where I'm missing something: from my understanding, selling OTM covered calls on stocks you'd golf anyway can't result in an actual loss, ignoring missed capital gains of course. Is that true? You'd always get the premium and the worst that could happen is selling shares at an unexpected high price, sounds like too good to be true to me but I can't see any obvious error in my thinking. Am I right or do I belong to WSB","answer":"1. You discover CC as \"free money\" (**YOU ARE HERE**)\n2. You have success for X months writing CC against your ABC shares and collecting said \"free money\"\n3. After X months, ABC gets great news and ABC proceeds to rocket past your CC strike\n4. Knowing ABC is on a path towards the moon, you buy back your CC for a massive loss\n5. ABC proceeds to plummet the next several weeks as people take profits and ends up below your previously held CC strike that would have expired worthless\n6. You've learned your lesson and start writing CC again \n7. After X more months, ABC tanks on bad news\n8. You've studied up though and you know not to write CC below your cost basis so you baghold for X more months \n9. Finally, you write deep OTM CC to collect some pennies while waiting to drop off your bag\n10. ABC slowly climbs above your strike but you've studied more and know you can roll out for a credit to buy yourself time\n11. ABC has caught fire and proceeds to climb higher and higher\n12. You continue to roll horizontally without realizing slippage is costing you money\n13. Eventually, you are so deep ITM that your extrinsic value is near 0 and you can only roll out to 2029 to even move up one strike for a credit\n14.

{"question":"Hi, I'm a teenager looking to get into stocks to make some money and I'm unsure if I should invest in typical blue chips or go with penny stocks? I start with about $500 and trade with either ETrade or Scott trade. Any tips from anyone?","answer":"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\n\nUnfortunately for smart blokes like you or me, you cannot simply jump into stocks and make money.  That is called day trading, and for most people, you're going to have about the same outcome as betting blindfolded in a casino.  \n\nFirst, here's what you **don't** do:\n\n* Penny stocks.  This is the game of suckers, and is a great place to lose every single cent. Nobody has a method for making tons of money from penny stocks, and if they do, they sure as shit aren't sharing it with you in a newsletter.  Might as well play roulette.\n* If you invest with $500, commissions are going to eat you ALIVE.  You pay $4-7 per stock trade.  Trading with $50,000?  That's only about 0.2% that you need to make up.  Trading with $500?  You're going to be down 1-2% IMMEDIATELY after buying.  The market hasn't moved, and you're already at a loss!\n\nSo, here's what you **should** do:\n\n1. Leave this subreddit and head over to \/r\/personalfinance.  They sound the same, they're miles apart.  \n2. Read the links on the sidebar and in the wiki.  \n3. Given as you're a teenager, you probably don't need to worry about things like paying rent, right?  Or car payments?  Your parents are helping out?  If so, you can probably gloss over the emergency fund.\n4. If you do have some sort of payments you make, you will first want to put aside a couple months' expenses.  What if you get fired?  You don't want your car repossessed!  So have a backup fund like this.  Maybe you do already. \n\nNow, for investing!  You've got a couple options here.  \n\n1. Retirement - if you made this money at a job, you can report it as earnings and open up a Roth IRA.  The downside?  The money won't be available for, like, 45 years.  The upside?  It will have tremendous compounding power if you start early, and is tax-sheltered: no tax penalties when you take it out.  Vanguard is most likely the best choice for a company with which to start an IRA.  However, there's a $3k minimum, so you'll need to save a bit more.  EDIT: If you pick a target retirement date fund, the minimum is only $1k - thanks to \/u\/doomtop for catching this.\n2. Maybe you want this money back in under 45 years.  That's understandable.  In that case, open a brokerage account.  Again, Vanguard is great because you can trade all of their mutual funds for free - no commission!  See the bullet point above.  However, you'll still need a minimum of $1k to buy into their STAR funds.\n3. If you're interested in individual stocks, well, see the point above with penny stocks.  Individual stocks aren't quite like flushing your money down the drain, but they are much riskier than mutual funds, and in most cases you're wagering a limited upside against a massive potential downside.  If you're going to go this route, get it in your head right now that this money is gone.  Kaput.  Flushed.  Down the drain.\n\nI sound like a pretty pessimistic ass, don't I?  Well, I started an individual account for buying stocks back when I was a teenager.  I still have it now, half a decade later.  I put around $10k in.  It is worth $15k right now.  And unless you get incredibly lucky, you won't be generating 50% gains per year.  And if you are that lucky, you'd still be better off buying lotto tickets.\n\nNow, I've mentioned mutual funds and Vanguard a couple times.  Before you get into the market, educate yourself!  (And it's not a big leap for me to assume that you aren't, by the way - no stock pro ever trades penny stocks.)  Here are some recommendations:\n\n* Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin, especially if you want to change your emotional relationship with money.\n* The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley, especially if you have high expenses.\n* The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp; Broke by Suze Orman.\n* I Will Teach You to be Rich by Ramit Sethi.\n* The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing and\/or The Bogleheads' Guide to Retirement Planning, both by Larimore et al, which covers the investing philosophy espoused by most of r\/personalfinance.\n* A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel, especially if you aren't convinced that index-investing is right for you.\n* The Four Pillars of Investing by William Bernstein\n* Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey, especially if you are in more debt than you want to be.\n* The Richest Man in Babylon by George Clason, for timeless advice.\n\nIf you only read one from that list, by the way, make it \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street.\"  Trust me, it's worth your while.\n\n**TL;DR - Don't go into stock investing chasing ridiculous gains.  Consider setting up a retirement account.  Put money into indexed mutual funds, not single stocks.  If you buy single stocks, consider that money written off.  And, for the love of god, NO PENNY STOCKS.**\n\n^my ^fingers ^hurt ^now\n\nEDIT: Changed \"interest\" to \"tax penalties\" under the IRA, thank you very much to \/u\/ajfirecracker for catching my mistake."}

Which is a 50% increase in the price level per month. While what the US is seeing remains under 7% for the year, while the multi year trend has been barely any inflation at all. Moreover, pretty much everyone in economics is seeing the current inflation as mainly supply disruptions. And not a lasting trend. [The bond markets](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-12-10\/citi-s-bailin-says-bond-market-shows-inflation-is-transitory), which is the private sector entity with the most skin in the game concerning long  term or spiking inflation, is not pricing in any significant inflation expectations. \n\nBasically, people in the crypto markets don't understand economic fundamentals.

If you want to be a serious investor and see enough returns from trading to turn it into successful career you're gonna have to put in at the dozens to hundreds of hour studying, reading, watching tutorial guides and lessons. Navigating the minefield of which trading courses are real and which are scams. Then trading with a demo account for at least 6 months to a year before even getting started with real money. \n\nThen when you start putting money you're going to have to accept losses as you go forward and gain experience, managing the anxiety and stress that comes with trading.\n\nNot to mention balancing real life and everything with this.

{"question":"So today I went on www.bittrex.com to create an account and deposited roughly 26 BTC and traded them for other coins. Of course before doing this I did the basic verification, phone verification and enhanced verification and the 2FA authentication. I tested everything out and everything seemed fine...  Then I logged out at 18:54:27 2 Hours later I come home and try to log in and it says that Bittrex is checking for my browser and that this might take up to 5 minutes. Few minutes later it goes through and asks me for my 2FA which I provide. Again it takes a long time and ends up failing. So I wait a bit and do the whole process again and when I finally log in I notice that everythings gone... All my coins were sold for btc and gone. So I check the history and this is what I see...

{"question":"Wall Street has essentially no artificial restriction on the amount of people who can achieve the credentials required to enter the industry, unlike, say, medicine, which is restricted by the amount of medical school graduates, which is turn restricted by the number of medical schools. Also, it is not a winner take all industry, the way, say, social media or entertainment is. To that end, why are investment banks and hedge funds able to maintain such high margins and salaries that aren‚Äôt present in other fields? \n\nOddly, in spite of there being orders of magnitudes more hedge funds now than in 1980, there is very little in the way of price competition. The 2 and 20 compensation model has remained the standard in spite of middling performance from most funds. How is the sector able to get away with this when other sectors are not? For example, structural engineers aren‚Äôt able able to charge 2% of a buildings construction cost annually in perpetuity as long as it doesn‚Äôt fall down because there are other firms that will work for $150\/man hour with no residuals. Why hasn‚Äôt this happened in finance?\n\nHowever, on the other hand, unlike hedge funds, there seem to be essentially no startup investment banks. If you look at the top investment banks, basically none were founded recently (mergers excluded). One would think that the profitability of the sector would drive lots of startups, but it doesn‚Äôt happen.\n\nWhat economic factors make the financial sector unique in being able to prevent competition from destroying their huge profits and commensurate wages?","answer":"For the investing industry, there is actually a fair amount of competition. The average hedge fund [only lasts for five years](https:\/\/ftalphaville.ft.com\/2014\/07\/31\/1913792\/most-hedge-funds-fail\/), while [the average mutual fund fares marginally better at 8.6.](https:\/\/www.visualcapitalist.com\/can-mutual-fund-get-better-age\/) The comparison of compensation scheme to structural engineers is rather unfair: a construction company is done once the building is complete, while a hedge fund continues to actively manage your money the entire time you keep it with them, so charging a percentage of the total assets every year is much more warranted. However, you're right that the infamous 2 and 20 is exorbitant. The good news is that competition is working! [Fees are declining, with only 30% insisting on the traditional 2 and 20.](https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/only-a-third-of-hedge-funds-charge-2-and-20-fees-says-expert-1541851200) More generally, thanks to competition from low cost index funds, [money is drastically flowing away from actively managed funds](https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/outflows-inflows-active-passive-stock-funds-51571439212), and some of their largest clients like the [California pension system](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-pensions-calpers-hedgefunds\/calpers-dumps-hedge-funds-citing-cost-to-pull-4-billion-stake-idUSKBN0HA2D120140916) have sworn off hedge funds. It took a while, but over time, the sheen of active management and their (usually unfulfilled) promises of outperforming the market has worn off, and they're being competed away by lower cost alternatives.\n\nAs for investment banking, the relevant competitive angle is relationships with the CFOs and CEOs at potential client companies. Large firms like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley provide enough continuity that new entrants into the investment banking industry can develop those relationships as they rise up the ranks, so that by the time they become managing directors they are already chummy with their decision making counterparts. And indeed, most of a managing director's time is spent not doing market research or detailed quantitative analysis but instead [cultivating their relationships with clients](https:\/\/www.mergersandinquisitions.com\/investment-banking-career-path\/) so that when a CFO is contemplating a capital raise or M&amp;A transaction, the name they know and trust is yours. The idea that competition is based not around price or competence but rather networking may be gauche, but for better or worse it's how the industry works. And because those relationships are very scarce, the people who have them are able to extract large rents.\n\nAll that said, there *is* competition in the investment banking industry, and even new entrants! Most new entrants are what's called [\"boutique investment banks.\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boutique_investment_bank) Such banks are usually founded by a former managing director at a large who has decided that he can leverage his relationships without the corporate name to help him; for example, [Qatalyst, one of the most prominent investment banks for the tech industry, was founded by Frank Quattrone, who was a former star managing director at Morgan Stanley's tech investment banking group in Menlo Park](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frank_Quattrone). However, you'll still see the established names like Goldman or Morgan on any deals that a boutique bank facilitates. That's because investment banking often requires a large balance sheet to help finance transactions. While a top managing director can take his relationships with him when he starts his boutique firm, he can't take the balance sheet as well. So rather than try to accumulate enough capital to run an entire deal in house, most boutiques will instead partner with the larger and older firms, where the boutique is providing most of the strategic direction and advice but the older firm is making their balance sheet available for a smaller cut of the fees.\n\n**TLDR: Hedge funds actually *are* being competed away. For investment banks, the relevant dimension is their relationships with CFOs and CEOs, which cannot be competed away except by new firms founded by industry veterans.**"}

Is supply and demand really in doubt? Or are these just fringe positions that aren't backed up by research?","answer":"Wikipedia is weirdly a bad source for information on economics. It skews much more heterodox than what the majority of economists believe.

Anyways, in order:\n\n1.

The administrative prices argument is usually based on the idea that when you ask businesses how they set prices many will tell you they take their costs and add a profit margin on top of that. My response is that 1) businesses habitually say things that are incorrect about their own businesses (see any business arguing increased taxes or minimum wages will cause mass layoffs) and 2) as long as there's competition firms could throw darts at a board to set prices and the results would be the same as if they set prices to maximize profit (because only the most profitable firms survive)"}

What is also happening though is the oil industry, like every other industry, is having a labor and supply chain problem. The labor that they laid off in 2020 and 2021 is not returning in 2022. In addition it takes equipment and material to restart idle wells and that equipment and material is in short supply because of supply chain problems.\n\nNow then in addition Russian exports have received sanctions making them unavailable to sell in the countries that are issuing the sanctions. In response Russia has cut off oil and gas delivery to a number of European countries. Also the Nord Stream II pipeline that was expect to enter service delivering natural gas to Europe has not been started. \n\nIs it partially Putin's fault, yes, is partially because we are still in a pandemic and supply chains are still messed up, yes. Is it easy and politically expedient to blame it all on Biden or Putin, yes. Do people want to blame someone for a complex problem that has no solution, yes."}
{"question":"I read a washington post op\/ed saying that Biden's new loan forgiveness plan is regressive and mostly helps higher earning individuals. Is that the case? If it really is a regressive policy, why does it seem that its mostly left leaning progressives that are celebrating it?","answer":"The argument is about people who *after* finishing college will be well enough off that financial assistance becomes questionable.\n\nFinishing college comes with a huge earnings premium. The average college graduate earns roughly *double* in their lifetime compared to the average highschool graduate.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/policy2020\/votervital\/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.clevelandfed.org\/newsroom-and-events\/publications\/economic-commentary\/economic-commentary-archives\/2012-economic-commentaries\/ec-201210-the-college-wage-premium.aspx\n\nSo, people who attend college are on average much better off than those who don't. And of course people who don't attend college don't have student loans and therefore don't benefit from student loan forgiveness. Because of that, it's seen as a handout to at least the rich*er* part of the population.\n\nOf course that doesn't mean you can't make an argument for student loan forgiveness for the part of the population who have student loan debt and don't earn substantially more than highschool grads.\n\nAlso, there are at least some caps. People with incomes above 125k don't benefit. But then, that's still over 3x as much as the median personal income. Handing $10000 to someone who earns 100k a year is still regressive. Not to mention that it's an argument about *future* earnings as well. Maybe you're still in College, earning like 10k a year at some shitty sidegig, but if you *will* earn 100k+ a few years down the line, handing you student loan forgiveness is still regressive.\n\n&gt;If it really is a regressive policy, why does it seem that its mostly left leaning progressives that are celebrating it?\n\nBecause it's mostly politics and arguments tend to be rather dumb.\n\nBlanket student loan forgiveness is regressive. That doesn't mean that nobody is struggling or that you can't make an argument for those who could actually benefit from some help. But ultimately these discussions tend to be either slapfights or circlejerks, people aren't discussing the nuances of for which people it does and doesn't make sense."}
{"question":"I am 25 years old and just started earning 18 lpa in hand. My location will be gurgaon and I think I will be able to live in 50,000 rs per month. That leaves me with 1 lakh rs to spare every month. I already have a sip of 28000 per month. I don‚Äôt want to do debt investment as I am already investing 2 LPA in epf (deducted from my ctc of 22.5 lpa). Should I stick to mutual funds or try direct stocks ?\n\n\nEdit: I am a Software Engineer from a Tier 2 college, many people are asking.","answer":"Step 1: Emergency Fund: Before doing anything else, start with 6-12 months of expenses (50k x 12) and stash it away in an absolutely liquid investment - liquid meaning one that is near instantly convertible into cash - something like an FD. One additional point - this has to be separated from your regular savings account, so that you are not tempted to spend it unless it is a true emergency. \n\nThe idea of the emergency fund is to give you freedom. Let‚Äôs say your job turns crappy and you want to leave. If you are dependent on the salary, you can‚Äôt just up and leave. But if you have 12 months stashed away, you know you can take the time to breathe and search for a job that you truly like. Next, think of the power it gives you in a salary negotiation. You walk in not needing the job that instant. You are not stressed about your expenses and relying on whatever the HR of the new company throws at you. Instead, you have the ultimate power to walk away from the negotiation if you have to. Finally, it benefits you in case, god forbid, you lose your job for whatever reason. \n\nThe emergency fund is the last you draw from and first you refill. Remember, if you ever draw your emergency fund down, your first priority is to fill it back up.\n\nStep 2: now that you have an emergency fund, you can start to think of investments. First up, tax saving ones - Section 80C. Google this to know more but my suggestion here is ELSS. Maximize the annual limit of 1.5 lakh in one or more ELSS schemes to claim this tax benefit. \n\nStep 3: Now, you are getting close to investing, but you aren‚Äôt there yet. Think of massive unexpected expenses that you cannot cover out of pocket and insure against them - health insurance, life insurance, term life insurance etc. Health insurance is a must, but the others depend on your needs, and the needs of your dependents if any. \n\nStep 4: we made it to investing land! Do you fancy losing half your money tomorrow and taking 7 years to get back to the original principal while losing value to inflation? If your answer is no, and it should be, then you should diversify. Again, you are young, so you can afford to take more risk, but it should still be diversified. The exact allocation is up to you, but consider equities (stocks), bonds (corporate, government), commodities, precious metals, real estate etc. Remember to save fees wherever possible, 1% fee compounded over decades will destroy returns - ex: choose direct mutual funds instead of regular. The investments in this step are long-term, long-term meaning until retirement or next milestone (marriage - please invite only 50 people and get married on the cheap - no one cares these days and if they do, that‚Äôs on them; house, whatever other expense but at least a decade time horizon).\n\nYou check on Step 4 investments annually and adjust (rebalance) to bring the allocation back to your target allocation + change the target allocation itself to go more conservative as you age.\n\nStep 5: Some fun money! This is the fun part. What‚Äôs the new thing? Solano? NFTs? DeFi? Options trading? Something else? \n\nThis category is to satisfy your craving to be in on the action. Remember that you have stashed away a majority of your money towards long-term goals in Step 4. So this is the small amount that‚Äôs left that you are willing to lose in its entirety but also willing to take the risk to see if it pans out. \n\nStep 5 isn‚Äôt just a gimmick. Psychologically, having a small amount of your portfolio to play with for high-risk active investing makes you far less likely to touch the rest of your portfolio than if you had none at all. If you have zero allocated to this category, you become tempted to gamble (yes, most of those, regardless of what anyone says, are risky gambles) with your large savings.\n\nThat‚Äôs it my friend. Most of this stuff is on autopilot, you get to have your fun on the weekends, focus on your life and career and not worry everyday because you have a plan and you are sticking to it. \n\nGood luck to the both of us! I am 2 years older than you are üòÖ"}
{"question":"I assume Santa uses magic to conjure up the materials needed to manufacture the various toys.  I also assume his elves work for free (maybe they get some room and board, but that too is provided via magic), and they can perform specialist tasks, like forging microchips for game systems, etc.  His reindeer also serve as a super efficient global distribution network, so he doesn't need to hire any deliverymen or procure any delivery services.  With all these presents being delivered to Christmas trees around the world without contributing anything at all to the global economy, what economic impacts can we expect?  Mass unemployment?  Commodity crashes? Deflationary pressure?  Inverted yield curves?  How bad is it going to be?","answer":"Santa drives the price of toys and manufacturing labor down each Christmas. So the supply curve shifts right. Christmas however temporarily increases demand, so there are higher goods supplied at the same price point.\n\nSince Christmas has been going on for years predictably the market expects it and corrects itself in small increments, so there are no large changes to the market.\n\nAfter Christmas demand for toys goes down, and the labor supply from the elves will not be seen till the next year. This is a bit hard to track how much they are paid because it appears Santa collects payment in milk andcookies. We need more research and need to index cookie prices. Further we would need to take into account store bought vs home made, the amount of cookies supplied per household, and type of cookie."}

If you find it odd that auctions could be so important, think of auctions as devices used to allocate resources or goods and services. \n\nA well designed auction will result in a price and quantity where the good\/service is provided by the sellers with the lower cost and\/or bought by the buyers with the highest valuation, and both sides are satisfied with the outcome.\n\nThis is relevant because, even in the absence of competitive markets, it's possible to find an efficient price and quantity. It could also reduce the incentives to collude. \n\nThat's one of the reasons auction theory is so important for other economic theory but also for real world applications. And I don't mean only for cattle or ebay auctions, a famous example is the UK electric power auction.

It is a hypothesis that financial players on wallstreet have been committing crimes for decades and in doing so they are robbing the general public.

In January of 2021, the thesis was all but \"proved\" when we saw the price squeeze from a few dollars to over 500$ in less than a couple of days. The thesis was all but proved!! Since that time, there is enough evidence to show that the amount of shares sold short are even greater than last January.

With the way the property prices are going, we might not be able to afford a house like this in a couple of years.  \n\n\nOur spreadsheets add up, I'm just looking for validation, would you go for it, or too risky?","answer":"Let's run some numbers to validate whether you better off keeping your money in index funds, or taking a mortgage with a lower LTV.\n\nIf you take a 90% LTV mortgage:\n\n* You need ¬£55k deposit and a ¬£495k mortgage\n* According to MSE's best buy comparison, the best rate available from a mainstream lender for this mortgage is 2.5%\n* That means you would be paying **¬£12,375 a year in interest**\n\nIf you take a 85% LTV mortgage:\n\n* You need a ¬£82.5k deposit and ¬£467.5k mortgage\n* According to MSE's best buy comparison, the best rate available from a mainstream lender for this mortgage is 2.14%\n* That means you would be paying **¬£10,004 a year in interest**\n\nThe difference between the deposits is ¬£27.5k, and the difference in interest is ¬£2,371 per year.\n\n¬£2,371 on ¬£27,500 is 8.6%.\n\nTherefore, by selling your ISAs to get a 15% mortgage, **you are getting a guaranteed return of 8.6%** on the additional money you are putting into your house deposit. Remember that lowering the LTV brings the cost of the entire mortgage down - not just the cost of the additional deposit.\n\nThis return is **guaranteed, risk free** and is **higher than the long term average** of 7-8% that has historically been generated by the global stock markets.\n\nI conclude that you will be better off selling down more of your ISAs and increasing your house deposit to at least 85% LTV - when compared with taking a 90% LTV mortgage and keeping your ISAs.\n\nPersonally I would put money into the house until you get down to 80% LTV. After that, you start getting competitive mortgage rates and the returns diminish, so that's the time to focus on your S&amp;S ISA again.\n\nEDIT: Wow, this is my most upvoted post ever. Thanks for the upvotes and awards everyone!"}

That's a lot of money to lose and I understand you're struggling to cope with it.\n\nThe real advice I see you're asking for is \"how do I make this money back the fastest?\"\n\nThis is called chasing your losses. It's a symptom of a gambling addiction and is an emotional impediment that makes you a danger to yourself when trading.\n\nOthers have already recommended taking time off and paper trading, but I think you are too eager to see some immediate upside to take that advice.\n\nSo here is my recommendation: move into common shares for awhile. \n\nYou're currently gambling with options, and are now asking whether you should buy LEAPS on a company that's up 150% since they direct listed in September at $10. \n\nI understand you want to leverage your remaining capital as much as possible, but over leveraging yourself in calls is what caused the loss in the first place.\n\nIf you believe PLTR will go up (which is why you are considering buying long dated ATM Call options) then buy shares in increments of 100. From there sell Covered Calls. Yes you limit your upside, but this the kind of risk management you need right now.\n\nThis gives you time to watch and learn from the stock. You'll be able to predict it's movements better over time.

{"question":"i.e. What have economists discovered in the last 50 years?\n\nA lot has happened since the 1970s, like the two oil shocks, US stagflation, fall of the Soviet Union, 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nHas economics undergone any fundamental shifts over this period of time? Has there been any breakthroughs or major shifts of thought?","answer":"Probably the biggest advancements in economics over that time period would be developments in computation which have allowed for development of more advanced data methods. Economic data is very plentiful in the 21st century and new methods emerging to leverage that data have also followed suit and resulted in their own developments. The growth of the industrial optimization field is a good example of how both data and method have evolved with computational ability to expand knowledge of industrial methods.\n\nAnother major growth area has been behavioral economics. A lot of new research in this field has emerged since the 1990s and especially in the 21st century, and although doesn't originate in the past 50 years (some behavioral economics can be found as earlier as Adam Smith), much of the current literature is based on findings that have only emerged in the last 30 or so years.\n\nFinally, changes to the structure of the global economy, especially the end of the Bretton-Woods system in the early 1970s, has resulted in all sorts of advancements and modernization in finance and currency. Financial markets look nothing like they did 50 years ago, and floating exchange rates have also resulted in a bunch of emergent areas of study as well (exchange rate pass through, currency markets and arbitrage, etc.). For the most part though, computation may arguably one of the biggest contributors to facilitating modern advancements as far as I'm aware."}

{"question":"I hang with you guys, not the YOLO's at r\/WSB, but I'm reading tonight and they're all convinced that the crazy run on GME is just starting (they're also high on BB).\n\nMaybe I'm just feeling a little FOMO, but I have some FU money and thinking about throwing some money at GME and BB next week just for the rush. Anyone else thinking about it?","answer":"What is going on: there are more shares of GME shorted than actually exist. That means that if the stock goes up for *any* reason, short sellers come under pressure to buy shares to close their short positions. But when the first short seller cracks and buys shares (taking a loss) they inadvertently drive the price up further, adding to the pressure on the other short sellers. Soon it‚Äôs a race to buy shares, but there simply aren‚Äôt enough to go around, so the price skyrockets before falling back down as shareholders finally take profits and sell. This is called a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù. The only way a short squeeze is averted is if the stock price drops for some reason (like bad news from the company). GME is at ATH right now so it‚Äôs very unlikely that the short sellers will get out alive. It‚Äôs a matter of *when* they start to crack, not *if*. By all accounts they haven‚Äôt cracked yet, so the short squeeze hasn‚Äôt actually started.\n\nWhat happened Friday was a ‚Äúgamma squeeze‚Äù, which is unrelated to a short squeeze, but happens when call options are being bought extremely fast and the stock price is rising, which indirectly causes market makers to buy massive volumes of shares to hedge, driving the price higher, and so on.\n\nThe high probability of a massive short squeeze caused retail traders to plow money into shares and calls on Friday, which in then caused a gamma squeeze, causing the stock price to go higher, making the short squeeze even *more* likely.\n\nIf you have gambling money and you want to take part in this unique event, you either buy shares or call options. Shares are safer (since no matter when the squeeze occurs, you‚Äôre ready, while calls expire) but calls give you leverage. Calls, even far OTM and short expiry calls, are likely to be very expensive. Everybody knows this is going down, it‚Äôs been covered on major news, and retail money is flooding in as people try to get onboard before the shorts crack.\n\nEdit: either pony up for gold so I don‚Äôt have to look at ads or save your money for GME shares Monday morning"}

{"question":"So Daron Acemoglu (and 2 other economists) wrote a paper titled \"Can't We All Be More Like Scandinavia\" in which they argued that countries with \"cuddly capitalism\" (countries with generous welfare states) free ride on countries with \"cutthroat capitalism\" (countries that don't have very generous welfare states) because the latter has longer working hours and more incentives for innovation while the former has less. \n\nThey essentially say that innovation from \"cutthroat capitalist\" countries has a positive externality that benefits \"cuddly capitalist\" countries. \n\nTheir answer to the question overall is no, because (according to them) if everyone became like Scandinavia, then global growth rates would decrease due to less innovation.\n\nHere's their paper: https:\/\/scholar.harvard.edu\/files\/jrobinson\/files\/varieties_of_capitalism_april_9_2013.pdf\n\nIs this true? \n\nFrom what I know, voxeu responded to this paper and argued that Scandinavian countries may actually be MORE innovative when measuring triadic patents and other metrics like R&amp;D, venture capital, researchers per 1000 people employed, etc. \n\nHere's their response:  https:\/\/voxeu.org\/article\/nordic-innovation-cuddly-capitalism-really-less-innovative\n\nBut if I'm being blunt, I'm a layman when it comes to economics and thus im not very smart in this field. I felt way out of my depth reading these 2. \n\nSo I was hoping for your guys' insight because I'm not sure what the consensus is. Thank you very much ! :))","answer":"They do free ride off American innovation, but so does basically every other country. America is the #1 innovator in absolute terms because it is the largest developed country.\n\nIn per capita terms however, my personal view is that the Nordic countries *probably* are less innovative, but that this isn't necessarily due to their characteristics (higher taxes and redistribution). Its more that the USA is exceptional in some ways. The USA has a massive economies of scale advantage, being a single market the size of Europe, but far more integrated. Europe being damaged heavily after the two world wars allowed America to take the lead as a global power and establish itself as the global economic hub, the benefit of which is still seen today. As a result, the [USA has venture capital investment that dwarfs any European country](https:\/\/stats.oecd.org\/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=VC_INVEST) despite having higher taxes on corporations and capital in some cases (think California having a 44% corporate tax rate before TCJA and a 32% capital gains tax rate, both of which are far higher than nordic rates). Its actually rather common to have companies start up elsewhere but eventually move to California for its established base of talent despite the burden of higher taxes. \n\nAs a result of of these differences between the the nations, I think its somewhat flawed to present a simplistic and broad cross country comparison as evidence that \"cuddly capitalism\" would result in a decrease in innovation, considering that the USA actually has higher taxes on capital in its most innovative regions.\n\nTo push back a bit on the technical side of Acemoglu's study though, I think his usage of patents as a proxy for innovation is somewhat flawed because the [USA has recently seen an explosion in the number of patents, but no such increase in total factor productivity](https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/113th-congress-2013-2014\/reports\/49487-Innovation.pdf) (See page 34 specifically), implying that most of these patents likely aren't useful, making the number of patents a bad measure of innovation. As the [voxeu article you linked](https:\/\/voxeu.org\/article\/nordic-innovation-cuddly-capitalism-really-less-innovative) points out, different metrics of innovation do not support the claim that nordic countries are significantly less innovative. Its also worth noting that the [Global Innovation Index](https:\/\/www.globalinnovationindex.org\/analysis-indicator) ranks Sweden (#2) ahead of the USA (#3), but I think the index is mostly garbage, so I wouldn't put much stock into it.\n\nTLDR; USA likely is more innovative, but that it is due to USA's unique characteristics, and I do not think becoming more like the nordic countries would result in a decrease in innovation."}

I hear nothing but bad news about financial crisis all over the world, and it seems that there is a shortage of cash - like it is some sort of natural resource.\n\nPeople haven't stopped buying stuff.  They still need food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Taxes are still collected. Fines are still levied. \n\nSo where is all the money?  I mean, labor has been produced to make things and wages paid to the laborers. The things are purchased by other laborers, who were paid for producing goods or services, etc.  It's a closed loop, right? \n\nCan someone explain it like I'm five or something?","answer":"To summarize, the money never existed. The best example I can give is the housing bubble. Houses were being bought on credit worthiness and this pushed the house prices and values up as if the houses had been bought with real money. When people couldn't make their payments, the house prices crashed.\n\nThe boom and bust cycle is simply credit being overextended (boom) and when there is not enough money in the system for everyone to repay all their debts it crashes (bust).\n\nThe real question that people should be asking is not \"Where did all the money go?\", but \"Why is money issued by private banks?\"\n\nMoney is a social invention to facilitate trade. Should it not be like a public water utility? Counterfeiting is illegal except when a private bank does it. Money should not be variable in value and economics will never be a science if the measurement of value is not standardized. All natural sciences have standards of measurement like meters, joules, degrees, etc. Money must decrease in value constantly because all money is issued at interest. We essentially pay rent on all money that isssued and the interest can only be repaid if more money is created, once again at interest. This is why economists generally say some inflation is good. Finance has told them interest is a given on the issue of money when in reality, money is just an IOU that requires no such interest payment for it's issue.\n\nInterest should be made if a loan is issued against savings, but not for the simple issuance of money. There should be public banks that issue the money and private banks for investment. You can read more about this from reading about Arthur Kitson. In this way, the public controls the value of it's money, not private bankers that use the issue of money to transfer wealth to an idle financial class.\n\nIf you want to get into the differences between wealth and debt, read the work of Frederick Soddy. It's off topic from this thread but really interesting to see how he relates real science to economics and how our current economic system is not scientific in the least. Wealth is subject to the laws of thermodynamics while debt is an invention of the human will. Debt never rots or degrades with time and can expand exponentially through compound interest - nothing in the natural world does this."}

For normal US based corporations, what you have mentioned would be cause for concern.  However, Realty Income is actually a special kind of corporation known as a REIT, or Real Estate Investment Trust.  REITs are corporations that are exempt from most federal taxes, and in exchange are legally required to pass on over 90% of their Net Income under GAAP on to shareholders in the form of dividends.  Key word being \"Under GAAP.\"\n\nGAAP (or Generally Acceptable Accounting Principles) are the financial reporting standards required by US law.  They are strict, based in math, and very difficult to fabricate.  Unfortunately, when you are dealing with Real Estate, the mathematics of GAAP begin to break down.  This is due to a variety of reasons, but the short version is that taxes, depreciation, and amortization are required to be deducted from any number the corporation calls \"profit\" (Net Income, as GAAP calls it).  However, Real Estate remember, is for the most part an asset that increases in value.  Especially commercial real estate.\n\nI could honestly break Reddit's character limit on the complexities of Real Estate under GAAP (Whole Graduate level college courses have been taught on the subject) so I won't get into the weeds here, but the important part is that REITs have countered this issue by developing their own metric known as Funds From Operations (FFO).  It is, in all honesty, a more realistic, accurate measurement of what a REIT is actually earning, as they do not worry about depreciation, amortization, or most taxes.  This is why legitimate stock tracking websites like Seeking Alpha will list FFO statistics under the Income Statements of REITS.  [Here](https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/symbol\/O\/income-statement) is Realty Income's Financial Statements.  If you replace their measure of profit with the FFO, all of a sudden, Realty Income begins to look like a normal investment.  FFO per share over the last 12 months is $3.24.  So as of my writing this, Realty Income's P\/FFO ratio is 21.11, which is actually pretty good for this reliable of a dividend payer.  Their FFO payout ratio is between 80-90%, which is exactly where management wants it to be, as that is pretty normal for a REIT.  \n\nWhen it comes to growth, Real Estate companies rarely use cash to outright buy properties, as such a process is inefficient, as federal law requires them to pass on 90% of profits to shareholders.  So they must raise capital through either the issuance of shares, corporate bonds, or adding other forms of debt to their balance sheet.  A REIT stockpiling too much cash is seen as a bad thing, since they have access to cheaper forms of capital than you or I.  Exemption from most taxation means they can offer better rental rates to corporate clients, and as such are more likely to secure tenants, making them a safer investment for banks and other financial institutions.  The guaranteed dividends if profitable also make them an attractive investment to those seeking stable returns in uncertain markets."}

{"question":"People, when you post your success, please throw some bones in here for the rest of us. Too often I read people creating \"throw away\" accounts to humble brag their success and retire early, etc. PLEASE remember there is a super majority of us here who are still grinding the day to day - making ends meet. When you post your wins, congrats, but post some details on how you got there. Why did you choose your method vs others. I wanna read your thought logic, not just how much NW you have and what you started with. Help us connect the dots. Lift others up, not bring other down. This is not Instagram.\n\nEdit: \"making ends meet\" meaning trying to hit my investments, earnings and savings targets (not always easy).

I don‚Äôt make threads like that but I don‚Äôt support this. \n\n\nI‚Äôm happy for others. Simply seeing their success is both motivating and fun for me to read.

{"question":"From an unbiased stance, are there any negative economic impact for the American nation on a macro scale for just canceling the trillion dollars in student debt?","answer":"1.

{"question":"I read a lot of posts asking about surviving or at least building a financially smart life on a 'meagre' 60k wage. I earn about 30k as a social worker and do alright. I mean I have to manage spending of course, but I'm not in trouble or anything, and seem to be able to use advice here as well. But I'm just wondering: is this mainly a sub for the more wealthy?","answer":"I think the reason is that people that are on the lower earning side do not bother themselves with such subs as their key goal is to get to the end of the month. At least my personal interest with financial and FIRE subs grew as my income grew.\n\nThat saying 30k in my part of EU is a decent wage, maybe even on the higher side. So evaluate your own position only by size of income is not a right thing to do."}
{"question":"I can understand how other people touted as \"wealthiest person in the world\" got their wealth, for example:\n\n* Bill Gates gained his wealth because his Windows operating system is the dominant computer operating system\n* Jeff Bezos gained his wealth because his e-commerce business is widely used worldwide\n* Sergey Brin and Larry Page gained their wealth through creating the world's dominant search engine and web browser\n* Vladimir Putin gained his wealth through corruption at the head of a massive and resource-rich nation\n\nIn contrast:\n\n* SpaceX products and services are not as widely used as those of Microsoft, Amazon or Google\n* Tesla comprises less than 1% of the market share of automobiles worldwide\n* Elon Musk's other promises such as Hyperloop have been nothing but hot air","answer":"The vast majority of Elon Musk's net worth come from Tesla, so let's ignore the other things for now. \n\nTesla is currently the most valuable asset cat company in the world. In fact, it's worth more than the next 5 biggest combined. So it's easy to see how a major owner and leader of the by far most valuable car company in the world could have a high net worth. \n\nRemember those wealth number just list net worth. They are not just counting his cash in the bank. It's highly unlikely he could sell all his stock and realise that kind of money without the stock tanking.\n\nNow, from the way you've phrased your question or sounds like you doubt the value of Tesla. You may be right of course, and if you are his net worth will go down as others figure it out. However the reason a lot of people value it so highly goes something like this:\nA companies value is not determined by what its doing right now. If I had a dollar but knew it was about to turn into $100, I wouldn't sell it for a dollar. I wouldn't even sell it for $50, I'd probably value it at very close to $100. So people are looking at Tesla and trying to work out what it will turn into over the next decades. \nThey only sold a bit over 1% of new cars, but they certainly didn't sell them at the average price. These are expensive cars globally.\n\nNow we get to electric cars. A lot of people think there won't be many petrol cars sold in 10 to 20 years. Tesla sold double as many electric cars than its next competitor in 2021. So the bet is, is it easier for existing auto makers to switch their factories to electric cars? Or is it easier for Tesla to build new factories? If it is easier for existing car manufacturers to convert factories, how did Tesla get such a huge lead inf the first place?\n\nNow everything I've said about Tesla has little to do with economics and could be all wrong. But the stock is valued that high because there are people who believe it, and demonstrate that with their wallet by buying a piece of the company for what they think the company will be worth. Elon Musks net worth is calculated based on the amount investors show they believe the company is worth by buying shares, divide by the portion he owns.\n\nRemember Bill Gates didn't become a billionaire in the current era. He did it in the 80s. Only about 5 million PC's were sold that year. He was a billionaire long before his Microsoft was ubiquitous in every household. \n\nAnd so Elon Musk has a high net worth before his companies either have an impact commensurate with their valuations, or decline with his net worth to follow."}

{"question":"I'm no economist, and this is a bit cheeky, but I'm lost as to how Japan isn't a much stronger economy than they are.\n\nCurrently, they're ranked #3 in the world, which is pretty good. Especially given their not huge population of a little over 100M. But it seems like they should be higher.\n\nI can't think of many products where the Japanese version of that product isn't the best. They make the most reliable cars. The highest-quality pianos. 2\/3 of the most popular video game systems are Japanese, and they control a huge market of games for all three.\n\nJapan also has a massive amount of media in the form of TV shows and movies that have worldwide appeal. To be fair, Japan has some heavy competition with the USA here, but their own influence is huge. Japan also has a large amount of R&amp;D in technology, though it competes with the US and China here. Again, their influence is still large.\n\nTo tie this up further, Japan is incredibly safe and has a very hardworking population. Tokyo is quite possibly the best designed city in the world, and trains are basically always on time. This is all conducive to growth. I'm fairly certain that anyone who has been to New York, Shanghai, and Tokyo would rate Tokyo as the cleanest, safest, and most efficient of the three.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, there are some strong opinions here, so I'd like to hear it from an economist.

This occured at first because of the [1990s Japanese banking crisis](https:\/\/www.imf.org\/external\/pubs\/ft\/wp\/2000\/wp0007.pdf), and then because of a shrinking workforce and rising adult dependecy ratio. The demographic issue of an aging population is here to stay.  The Japanese are extremely adverse to allowing immigrants, and attempts to raise the fertility rate have had essentially no impact. There is essentially no plausible solution to their long term economic slowdown."}

(say a proprietary IP)","answer":"Yes. In fact, there are many advantages to being a (automated) retail investor\/trader. I won't distinguish automation as an advantage or disadvantage because it is simply a tool for executing strategies and not a strategy within itself. \n\nFirst and foremost, small trades (I mean &lt;$100k or so, assuming a liquid enough asset) do not really move markets, allowing your positions to effectively realize the full intended movement at the time of entering the trade. Second, and perhaps more importantly, retail order flow is considered \"non-toxic\" and often allows you to get better fills. That's right - market makers DO NOT want to trade against sophisticated institutions and will actively try to avoid their orders. However, retail order flow is literally just considered noise (as for the most part, it is), so market makers love to trade on it (think Robinhood). No matter how sophisticated your strategies might be, your trades will be considered retail and gobbled up by market makers, providing you with better fills. \n\nThe markets are so complex and there are so many opportunities for everyone involved.

{"question":"\n\nIt is not a hidden fact that the global waste management problem ¬†we face cannot be tackled by a handful of people or organisations. The willingness and contribution of the mass is the key in successfully achieving our objective. The best way to encourage people to properly manage their wastes will be to incentivize them monetarily for proper waste disposal and raise their awareness about the issue. This is the core of the solution Swachhcoin offers. Also, it is a scientifically proven fact that the amount of high-economic-value outputs that can be obtained from the accumulated wastes is tremendously reduced due to various types of waste being intermixed, thus degrading the unique property\/individuality of the same. Swachhcoin will implement waste segregation at source in SWBIN to eliminate this problem. The traditionally running waste management industries ¬†have poor infrastructure and the archaic technologies available to them greatly limits their operational abilities. Swachhcoin will eliminate this problem and take the technological abilities of the company to the state of the art level, thus increasing their profits significantly. The additional revenue obtained from deploying technologies such as AI, Big Data, IoT and Blockchain will increase their efficiencies and profitability, thus the additional capital invested in upgradation will be justified over a certain period of time. The cost of these additional investment will also be covered from ways that are currently absent in this sector such as revenue obtained from advertisement (on SWBIN). With the help of extensive research and development, a complete business plan, including break even point, will be made available by Swachhcoin to the adopting industries thus breaking the barrier of technology adoption.\n\n","answer":"Lots of Plastics Around 8 million metric tons of plastic ends up in the oceans every year which isequivalent to five grocery bags of plastic trash for every foot of coastline around the globe.

{"question":"I hear lots of people calling for a boycott on companies like Nestle or Apple, because those companies are often tied to child labor and inhumane working conditions in foreign countries. And obviously child labor and sweatshops are despicable, but I‚Äôve always wondered: if these boycotts became widespread enough to start affecting the company, would they actually start treating their employees better? Or would they just like, fire them all? Do boycotts help improve the conditions of mistreated workers, or do they just lead to them being unemployed and even poorer?\n\n(This is probably the dumbest and most ignorant question ever, but I don‚Äôt take AP Macro til next year and I kinda don‚Äôt know a lot about the global supply chain)","answer":"Far from being dumb or ignorant, it is indeed a very intelligent and legitimate question . Here is an excerpt from a paper that investigates this issue: \n\n\"A common perception is that most child laborers work for wages in the formal sector, conjuring images of children working long hours in sweatshops or toiling away in mines. As a result, consumer boycotts and trade sanctions against products using child labor as an input are often discussed as means of reducing the incidence of child labor. In reality, however, such methods may have little impact for several reasons. Firstly, nearly 70 percent of working children are active in the agricultural sector, rather than manufacturing (ILO, 2006). Secondly, very few children work for wages outside the home; rather, most children are employed by their parents on the family farm or enterprise (Edmonds and Pavcnik, 2005). As a result, the majority of child laborers will not be affected by boycotts and trading sanctions. Further, children working in the affected sectors may simply relocate to an unaffected sector. Similarly, an outright ban on child labor would in most cases be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce and as such would likely to have little effect on the overall incidence of child labor. In the worst case, a ban could end up making some children significantly worse off if these children are compelled to work in order to keep themselves and their families out of extreme poverty. This is not to say that bans are never motivated; clearly a ban on illegal and hazardous activities is desirable. However, additional policy instruments are necessary in order to effectively combat child labor.\"\n\n[https:\/\/gupea.ub.gu.se\/bitstream\/2077\/18369\/1\/gupea\\_2077\\_18369\\_1.pdf](https:\/\/gupea.ub.gu.se\/bitstream\/2077\/18369\/1\/gupea_2077_18369_1.pdf)"}

{"question":"This is driving me crazy just from confusion. In like 90% of books and sources I read, experts say rent control creates scarcity, it does the opposite of its desired effect essentially. I‚Äôve seen that when rent control was put into place in various cities it immediately lead to less housing development. I‚Äôve seen that it causes landlords to not care about upkeep, it causes abandoned buildings occasionally cause they weren‚Äôt profitable, and I read it can lead to construction of more luxury buildings where rent control doesn‚Äôt apply. In that last case it seems like this system that tries to help the poor in fact helps the rich. Yet I still see politicians advocating for it and it still exists in places around the world. What the hell am I missing? People don‚Äôt seem that upset over this and I don‚Äôt get it lol.","answer":"See my username.\n\nIt is bad for society, bad for new\/future residents, bad for a city as a whole.  That's basically the economic story, but I don't think you are asking why it is bad.\n\nSo why do we have it?\n\nBecause it is great for for current renters and current renters vote.  They outnumber landlords (many landlords probably don't even live in the same local political zone as their properties) and are easily moved by self-interest.  Nobody likes paying rent, so it is really easy to vote for a candidate who is going to keep yours down.\n\nWhy does it continue in places where it is having a clear adverse effect?\n\nSame reason basically.  The local tenants control who gets elected.  Any long time resident is heavily benefiting from rent control so they want to to stick around.  The people who are harmed most, such as those who can't find an apartment, don't live there and don't vote in the district.  \n\nSecond answer is just that a lot of people don't understand.  They see super high rents in non-rent controlled units and see it as evidence that rent control works.  Instead of blaming the rent controlled units for the problem, they get jealous and wish they had one themselves... They aren't going to vote against the thing they aspire to eventually have!\n\nBut mainly I think the story is that in most places with rent control, renters control the politicians who wrote the laws rebuilding rent.  They vote their own self interest and the politicians follow.\n\nedit: last night after posting this I listened to the rebroadcast [Freakonomics podcast about rent control](https:\/\/freakonomics.com\/podcast\/rent-control-rebroadcast\/).

{"question":"Just curious. I keep hearing things from 6 months to 10+ years. Just wanted to hear what people here thought.\n\nThis is with real money (no paper trading.)\n\nAlso any tips\/advice would be appreciated.","answer":"I've been trading since 1996'ish.  In that time I've traded just about every type of market condition there is.  Made a ton of money during the internet boom because all you had to do was trade a .com name and made a fortune.  I was on top of the world, king of the castle, the head honcho... then came the internet crash and I lost every damn penny chasing the dragon, and then some.  \n\nUnfortunately, I'm seeing a very similar mindset now as I did during the internet boom.  Everyone thinks they can make money and everyone is an expert.  Well, I'm not here to tell you not to chase your dreams and give it a shot, heck, I love the added volatility\/liquidity, just try not to do it with money you aren't prepared to lose (I'm speaking from firsthand experience here).\n\nTo answer your question, it took me about 7 years to become a decent profitable trader and about 15 years to become a damn good one. Don't get me wrong, I was profitable for most of those first 7 years (minus the internet bust blowup) but my personal volatility was off the charts.\n\nMy advice is to keep it simple.  Don't get caught up in trading all sorts of different vehicles, pick one, and learn it like the back of your hand.  Become the master of that one thing.  Then just grind it out.  All I trade is the \/YM now.  That's it, nothing else.  (I also manage my own investments but that's not trading).\n\nNext, don't trade just to trade, only trade when the setup is proper.  Patience is definitely the key here.  Don't rush into trades, don't trade just because you haven't done so in a while, don't force anything.  There have been weeks where I don't place a single trade.  \n\nFinally, learn when to sell losers.  It's more important (by a little) than knowing when to sell for a gain.  Cut your losses and you can live to play again tomorrow.\n\nGL"}

{"question":"My father has this newfound interest in the stock market and spent the last few weeks studying it. He told me he wanted to start trading and I told him to study it some more, or at the very least, start by paper trading.\n\na few days ago I found out he threw thousands of dollars on a stock that he did 0 research on, without telling me. His reasoning on picking that stock was that \"The graph went down so it must come up\".

He bought in at the 2-month high basically.\n\nHe currently has NO exit plan and I'm scared to tell him to cut his losses because there's a possibility of the share price jumping, and he'll end up blaming me for pushing him into selling.

{"question":"They say if you ask a poor person for money advice is poor and with rich it's rich. So I have been asking advice of people who have become financially independent, at least money isn't a stressing factor in their lives.\n\nOh my god. \"Save 20% of income and invest it.\" I explain money is tight and hardly any left to buy a single stock. \"Oh then ask for a raise or job hop.\" OK, my review is 6 months away, and in the Mean time what else? \"A side Hustle! Whatever you make there invest it!\" Tried and got burned out, actually made me work less from exhaustion. \n\nSo I asked \"what did YOU do?\" And the story is what you expext; my parents paid for college, I got into tech, my dad knew someone in the company, etc.\n\nThey are giving me advice they didn't follow through with. They could have just said \"I don't have any experience with that, I grew up in privilege.\"","answer":"At this point becoming financially independent requires a high salary, very low expenses, very good savings habits or a combination of two of the three. You‚Äôre asking people what they did to get there and saving AT LEAST 20% of their income, having side hustles, job hopping are all common things that actually work. When you are truly in poverty and are working lower wage jobs then  these things are just not possible so it‚Äôs hard to relate to that advice."}

{"question":"Wall Street has essentially no artificial restriction on the amount of people who can achieve the credentials required to enter the industry, unlike, say, medicine, which is restricted by the amount of medical school graduates, which is turn restricted by the number of medical schools.

To that end, why are investment banks and hedge funds able to maintain such high margins and salaries that aren‚Äôt present in other fields? \n\nOddly, in spite of there being orders of magnitudes more hedge funds now than in 1980, there is very little in the way of price competition. The 2 and 20 compensation model has remained the standard in spite of middling performance from most funds. How is the sector able to get away with this when other sectors are not?

The [FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Economics\/wiki\/faq_minwage\/) covers the topic well. Research has revealed that minimum wages don‚Äôt always lead to large employment losses, so most research today is focused on the question of at what level (or under what conditions) minimum wages could become more problematic.\n- In developmental economics, there is lots of cool research going on trying to answer the question of ‚Äúhow do we make very poor people better off?‚Äù I highly suggest ‚ÄúPoor Economics‚Äù by Banerjee &amp; Duflo (2019 Nobel laureates) as a non-technical read on the subject.

{"question":"According to Wikipedia, the United States has the seventh highest nominal GDP per capita in the world and the eighth highest PPP GDP per capita. And most of the countries ranked higher than it are very small and generate their money through oil (Norway, Qatar) or banking (Switzerland). Also according to Wikipedia, the US has the highest median household income. \n\nSo what explains this? Why is America so rich, even compared to other developed countries?","answer":"This question is too broad to provide a definitive answer to. \"Why are some countries richer than others?\" is *the* fundamental question in the field of macroeconomic growth and development. Getting a comprehensive answer would require taking a semester long course on growth and development (at the very least).\n\nWe know a little bit more about what are typically called \"proximate\" causes (for a general framework, see [here](http:\/\/klenow.com\/DevelopmentAccounting.pdf)). This answers the question of how the US makes more stuff than (say) France, in a literal physical sense. The short answer here is that generally speaking about 10-30 percent of the difference is explained by education and skill differences (\"human capital\"), 20 percent is explain by more and better machines (\"physical capital\"), and 50-70 percent is explained by \"total factor productivity\" (TFP), which is basically a term meaning \"everything else that is harder to measure\/quantify\".\n\nGiven its large role in explaining income differences, the last few decades of growth research has mostly involved trying to break down TFP and determine\/quantify its various components. I will defer to the previously linked paper if you want further discussion of this.\n\nBut this leaves open the question: why was it the US, in particular, that ended up with high human capital, physical capital, and TFP? Why not Argentina or some other country? These are effectively the first sets of arrows in the framework I linked.\n\nThis is a much broader and more open question without a conclusive answer. The answer seems be to lots of little things from history (WWII, colonialism, etc) to geography to culture to simple randomness. I'm unaware of the solid lit review covering all of this, and it's beyond the scope of this post. The gist is: there's a lot here that we don't really know and this bit in particular is still an active area of research.\n\nAnyways, that's my quick summary. There is also a cheap answer to your question that I have saved for the end (because apparently I wanted to write a post about development accounting). This is that the US simply works more hours than many of these countries which lets them make more income. If you look at [output per hour worked](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/labor-productivity-per-hour-pennworldtable?tab=table), the US is still near the top but it isn't a crazy outlier."}

{"question":"So I wrote an intermediate microeconomics exam in university back in like, 2009.  One of the questions on the exam was so absurd that I am about 25% sure it was actually a fever dream.\n\nThe gist was as follows:\n\nYou are sitting at a bar. You start chatting with the girl next to you, and really hit it off. Then suddenly, she has to leave. You were not able to get her name or number before she left. You want to see this person again. Using microeconomic theory, discuss how you can make this happen.\n\n\n\nI remember writing this huge paragraph about \"you need to go back to the same bar tomorrow at the same time\"\n\nBut goddammit reddit, it is 11 years later, I have a degree in economics, and I still don't know how I could have used economic theory to answer this.","answer":"Use [revealed preference](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Revealed_preference#The_Weak_Axiom_of_Revealed_Preference_(WARP). She has some utility function\n\nU(bar, x_1, x_2, x_3, ...)\n\nthat may be time-dependent as well. What matters is that she chose to attend that bar at that time, as opposed to other options.\n\nThe key is that we don't know how her constraints played into her decision to attend at the time. Hence, while going to the bar at the same time might be smart, you need to do more to ensure that deciding to go to the bar again is [individually rational](https:\/\/www.econlib.org\/book-chapters\/chapter-ch-4-individual-rationality-in-social-choice\/) for her. \n\nSo, you make a deal with the bar owner\/bartender to make a drink cheaper, or something that that reduces her cost of attendance. \"But it'll be very expensive if I have to strike a deal!\" Then you write out your intertemporal utility maximization problem, where your goal is to (potentially) marry this lady, but in the short run you'd have to pay the cost of the deal with the bartender (Note that the goal is probably to just meet this lady and get to know her more, with the possibility than you go on to want to marry her, but that depends on signals and whatnot; since it's an exam I think this can be mentioned in a line, while you just simplify the goal to marriage, due to limited time). I'd recommend writing search theory [Bellman equation(s)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dynamic_programming) for this portion, and characterizing the reservation cost of a deal you strike with the bartender using standard assumptions on utility\/production functions, i.e. the cost that makes you indifferent between a deal and no deal. See how you can apply the [Slutsky equation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slutsky_equation) to her decision-making process.\n\nThese parts can be answered in maybe 2\/3 a page of writing\/equations with normal-sized handwriting, which I think is reasonable for an exam question.\n\nIf you have time remaining, I'd definitely go into complements and substitutes. The day of the week matters here. My prior is that going to the bar on a Friday night is complementary to going to the bar next Friday night, but is a substitute for going to the bar on Saturday night. Going to the bar on, say, a Monday night is probably not a complement with anything, as the impression I have is that people unfortunately tend to do that when going through a rough time. But I don't drink, so I wouldn't know.\n\n*Note: this question is open-ended and most likely will accept multiple answers. It probably wants to test your economic reasoning.*\n\nEdit: I mixed up individual rationality with incentive compatibility at first."}

{"question":"So a few months back, my sister asked me to be her guarantor. I agreed. When I logged into the portal to sign the contract, I noticed she had also added me as the guarantor for one of her random ass friends she wanted to room with. After explaining to her how incredibly fucking stupid and unacceptable that was, I emphatically refused to sign her friend‚Äôs contract. Later, the apartments called me about the missing signature and I explained the situation and again refused to sign. \n\n\n\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, I get a bill in the mail from a debt collection agency. This is where I fucked up: I assumed I‚Äôd never hear from the other girl again, so I thought my sister was behind on her rent. She showed me proof that she wasn‚Äôt so I figured they had sent this earlier, but that my sister had since paid. \n\n\n\nTurns out the girl was being charged for a no show on her contract and they are treating me as the guarantor. Neither the debt collection agency nor the apartments can show me documentation proving that anything was signed by me. But the debt collectors want an email from the apartments to clear me from the account. The apartments swear up and down that I signed, but somehow can‚Äôt provide me with any proof.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the debt collector, it‚Äôs been over 30 days, so if they don‚Äôt get an email from the apartments within 48 hours, it‚Äôll affect my credit. I have zero expectation that the girl would pay it even if I could get in touch with her.\n\n\n\nWhat can I do? How can I put pressure on the apartments to send that email? ","answer":"You don't need to prove anything, send a debt validation letter to the collection agency requesting that they validate the debt before any further collection efforts.

My dad passed away on Friday, a few days after I started college for the first time. I was never close with him, and he and my mom got divorced when I was young. I was informed this morning that I will receive an inheritance as I am over the age of 18, and it is a significant amount, in the mid\/high 8 figures. My dad's lawyers say its tied up in equitys or something, and I'm not asking for advice about what to invest with it, I think it's being managed OK right now. My question is this: what do I do?! I was going to major in buisiness administration but now that doesn't seem like it makes sense, as I already kinda have made more than I ever would.

{"question":"\n\nIt is not a hidden fact that the global waste management problem ¬†we face cannot be tackled by a handful of people or organisations. The willingness and contribution of the mass is the key in successfully achieving our objective. The best way to encourage people to properly manage their wastes will be to incentivize them monetarily for proper waste disposal and raise their awareness about the issue. This is the core of the solution Swachhcoin offers. Also, it is a scientifically proven fact that the amount of high-economic-value outputs that can be obtained from the accumulated wastes is tremendously reduced due to various types of waste being intermixed, thus degrading the unique property\/individuality of the same. Swachhcoin will implement waste segregation at source in SWBIN to eliminate this problem. The traditionally running waste management industries ¬†have poor infrastructure and the archaic technologies available to them greatly limits their operational abilities. Swachhcoin will eliminate this problem and take the technological abilities of the company to the state of the art level, thus increasing their profits significantly. The additional revenue obtained from deploying technologies such as AI, Big Data, IoT and Blockchain will increase their efficiencies and profitability, thus the additional capital invested in upgradation will be justified over a certain period of time. The cost of these additional investment will also be covered from ways that are currently absent in this sector such as revenue obtained from advertisement (on SWBIN). With the help of extensive research and development, a complete business plan, including break even point, will be made available by Swachhcoin to the adopting industries thus breaking the barrier of technology adoption.\n\n","answer":"  Big  data  in  general  refers  to  collecting  and  storing  large  amount  of  data  in  order  to  extract  useful  information  which  enables  smart  and  effective  decision  making  in  real  time  and  future.

Upper-income families were the only income tier able to build on their wealth from 2001 to 2016, adding 33% at the median.

Does this mean that the saying is true?","answer":"The share of wealth of the top 1% and top 10% has been relatively stable over the last two centuries.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/319227140\/figure\/fig2\/AS:669671804117000@1536673608298\/Figure-no-1-Wealth-inequality-Europe-and-the-US-1810-2010.png\n\nAnd up until recently, the real wealth of the bottom 90% has grown quite steadily.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/static\/sys-images\/Guardian\/Pix\/pictures\/2014\/11\/11\/1415705163748\/7200feb5-69a6-43f2-a5ee-9f7251941be4-bestSizeAvailable.png?width=1920&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=57369e63eaa177bb49e9cab4c3391f68\n\nSo no, there is no general trend of the poor getting poorer.

{"question":"What do economists think of models of socialism where the means of production are owned by the workers, not the state, operating through a mixed market? Is such a thing even feasible?","answer":"The problem with this approach is that it creates a mismatch between supply of and and demand for capital. Different industries have wildly different capital to labor ratios, so you end up with situations where, e.g., landscapers own very little capital while factory workers own huge amounts of capital, despite these jobs having similar skill requirements.\n\nHow does that happen? It's not hard to buy landscaping tools, but how does a worker fresh out of high school get the cash to buy a share of a factory so he can work there?\n\nMaybe the factory worker doesn't have to buy in, but gets shares of the factory in addition to a salary. So he must get paid a lot less than the landscaper. But that's okay, since he has savings in the form of factory shares which I guess he'll sell to new workers when he retires. Unless the factory goes bust. Then he's kind of screwed. Investing your life's savings in one business isn't a great idea. Also, if the factory goes through a rough spell and loses money for several years, how do workers get paid?\n\nMeanwhile, the landscaper is living large on pure cash compensation. He's making so much money that he decides to save some and invest it in...what, exactly? There's no stock market because the means of production are all owned by the workers. Some market socialists allow the issuing of bonds, although it's never really been clear to me why buying a portion of future EBITDA via lending is kosher while doing so via equity is not. So there's an option, maybe.\n\nElsewhere, a group of young geniuses have a great idea and want to start a business. Let's say that after five years it has a 90% chance of failure and a 10% chance of making $10 billion. They need $5 million dollars to pay their business and living expenses for the next 5 years. They do not have this money. Lending is not a good way to fund this because of the high risk of failure. Equity investment would be ideal for this situation, but that's not allowed, because workers have to own the means of production. So they just go to work at existing companies.\n\nTo summarize, a non-exhaustive list of the problems:\n\n1. People who have cash to invest and people who need capital to do their jobs are often not the same people. This is an especially big problem for forming new firms, since bootstrapping is infeasible in industries that require large up-front investments.\n\n2. Workers who save money benefit from the ability to diversify their investments. Investing exclusively in the company where you work is a really bad idea.\n\n3. Often less-skilled workers simply are not productive enough that they can afford to take a large share of their total compensation in the form of shares.\n\nWe have capital markets in order to allocate capital efficiently and mitigate risk. When you don't allow the roles of worker and investor to be played by different people, that doesn't happen.\n\nFurthermore, workers who want to own the means of production can do that right now. All we have to do is set aside some of our pay to invest in the stock market. Preferably in an index fund instead of just one company."}

{"question":"I see people talk online about crypto. They talk about bitcoin, etherium etc. What I don't get is, these cryptos don't produce any stuff, require special tools to mine which is a costly process, thus creating a net negative sum game for cryptos like Bitcoin.\nThey also don't really have any function in society, they are not government approved for say, paying taxes, they are horrible for general transactions too.\nSo, it doesn't even benefit society in a meaningful way (in my opinion), so even for societies, Bitcoin is a net negative as it is sucking up capital to unproductive endeavour.\n\nThe only reason people talk about cryptos is because they are gaining in value which is happening because there's more demand for it than there's supply. And people are seeing that others have benefited and they are just following them. So my question is, isn't cryptos like Bitcoin just a glorified Ponzi scheme then?\n\nEven metals like gold have ornamental and industrial uses and other metals like Silver, Platinum have extensive industrial use.","answer":"I'm going to answer this from a legal perspective because there's a prevalent misconception of what a \"Ponzi scheme\" is.  The short answer is that what you're describing is not a \"Ponzi scheme.\"  In a Ponzi scheme, a person invests in a business and is paid at regular intervals with funds from subsequent investors.  A Ponzi scheme involves the investors being deceived as to the sources\/legitimacy of the funds used to pay them.\n\nCrypto currencies don't work that way. If you buy one bitcoin, that's it. You own a bitcoin that might go up or down in value, but you aren't being paid in cash with funds from subsequent investors.  The only way you get cash is by selling the bitcoin, and there's no deception or mystery about where that money is coming from. So crypto currencies are not a \"Ponzi scheme.\"\n\nThat's not to say crypto currencies are a good investment; beanie babies weren't a \"Ponzi scheme,\" but they also weren't a good investment.  It's also not to say that the \"investment advice\" people give about crypto currencies is legal. What you're referring to is something more like a [pump and dump scheme](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pump_and_dump), where people artificially inflate the value of an asset with misleading statements.  That's much harder to prove than a Ponzi scheme. It's pretty easy to prove someone is lying about the source of a business's revenue if there's no legitimate business activity going on. It's much harder to prove someone is knowingly lying when they say, \"I think the value of \\[madeup coin\\] will increase 10%.\""}

{"question":"Since billionares have so much money that is not being used to move the economy sunce its not being used at all, isn't this bad for the economy in a capitalist country?","answer":"Your question assumes that billionaires‚Äô wealth is mostly made up of cash. But it‚Äôs the opposite actually, they typically owns assets that are worth billions in the open market today.\n\nIn essence what that means is they bought\/invested in those assets with some cash at some point. And the recipients of that cash (typically some company), deployed that cash in a value creating manner for the public i.e. they provided goods and services that generate profits. The goods and services generate profits because the customers value them and are willing to spend money on it. In addition they generate profits because the company created the goods and services efficiently, in other words it costs them less to create than what customers are willing to pay. \n\nSo billionaires cash is actually being put to work in the market, and this is actually the essence of capitalism. Letting people choose where they want to spend their money, and in return giving them ownership of what they buy. In fact, this works the same whether you‚Äôre a billionaire or not. For most people with any retirement account, they don‚Äôt actually have much cash. They‚Äôve given their cash to someone else (usually another investor) who uses that cash however they want. This is all overly simplified but it‚Äôs meant to address your assumption and explain how the money is being used."}
{"question":"Hi, I am from India. I am totally new in Economics (have just started studying high school Economics).

Why would a superpower and rich country like USA need to borrow anything from a much poorer country like India? How does this work? Why is USA borrowing that money and what for?","answer":"Nations borrow by issuing bonds. They sells bonds at auctions. The bond then pays a payment over some number of years, that's called the coupon. At the end the principle is paid back.\n\nSo, you could buy a bond with a face value of $100. It might pay, say, $2 every year. Then after 10 years, for example, the government will pay the entire $100 back. This bond is auction off to the highest bidder and then can be traded on the bond market.\n\nAs a result, all sorts of people and organizations own bonds. Nearly anyone who wants to can buy bonds. Though some countries have laws limiting buying bonds from other countries they consider hostile.\n\nMany governments buy the bonds of other governments. That is all about controlling forex rates. Government like to have the ability to prevent steep declines in forex rates. To prevent that they intervene in the forex market and buy their own currency paying with another currency. Very often that other currency is the US dollar. Rather than holding dollars countries often hold bonds which can easily be sold in exchange for dollars.\n\nImagine that there's an emergency of some sort in India and the value of the rupee falls. The government needs to import some goods to deal with the emergency. They hold US bonds which they can sell for dollars then they can buy the goods for import with those dollars."}
{"question":"This is not a call against conservative views.

{"question":"This is like an OT, but interesting to know in my opinion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n In the Italian pension system, pensions are paid thanks to those who work today and pay contributions. Whoever pays contributions today gets the future right to get a pension in turn. But if there aren't enough workers in the future, there won't be enough money to pay off these 'debts'. This creates a financial imbalance. \n\n At present, the incomes are lower than the outgoings and a hole is created that must be filled by the state. Thus we speak of a **social security deficit**. \n\n The only way to repair the deficit would be to raise the retirement age (already very high on average), raise taxes and (sadly) hope that retired people live shortly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy this is a Ponzi scheme? \n\n*  absence of product and promise of earnings (INPS promises us the pension but does not guarantee it)\n*  new ones paying old \n*  only one promoter or company \n*  unclear information \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Certainly at the moment the INPS for structure, for functioning cannot last over time.

{"question":"Hello!\n\nA few years back, my Economics professor made a statement that has stuck out to me for a while. He said something along the lines of \"I don't worry about environmental issues\/tree shortages because the free market will adjust prices and price it out of consumption.\" In other words, when the environment is in trouble, you will see prices adjust, such as the price of paper increasing.\n\nHowever, that has always struck me as odd. It seems to me that (1) the market is profit driven not environmentally driven, so prices will not react to environmental needs and (2) that the market is more reactive than proactive. Meaning that once we see the market hypothetically adjusts to environmental issues, it will be too late.\n\nSo, my question sums up to this: how does the \"invisible hand\" work and can the free market\/invisible hand fix issues such as environmental issues with price adjustments as my professor described?\n\nHope this makes sense!\n\nEDIT: Wow, thank you everyone for your thoughtful responses - I really didn't expect it! This has been some really fun reading and I've learned a lot. I did neglect to say this in the original post, but my professor did not make this argument in class as a simplified example. He noted it as an off the cuff (but somewhat passionate) response to a student asking why he used so much paper - which is why it has stuck with me for so long! \n\nAnyway, thanks for all the responses! ","answer":"You are correct. What your professor seem to not realize is that some markets have market failures. With enviromental issues, the most clear one are externalities. Some reasurces are hard to incorporate into the game because of their nature.\n\nThat is why we created some measures to be able to incorportate those costs into the market and then let the market do its job, like carbon trading markets and fisher permits, for example. I recomend you to check \"externalities\" and \"tragedy of the commons\" to get clear examples.\n\nIt is a bit strange from an economics professor given that this is basic micro, and there are fields totally dedicated to these issues like enviromental economics."}

You are not to this point yet, but it is coming and maybe this will give you some pointers based on my personal situation. Below is my current situation....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nI had a similar situation with my father. He came to me one day and told me he had been getting money from people at his church to avoid being homeless, but they weren't giving him any more because he wasn't taking any steps to rectify his issues. He needed to borrow some money to pay his rent and I didnt want to give him money because I knew he would need it every month. His only retirement income is social security. Below is how I tackled the problem...\n\nI told him I would help him, but only if he tuned his finances over to me 100%. He gets about 1300 per month social security. He had no choice but to agree. He had several payday type loans, credit card debt and had gotten a new loan against his paid off car. He basically used every form of credit he had access to and maxed everything out.\n\n1. I opened a checking account in my name only at his bank\n2. I opened a savings account in both of our names at his bank\n3. We called the social security office and changed his check to be deposited into the savings account (he cant write checks against a savings account)\n4. When his check is deposited I transfer it to my checking account\n5. I transfer 60 bucks every Monday into the savings account for him to withdraw. This is for food, fuel and every expense he has\n6. I pay all of his bills from my checking account ( which only has his money in it)\n7. I called the payday loan places and told them I hired an attorney ( I didn't), called the better business bureau and the consumer protection agency. I told them the lawyer I hired actually offered to handle this for free because his father went through the same thing and he was eager to make them pay again. All of them dropped all of his debt and wiped the slate clean. Bluff worked. In my state it is illegal for them to take post dated checks and they still do it because nobody knows any better. I had the law on my side so that helped with the bluff. The loan companies knew they would not stand a chance in court.\n8. I met with the bank manager and explained what I was doing so that she could help me watch his accounts and understand the weird movement of money.\n9. I closed his checking account so that no more checks could bounce against it\n10. He moved into a controlled rent home where his rent is determined by his income\n11. He lived on 40 bucks a week until I got his payments under control. Now he gets 60 and he has 5 grand saved up that he doesn't know about. When he has an emergency, like dental needs or doctor or new tires, I use the money from his account. He thinks I pay for it out of my pocket. On this system he saves around 100 bucks per month but thinks he breaks even.\n\nI can't tell him he has a nest egg because he absolutely sucks with money and is like a child with it. He would find a reason to need it within days and would blow it at the bar where he drinks with his VA friends. I told him if I caught him hiding money from me, or lying to me to get money, or being deceiving in any way I would close the checking account, take my name off the saving account and would not help him anymore. He is an adult and is responsible for himself.\n\nI never had much of a relationship with him but feel that being the first born son is a big deal. I feel, as the first born son, I am responsible and my duties are not noble or charitable but a requirement for a family unit to maintain its integrity.\n\nI hope this is helpful for you, but either way I wish you luck and even though I don't know your name you will be in my prayers. Life is hard, but it is even harder when your parents can't hold up their end of the deal. Whatever you do, do not strip them of their dignity, do not publicly shame them or give them reason to feel ashamed. They made a life error that they won't recover from, but they were blessed enough to have children that love them. They are fortunate. What you are going through now and how you are handling it will be one of the reasons you will be able to lay your head on your pillow at night and sleep soundly later in life. We do what is right not because it is easy, but because we go through enough shit in life to not have to be haunted by the wrongs of our youth."}

But I'm just wondering: is this mainly a sub for the more wealthy?","answer":"36k earner here from Austria! That translates to 1.8k netto monthly. It has been my salary for about 2 years now. Previously my salary was 26k\/1.4k netto (PhD student) for about 3 years after which I was unemployed for 1¬Ω years. My salary during that time was about 20k\/1.1k netto.

Despite the fact that I am making more than I used to, this habit has stuck. In my head, my salary is still just 1.4k. If I could make do on that salary for 3 years, I can jolly well do it now. As soon as the paycheck comes in, I lock 300 to 500 away and then figure out how to deal with the rest. \n\nThis sub has definitely been helpful for me and a few friends of mine. We are all in the 20k to 40k range. Based on what we've learned here, we've all started off a Sparplan and are putting away anywhere between ‚Ç¨50 and ‚Ç¨300 a month on the regular.

{"question":"\n\nThe key takeaway for current and future issuers is to differentiate themselves and find a way to attain the aforementioned network effect.\n\nTo accomplish this, such issuers will need to rely on optimized technology, service providers, algorithms and network endpoints to make transactions cheaper and faster, with less friction. At the end of the day, the utility of a stablecoin is its ease of use ‚Äì either through payment, speculative purposes or remittances.\n\nWhereas Visa, Mastercard and American Express have huge networks to offer their customers, stablecoins will find a uniform way to transact across borders and technologies, all the while maintaining a fast and secure architecture, the impact of which will produce greatly amplified ramifications for digital assets globally.\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, there will also be ways to remit stablecoins nearly instantaneously with low settlement risk and on a real-time gross settlement basis. In order to get there, and since most centralized fiat-backed stablecoins typically rely on one issuer, one bank account, one auditor, and are tied to one jurisdiction‚Äôs laws, we need a better defined global legal and tax framework to govern such borderless assets.\n\nWhile these are typically handled between G20 member organizations and at the OECD level, blockchain technology itself may become a solution.

{"question":"From what I've read house prices being high and rapidly increasing is a good sign they may crash. I've read this in property investment guides and online about timing the cycle. Everywhere I look seems to assume that property prices will continue to rise well into the 2040s!\n\nNow I've read the average baby boomer will die in 2034, which will create a buyers market but no analysts from property firms or banks seem to agree. My sneaking suspicion is that they are wealthy and benefit from increasing house prices and wouldn't want anyone to know the party has to end eventually.","answer":"The first point is that it's spectacularly hard to time bubbles. I haven't heard anyone say that prices will rise monotonically, and I would be skeptical of anyone who says they can predict year over year changes for the next twenty years. I certainly can't. There are also semantic questions of what exactly a \"crash\" is (are dropping prices a crash? is it determined by foreclosures?).\n\nStill, limiting ourselves to the near term (maybe the next five years), we can look at various reasons for why home prices are going up and ask ourselves if we think that these reasons could be signs of an impending crash. \n\nOn the demand side, one of the largest reasons for why some many people want homes now is that interest rates are at historic lows. It is considerably [cheaper to get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage than it ever has been](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/MORTGAGE30US). This will push up the price of homes because it means that more people are able to afford them. Importantly, [foreclosures are also at record lows](https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/mortgages\/foreclosures-fell-to-record-low-in-2020\/) (with the very important caveat that while they are especially low currently because the [Federal Government has issued a freeze on foreclosures for homes with federally backed mortgages](https:\/\/www.hud.gov\/press\/press_releases_media_advisories\/HUD_No_21_009)). There will likely be an uptick on foreclosures when the moratorium lifts, as the COVID-19 pandemic has meant that [more homeowners are behind on their mortgage payments](https:\/\/www.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publication\/103273\/housing-finance-at-a-glance-a-monthly-chartbook-november-2020_0.pdf) (pg 24). However, compared to the Great Recession, which saw historic levels of foreclosures on the backs of predatory loans, the low interest rates do not seem to be inviting people to take out loans they truly cannot afford. \n\nOn the supply side, the number of homes we are building has not kept pace with the increased demand for homes. The stock of available housing, which peaked in 2011 [has hit a historic low](https:\/\/www.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publication\/103273\/housing-finance-at-a-glance-a-monthly-chartbook-november-2020_0.pdf) (pg 20). This has been [exacerbated by the pandemic](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/us-underbuilding-housing-over-the-past-decade-2020-9), which caused many construction firms to cease production during the otherwise peak summer months.  [Housing construction has been trending up in the last decade](https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/united-states\/housing-starts); it just hasn't kept pace with demand. \n\nIt's possible that these trends will reverse. Interest rates could go up and the relative housing supply could increase. Both of these would push down prices. Still, something like the Great Recession where a substantial number of homeowners are unable to make their payments seems unlikely. The rise in foreclosures was driven by predatory loans where repayment relied on the promise of refinancing based on increased equity. I don't see evidence that this is happening. Maybe housing prices will fall (or at least stop increasing faster than inflation) in the next 10 years -- I don't know -- but I would not predict the housing market to collapse in the next few years."}

{"question":"I have been reading the book: The oil factor by Stephen Leeb written in 2004. He talks about the inverse relation between (rapid) increase in oil prices, lowering supply and high demand, but he takes a detour. The dotcom bubble dropped sp500 -40%, nasdaq -80%, 16trillion USD wealth went to 7 trillion. The fed lowered rates to 0.75%, boosted borrowing and home prices served as a healthy collateral, which can only go up right? US was highly in debt before the bust, but after‚Ä¶ oh with low rates causing booms in home prices, more debt. In this 2004 books he says, if home prices would fall it would be taking down the banking system (1:6 leverage at that time so 18% default was needed to make the banks insolvent, we know later the leverage was 1:20 so 5% default was enough). What would cause home prices to fall? Policies to curb inflation, aaaand when did the fed start to raise rates? Yes, early 2007.

The stock market consists disproportionately of medium and large companies.

The Suez channel blocking is bad for supply chains, but the relative ability of different companies to supply is hurt almost equally. On top of this, the Suez channel situation is temporary and will be over in two weeks at most (if the ships rerout around South Africa). \nThe value of a stock depends on the perceived ability of a company to be profitable long term.\nCovid hurt small businesses disproportionately, and the end is in sight.

{"question":"There's this [article](https:\/\/monthlyreview.org\/2009\/05\/01\/why-socialism\/) by Einstein blatantly endorsing socialism.  \nI'd like to clarify that I have no dog in this fight, and I think Einstein being Einstein deserves the benefit of the doubt.  \nNow I read the article. It has some interesting points. Though it seems very idealistic in some cases.  \nMost discussions I've encountered about this article online and on reddit talk about whether Einstein's qualified to talk about this along with the typical socialism\/capitalism circlejerks.  \nNone are actually addressing the points being made in the article.  \nSo I'm curious to hear what economists have to say about the things written there.","answer":"You should keep in mind that Einstein, while an excellent physicist, is about as educated in economics as your average Joe, and not instantly credible in the field of economics because he's good at physics. Same goes for an economist regarding physics. If an economist wrote a paper on general relativity with a bit more than average research (that probably isn't correct to begin with), would you take him seriously? Probably not. \n\nIn the article, he seems to be essentially saying that economics is not a real science by comparing it to astronomy, which isn't a very good argument. The field of economics does have a set methodology they use to conduct research. See Econ methodology FAQ in the sidebar of this sub.\n\nHe then appears to make the ethical argument for socialism, which, while completely ok, is outside the scope of economics.\n\nOverall this article isn't much different from any other. It ignores basic economic concepts and instead makes an ethical case, which an economist can't really respond to."}
{"question":"I have a full time non-investment job like a lot of you.

I started religiously filtering stocks on Screener eventually. Carefully reading through annual reports and quarterly results. It was actually pretty exciting. Researched the background and experience of the leadership of the companies I was interested in as well.\n\nAfter 2-3 months of solid studying, I eventually bought a few stocks and started tracking news about them regularly. I also followed discussions about these companies in forums and twitter so see if I had missed some important info.\n\nAfter further 2-3 months of doing this, I eventually got busy in some office project and just couldn't give much time to this. Weeks went by when I didn't open Screener to see BSE filings simply because I was tired after work.\n\nEventually I just lost track of what was going on with the companies. I opened Screener eventually and there was such a backlog of reading material that it was just too much for me to go through. \n\nThe point is, apart from some lucky time spells, it just takes too much time and energy to track your stocks and see results, filings, news etc. Even if you just track 15 stocks, you will have a LOT of data to go through on a regular basis. It's not sustainable for most of us unless this is your full time job as well.\n\nI recently sold all my stocks in Zerodha(I was up 45% btw) and put that money in Nifty 50 index fund and have never felt more relaxed with my investment choice.

{"question":"I'd really like to have a discussion here about GME. Everytime it seems I see anyone suggest it as a viable investment, it gets downvoted to oblivion. I hear some of the same arguments against its volatility but exposure to volatility is ok in a balanced portfolio, you dont need to be strictly ETF's. Know your limit, play within it, when it comes to speculative investments. \n\nAnother argument is that its a dead business, that is far from the fact imo. It was on a downward path and would have gone the way of blockbuster but at this point, I see it as more of a Netflix. It is a debt free company, great new management team, proven to care about investors and care about the quality of service that customers receive. \n\nThe fact it's been labelled a \"meme\" stock is insulting at this point, it's not a \"meme\" company with a bunch of \"meme\" employees. It's a company transitioning from its antiquated business model into a hopefully ecommerce powerhouse with at this point a global brand. The craze around this stock has made GME more of a household name then it has ever been. \n\nI'd love to have a good constructive discussion about it and see what exactly it is that makes some people so bearish on this and maybe we can take it a little more seriously then the label it's been given by CNBC and other MSM.","answer":"IMHO there is no reason why we can‚Äôt discuss it...\nI perfectly understand why people don‚Äôt like it (fundamentals\/ maybe old outdated model)... but I also understand why they do (Hedgefunds have been caught with their hands in the cookie jar, and are in an almost indefensible position, and the fact that there is hope for the future in the form of a new Leadership and direction.)\nIf you look at a number of tech stocks (including darlings such as Tesla), they also have stupid valuations...\nSo yeah... we should be able to discuss it..."}
{"question":"In light of all of the \"should I sell posts\" I have to speak up a bit.  \n\n2 weeks ago you look at any rate my portfolio post and nearly everyone is recommending every high-risk ETF you could name.  ARKK, ARKG, ARKW, ARKQ, ICLN, YOLO, MOON, TAN, LIT, I can keep going.  And these were all recommended knowing damn well that a correction was due.  And nearly unanimously every person would say something along the lines of \"Buy and don't sell\", \"Cathie Wood could sell me on immortality at this point\", \"There'll be a correction I'm sure, but don't sell.\"\n\nNow the second a \"correction appears to happen\" you all panic.  The market will bounce back, bottom line.   It's like people forgot about the horrible drop when the pandemic happened.  Now looking back, everyone wishes they bought more stock around then.\n\nGo ahead and sell, it not my portfolio and I don't lose sleep over your decisions.  But let me double-check how far this correction has been so far.  \n\nYep.. checking ... the S&amp;P is down to where we were all the way back to... exactly one month ago.  Yep.\n\nThe NASDAQ100 is down to ... 3 months ago.  Incredible.  \n\nARKK is down slightly where it was in January 1... 2 months ago.\n\nBut disregard all of that.  Maybe the moral of the story is that Reddit shouldn't be defining your portfolio because no one knows what they're doing.  The swarm of ARK followers has sort of disappeared.  I haven't seen a single renewable energies ETF post that sounds like they're keeping it.  Don't just \"hear what's good\" and then buy it and then the second \"you hear what's bad\", sell it.\n\nJack Bogle said it best.

If I think it's got some room to run, but am ok selling at \"x\" price, I'll buy the 100 shares and sell a covered call. I don't do this with stocks I'm aiming to hold for long term.

{"question":"I spent my career at FAANG (I'm FIRE now) in the Seattle area. I viewed my position as a winning lottery ticket. Anyone at a higher leadership level at a FAANG makes such an insane salary (by a comparison to any normal income) that FI is clearly possible. Since every one of my peers should have made $300k annually or often much more, you would expect that they're all working because they love the work, not because they still need the money.\n\nEven with these high salaries, the majority of my co-workers spent a significant percentage of their income. They would talk about anxiously waiting for a stock vesting to pay off some bills. They'd talk about how their car payment (on their Tesla, or fancy BMW) was almost done, which was a relief because it was hard to make ends meet.\n\nI remember talking to someone who was certainly making 7 figures a year, and had been for years. They said they needed probably another 10+ years to be able to retire, if they could cut down on their expenses. With complete seriousness they said that their third vacation home was probably too expensive, and they needed to really figure out a family budget.\n\nIn the end, if you make a \"decent\" income, it is 100% about lifestyle creep. It's not necessarily about living like a college student (e.g. leanfire). Lifestyle creep's impact surprises people. It's not always about a third vacation home. Sometimes it's about the slightly more expensive car, and the slightly more expensive vacation, and the slightly nicer clothes. Next thing you know, you've received lovely 5% a year raises, with 6% a year expense increases. That's digging a hole, not improving your situation.\n\nAnyway, my main point is that income is necessary up to a certain point to be able to achieve FIRE, but the majority of people above that line shoot themselves in the foot all on their own :)","answer":"There was a post I think on twitter or something a while back about how a family making $200k a year could be\/feel poor or be living paycheck to paycheck, presumably to draw up sympathy.

{"question":"Note: I apologize if the following hurts the sentiments of western people, who I understand forms the majority of this sub.\n\nI am from India and here, people from both sides of the political spectrum say that western countries have only become rich with high GDP per capita and amazing infrastructure thanks to us third world countries. I am not an Economist so they told me that essentially western countries use the fact that we people from third world countries would do anything for very less money and therefore they earn a lot of profit from us. Most of the 'dirty' work like manufacturing is done in China because if western countries would have had to do it all by themselves the prices of products would skyrocket. That is why, they say, major MNCs come to our countries so that they can exploit us by making us do their jobs for less money and much less labour laws (so more exploitation I guess.) One of the common sentiments is that UK is now rich only because of how they historically exploited Indians (and other colonies as well) and the entire Europe and America is rich in modern times because they distributed this profit among themselves.\n\nAre the above true? Also, is it essential for first world countries to keep exploiting third world countries in order to 'stay' rich?","answer":"Nope. \n\nFor example, back in 1970, when the USA was already one of the richest countries on the planet by GDP per capita, US imports were only [5.2% of US GDP](https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS?end=2019&amp;locations=US&amp;start=1970&amp;view=chart). \n\nAs for the UK, trade wasn't that important at the start of the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, Clark, O'Rourke and Taylor published a paper estimating that the¬†the welfare impact of cutting off all¬†trade, including not just colonies but also with countries like France (which you can literally see from places on the eastern coast of the UK)¬†would be only 3-4% of national income, rising to 25-30% in the 1850s. (Note that this excludes the benefit of¬†trade¬†in ideas and new species such as potatoes.) \n\nSecondly, as observed by Adam Smith, back in *The Wealth of Nations*, it is better to have richer¬†trading¬†partners than poorer, but colonisation was inherently a destructive process. Smith distinguished carefully between the benefits of the discovery of the Americas and the harms of European colonisation, noting that many of the gains of the actual coloniers came at the expense not just of their victims but also higher prices and lower supply of colonial products in the 'home' countries.¬†\n\nConsistent with this, the evidence is that, through the 19th century and up until the 1990s, rich countries traded more with other rich countries. \nSee for example https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/exports-from-western-europe-to-other-regions?country=~Western+Europe\n\nOr https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/merchandise-exports-by-continent?country=~USA\n\nAnd much of the rise in trade between the West and poor countries in recent decades is driven by the rise in trade with China, where Chinese incomes have grown rapidly. \n\nThis admittedly is talking about direct trade in goods and services, places like India and China have made major contributions to the international pool of scientific, technological and mathematical knowledge. \n\n**Source**\n\nClark, O'Rourke and Taylor, 2014, *The growing dependence of Britain on¬†trade¬†during the industrial revolution*, Scandinavian Economic History Review (working paper publicly accessible at¬†~~https:\/\/www.economics.ox.ac.uk\/materials\/papers\/13258\/clark-et-al-new-world.pdf~~ NEW LINK: \nhttps:\/\/pseudoerasmus.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/clark-orourke-taylor-the-growing-dependence-of-britain-on-trade-during-the-industrial-revolution.pdf)."}

{"question":"\n\nIt is not a hidden fact that the global waste management problem ¬†we face cannot be tackled by a handful of people or organisations. The willingness and contribution of the mass is the key in successfully achieving our objective. The best way to encourage people to properly manage their wastes will be to incentivize them monetarily for proper waste disposal and raise their awareness about the issue. This is the core of the solution Swachhcoin offers. Also, it is a scientifically proven fact that the amount of high-economic-value outputs that can be obtained from the accumulated wastes is tremendously reduced due to various types of waste being intermixed, thus degrading the unique property\/individuality of the same. Swachhcoin will implement waste segregation at source in SWBIN to eliminate this problem. The traditionally running waste management industries ¬†have poor infrastructure and the archaic technologies available to them greatly limits their operational abilities. Swachhcoin will eliminate this problem and take the technological abilities of the company to the state of the art level, thus increasing their profits significantly. The additional revenue obtained from deploying technologies such as AI, Big Data, IoT and Blockchain will increase their efficiencies and profitability, thus the additional capital invested in upgradation will be justified over a certain period of time. The cost of these additional investment will also be covered from ways that are currently absent in this sector such as revenue obtained from advertisement (on SWBIN). With the help of extensive research and development, a complete business plan, including break even point, will be made available by Swachhcoin to the adopting industries thus breaking the barrier of technology adoption.\n\n","answer":" Swachhcoin will be collecting waste through its specially created SWBins, which are specialized waste disposal units that will be placed on various locations for easy accessibility to its users.

{"question":"We all know that billionaires don't have billions of dollars laying around in banks, but instead they have billions of dollars worth of assets. So an argument on Reddit that I see quite frequently is that billionaires avoid paying taxes, even when they need money, by simply borrowing against their assets. \n\nThe issue is that to pay off these loans, they would either need to earn dividends (which are taxed) or to sell assets (again, taxed) to pay off these loans. \n\nOften, the response is that the billionaires simply don't pay off the debt and die with it, or they roll the debt into new debt. Here's an article depicting this argument if I'm not being clear enough: https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/american-billionaires-tax-avoidance-income-wealth-borrow-money-propublica-2021-6\n\nI've looked around online trying to find out how exactly this works and all I can find are articles like the one provided. \n\nSo TLDR: my question is how does borrowing against assets actually avoid paying tax? Surely it has to be paid back eventually. Why would banks lend hundreds of millions to billionaires knowing they'll just defer payment until they die? What advantage does the bank gain by doing that? Or are there any other mechanisms at work?","answer":"\"Buy, Borrow, Die\" seems to be the term popularized to describe the strategy you are referencing. The basic idea is to exploit the step-up in basis that occurs upon death. The steps are (broadly)\n\n1) Buy: (or create by starting a successful business) an asset and have it appreciate.  Say you spend $10 on a stock and it is now worth $20. You have $10 in capital gains.\n\n2) Borrow: instead of selling $10 of stock and paying capital gains tax on $10, pledge $10 of stock as collateral for a loan of $10 that you can go spend as you see fit.\n\n3) Die: keep holding the stock and the loan until you die. Your heir can sell the stock for $20 with no capital gains due to step-up basis rules, pay off your $10 loan, and have $10 leftover in cash (the original value of the stock.\n\nYou have spent $10 on a stock, used $10 of the gains to buy stuff with, and passed the original $10 to your descendant. Congratulations! You successfully avoided paying capital gains on the $10 of appreciation on your stock.\n\nIn this case, the bank is willing to lend because 1) the loan is fully collateralized and low-risk and 2) they can charge a small annual interest rate and make money. The borrower is willing to borrow because (assuming they are old enough), paying a small annual interest rate is dramatically cheap than paying capital gains tax.\n\nYou can google around with the phrase. I've yet to find any actual evidence that the rich use this particular loophole or any tax lawyers recommending it. Not saying that they don't, just that it only became well-known after the ProPublica piece referenced in the link you posted was published and so far speculation about the extent of its use is just that, speculation.\n\nEDIT: Since a lot of people are asking, remember that the estate tax is (broadly speaking) levied on *net* assets.  Passing the $20 of stock and $10 of loan to your heir is taxed the same as passing $10 to your heir, and so the capital gains that were \"borrowed\" don't get hit by the estate tax either."}
{"question":"From what I've read house prices being high and rapidly increasing is a good sign they may crash. I've read this in property investment guides and online about timing the cycle. Everywhere I look seems to assume that property prices will continue to rise well into the 2040s!\n\nNow I've read the average baby boomer will die in 2034, which will create a buyers market but no analysts from property firms or banks seem to agree.

If you look back you can find someone claiming a crash every year. Eventually someone is right, but even then it‚Äôs often times regional.  Now dipping further you need to look at inflation.

{"question":"I was reading Yuval Noah Harari's book *Sapiens*, and on page 136, he says, \"...it's a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.\"  There is no specific citation for this in the book, and it caught my eye because I had read that Thomas J. Stanley's book, *The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy,* said that [only 20% of millionaires inherited their riches.](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/financial-edge\/0810\/7-millionaire-myths.aspx)\n\nI'm guessing that perhaps Harari is going off the Georgetown study that said [to succeed in America, it‚Äôs better to be born rich than smart](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/05\/29\/study-to-succeed-in-america-its-better-to-be-born-rich-than-smart.html) or talented?\n\nWould you say Harari's quote is true?

E.g., children of rich families might go to better schools, get better medical care, better support outside of schools, have wealthier and more influential people in their social networks, and have a better financial safety net if they want to do something risky, like starting a new business or running for political office.

{"question":"This is one of those questions that ive always been afraid to ask because I feel stupid for not knowing \/ understanding the answer, but it came up in my mind as I was listening to a lecture from Mankiw. \n\nIn that lecture, he said that expanding education would decrease inequality because most of the US' inequality increase from the 70s onward was due to Skill-Biased Technological Change, since technology significantly benefited those with high skills, while those with low skills were more or less left out.\n\nThis makes sense, and I can definitely see why giving low-skilled workers more skills would decrease inequality (as it could help them capture the gains of technology)\n\nbut dont we need low-skilled workers, like in services, for instance? Dont we need taco bell workers, janitors, etc.? If everyone had a college degree or more, who would be \/ who would wanna work in these jobs?","answer":"No (and yes).\r  \nFirst thing is that the price of any good or service in any given market is determined by the supply and demand of that specific service. Labor market, like it or not, is not different. So education and salaries, even if they are correlated since there are factors moderating their relation (like specialization) do not have a causal relationship.\n\n\r  \nSecond, there is a gap between giving somebody high education, and having that person working in jobs related to his high education experience. You may be a mechanical engineer and end up working as a bartender. This is happening in many economies around the globe.\r\n\nWhen you consider a closed environment (let's say that we lock everybody up in X country and nobody can enter or leave) if you give high education to 100% of the population, the only thing that is going to happen, is that these skills will decrease in value as there will be an oversupply, and probably, lack of enough demand. On the other hand, low skilled jobs will be in high demand, so the salaries of the first will go down, and the salaries of low skilled jobs will go up, and eventually, you will have people that are engineers and rather work in a low skilled job. So, no, education does not cause that shortage by itself.\n\n\r  \nBut, and here comes the trick, we don't live in closed environments. If high skilled employees are not paid enough, before going to work to low skilled manual jobs, many will leave the country, and you will have a brain drain."}

{"question":"The anthropologist David Graeber's book \"Bullshit Jobs\" describes how out of all of our jobs, an enormous amount are pointless, non-productive jobs that contribute little or nothing to society or even the firm.  A lot of his information seems to be gathered from surveys and talking to people about their jobs, what they do on a daily basis, and their opinion about how important their job is.  Such jobs exist in the public sector, although, from what I have gleaned (I have not read the book), Graeber seems to stress that these jobs are located (primarily?) in the private-sector, particularly in the corporate world.  His typology of bullshit jobs via Wikipedia:\n\n1. flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important, e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants\n2. *goons*, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public relations specialists\n3. *duct tapers*, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed permanently, e.g., programmers repairing shoddy code, airline desk staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive\n4. *box tickers*, who create the appearance that something useful is being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers\n5. *taskmasters*, who manage‚Äîor create extra work for‚Äîthose who do not need it, e.g., middle management, leadership professionals\n\nSo, my question is: what can we do (through policy?) to eliminate the tendency to have an abundance of bullshit jobs?","answer":"&gt;A lot of his information seems to be gathered from surveys and talking to people about their jobs, what they do on a daily basis, and their opinion about how important their job is.\n\nTo put this into context, his data consists of things like survey of the readers of strike magazine, which has [very clear political leanings](https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/strikemagyo\/) as well as literal dinner table conversations. Reliable empirical work is scarce to nonexistent.\n\nThe problems with that should be obvious. But to be a bit more precise, how people feel about and judge their job does not just depend on the nature of their work, but also things like societal perception, management performance, your age, or if you like your boss and coworkers.\n\nNot to mention that picking representative samples should be absolutely paramount to good research, and getting your samples from a group with obvious biases is the opposite of that.\n\nI also shouldn't have to mention that if your work is societally useful or not does not depend on whether you like Susan sitting at the desk next to you or not.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/329366731_Socially_Useless_Jobs\n\nAnd his work does not hold up to direct scrutiny, either. He makes an entirely unwarranted jump from the subjective perceptions on the usefulness of work to objective societal usefulness. The testable hypotheses one can derive from that mostly fall apart once tested.\n\nhttps:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/09500170211015067\n\nAlso, really, just sit down and read his examples and think about them for a bit. It's a list of jobs Graeber doesn't like.\n\nHe cites actuaries as one example. That's the guy who tells you how expensive your car insurance is. Is that \"useless\" work? Maybe in a perfect world where nobody ever gets into an accident. In our world, risks happen and risk management is incredibly useful.\n\nHe cites bailiffs as another one. That's the guy who makes sure criminals can't just get up and run away in court.\n\nHe also cites programmers as one. Because bugs \"shouldn't happen\". Bugs are basically bound to happen once a program gets sufficiently complex, which in reality is a few dozen to a few hundred lines of code. You can't possibly cover every case, not to even mention that something like different hardware can lead to new bugs that make it impossible to fix everything preemptively without infinite time and a time machine.\n\nAll in all, of course bullshit jobs exist, but Graebers work in particular is scientifically unsound and it's unlikely the scale of the problem is nearly as big as described by him."}

In our website, one can find all of our social channels to stay tuned with on-going CyClean processes. We treat following social channels.

Within our allowed budget, we are sending agents to go spread the message to citizens of various countries. Although offline marketing may reach smaller crowd than online crowd at the moment itself, it has powerful influence over people and over industry opinions because a real person, most of the time founder or core director, visits the place with real presence so the outcome is quite as powerful as the online marketing.

The money supply isn't part of that at all.\n\n&gt;but surely if there was a 35% increase in the money supply there‚Äôd be an increase of 35% inflation?\n\nNo. First of all, to state the obvious, there isn't.\n\nEverything else being equal and all new money going towards consumption, this would be the case. But everything else *isn't* equal.\n\nMonetary policy doesn't happen in a vacuum, significant changes are usually a response to a change in economic conditions. In this case, the increase was so substantial to avoid the *deflation* that would have occured thanks to the economic shock by the pandemic. You had a fall in output, a fall in how quickly money changed hands, and in response an increase in the money supply.\n\nNotable is also that behaviour in of itself matters. That's why central banks generally try to communicate their policy clearly and try to communicate policy changes ahead of time, so that expectations are in line with it. What people *believe* about inflation changes their actions and alters de facto inflation just as changes in the money supply do.\n\nUltimately in an economy you always have a mix of factors that push inflation up or down, the job of the central bank is to counteract these factors in order to reach their target of low and stable inflation. That's not always a perfect process, central bankers are neither wizards nor can they perfectly anticipate the future, but it does mean that \"why did the central bank alter the money supply\" is an important question to ask."}

{"question":"So my wife has been looking for part time work from home jobs to supplement my income. She found a virtual assistant position and applied.\n\nThe company offered her a position without interviewing her. It's for 6-7 hours a week making hotel and travel reservations. She will be paid $400 a week, and $30 extra per hour over 7 hours as needed.\n\nShe asked some questions and got an odd response that felt canned. Basically she said she would receive a check for $2950 that would cover the first week's pay, the cost of a printer and paper, as well as booking software.\n\nThis all feels like a scam, but I don't know how. Has anyone run into this? What should I be asking\/looking for?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the responses everyone. I should have phrased this a bit differently. I knew this was a scam, I just didn't know how. I appreciate all of the advice for legitimate work from home options.","answer":"This is 8000% a scam, and a very well-known one. Your wife will get a check and be told to cash it and then send $X to the \"printer company\" and keep the rest as her pay. There is no printer company. She is sending money to the scammer. The check will later bounce, and the bank will deduct the full $2950 from her account. She'll then be out the money that she sent for the \"printer,\" and possibly incur overdraft fees as well if it causes an overdraft.\n\nThe way this works is that the scammer uses a bad check, but that looks good enough to pass initial muster. It then gets credited to the account within X business days according to the bank's policy, but just because the money is available in your account doesn't mean a check has actually cleared. It takes a few weeks on the back end to make sure the check is legitimate and the account it's drawn on has sufficient funds to cover it, and once they realize it's no good they pull the money back from the account it was deposited in.\n\nTell her to run from this job, and she can report the person to the police if she wants to, though I doubt they'll actually catch them. In general, if it sounds too good to be true ($57\/hour for making travel reservations from home is *way* too good to be true), it usually is."}

{"question":"So, like most everybody else here, we are poor in basically every common meaning of the word.  It's ok, we have love and close relationships with our kids so we are generally happy.  This past june my daughter save her salary from her part time job for months to buy my wife something really nice for her birthday.  My daughter went out and bought my wife an expensive Michael Kors purse and wallet because: \"She always sacrificed for us to have what we needed, often going without for herself or giving up things she already had.\" in my daughters own words.  My wife cried when opening the gift and cherishes that purse and what it meant to her from her daughter.\n\nSo, yesterday while grocery shopping the lady behind her spotted the ebt card and the purse it just came out of.  She made a big scene and tried to take my wife's purse because \"poor people don't deserve expensive purses.\"  This failed spectacularly because my wife will always buckle her purse to the cart to prevent theft.  When the buckle was pulled tight the momentum the lady had started made her sprawl out on the floor.  So she just sat there shaming my wife before getting up and leaving.  Security was slow to respond and did basically nothing because no theft had actually occurred.\n\nSo now, my wife is ashamed to enjoy this gift from her daughter and wants to get rid of it.  It would be safe to say I'm more than a little bit pissed that a stranger took away one of the few things my wife has had that was just for her.\n\n**TLDR:** A stranger misjudged our situation and proceeded to shame and attempt steal my wifes things because \"poor people don't deserve nice things.\"","answer":"The problem with society is that they feel all poor people need to suffer.

{"question":"The S&amp;P 500 is almost exactly at the same place it was in January. The Dow hasn't recovered as well yet, but it is still at where it was in October. This is true despite COVID-19 preventing trillions of dollars in economic activity.\n\nI understand some of mechanisms used to fight the financial crisis in 2008 and how we are using them now. However this crisis seems to be totally different than 2008. The lost economic activity is directly from people not being able to work. It isn't value being lost on a balance sheet when investments fail. It isn't companies going into financial distress because they don't have the cash flow to continue operating. Those problems seem solvable by pumping extra money into the system to get through the temporary disturbances. This seems different. This is people literally not producing value and that lost value is never going to come back.\n\nHow is the stock market not reacting to this? Isn't this a sign that the stock market either was in a bubble previously, is in a bubble now, or is being propped up by huge inflation that is right around the corner?","answer":"&gt;How is the stock market not reacting to this?

{"question":"So I understand that Bidens tax plan will only affect individual incomes of over $400k, but what about the increase in corporate taxes? There's fear from the opposition that corporate taxes don't truly affect the corporation as much as it eventually affects the consumer. I guess I'm looking for a rebuttal to this point. I can totally envision a major multi million dollar company getting taxed more, but increasing their prices while finding more reasons to go offshore. Thanks and hoping for a prosperous presidency!","answer":"A detailed economic [analysis](https:\/\/budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu\/issues\/2020\/9\/14\/biden-2020-analysis) of the Biden platform was done at the Wharton Business School (Trump's alma mater, ironically), which said the following:\n\n&gt; Under the Biden tax plan, households with adjusted gross income (AGI) of $400,000 per year or less would not see their taxes increase directly but would see lower investment returns and wages as a result of corporate tax increases. Those with AGI at or below $400,000 would see an average decrease in after-tax income of 0.9 percent under the Biden tax plan, compared to a decrease of 17.7 percent for those with AGI above $400,000 (the top 1.5 percent).\n\nIt also summarizes the general impact of the Biden platform, finding that it would result in a reduced debt and increased GDP growth relative to the status quo:\n\n&gt; PWBM finds that over the 10-year budget window 2021 ‚Äì 2030, the Biden platform would raise $3.375 trillion in additional tax revenue and increase spending by $5.37 trillion. Including macroeconomic and health effects, by 2050 the Biden platform would decrease the federal debt by 6.1 percent and increase GDP by 0.8 percent relative to current law. Almost 80 percent of the increase in taxes under the Biden tax plan would fall on the top 1 percent of the income distribution.\n\nIn short, the Biden tax plan would result in slightly lower wages and returns on investment for those with incomes under $400,000, but would not directly increase their taxes. His platform would also reduce the national debt and boost GDP growth relative to Trump's policies. I hope that answers the question."}

All that wouln't really be a  problem if Russia would amass debts like any other country - but I can  hardly see anyone willing to lend them money to rebuild their army?\n\nTLDR: The numbers above seem to align with articels like [this](https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/article-10554269\/Ukraine-DESTROYS-Russian-convoy-Zelenskys-troops-derail-Kremlin-push-Kyiv.html),  claiming the war is over after 10 days. But the majority of news claim  the sanctions don't hurt Russia (shortterm) and the war might go on for a  long time still. How is that possible?","answer":"Russia is semi self sufficient. They‚Äôre one of the worlds largest producers of both grain and energy. Food and fuel and state control of many industries means they can probably last longer than most countries would with their currency in the state it‚Äôs in. \n\nBut the situation in the long and medium term for Russia is still very bleak. I cannot see any scenario where they achieve any measure of victory in Ukraine. Almost The entire world is United in opposition of their invasion, that some means the world won‚Äôt allow Ukraine to cease to exist (in the way say Poland was partitioned during WWII). And the strength the Ukrainian people have shown tells me that they will never surrender and never stop fighting now matter how long Russia remains there. \n\nMost data points to Russia not having the manpower to sustain an occupation of the country. Assuming that‚Äôs out the window, Russia can only try to achieve a decisive victory. They want to depose Zelenskyy. I think they‚Äôd like to have a pro Russian government installed but short of that I think Putin would settle for a Ukraine that is unstable and in a state of civil war\/reconstruction with no economic, military, or otherwise capacity to join nato or the EU. \n\nEven if Russia achieves some measure of victory, they will only have achieved destroying themselves and Ukraine in the process. Their economy is gonna be fucked for a decade to come at least whether putin is still there or not in the years to come. There‚Äôs no way out of this for Russia short of them internally eliminating putin and pulling all forces from Ukraine immediately"}
{"question":"I've read almost all of the books on the \/r\/economics reading list (64 of 70). I've also read and studied Mankiw's Principles of Economics. Compared to a reasonably smart and accomplished undergrad at a state school, how much do I know and have yet to learn at the undergrad level?\n\nI ask because in the long run, I'm interested in maybe getting a masters or maybe even pursuing a doctorate (if I can get into a top 40 school) in Economics.","answer":"Math skills and familiarity with the intermediate micro\/macro\/metrics coursework are far more important for grad school admissions than the pop economics books on that reading list.\n\n\\-Former PhD candidate"}
{"question":"The posts are getting more and more ridiculous.\n\n&gt; Rate my medium risk portfolio, it is 70% crypto, weed, NASDAQ, eSports, clean energy, and videogaming, with some junk bonds for the safe part. I know past performance is not an indicator of future gains. My strategy is to double my initial investment in five years.\n\nThis is a personal finance subreddit, not a gambling community, and bullshit like this should be shot down. Instead we have a bunch of newly arrived shoeshine boys upvoting and encouraging each other and giving each other genius tips like \"Clean energy is the future and lots of people do weed so they will outperform the market\". \n\nThis is concerning and dangerous for the people involved. Not sure what can be done about it. \n\nBut I know what is not ok. Looking at the people who understand what is going on but write something to the effect of \"Well, maybe do 20% crypto instead of 45%\". Recommending moderation in gambling is just enabling gambling.\n\nMy 0.02‚Ç¨ worth of opinion.","answer":"All the new people that are entering the market are only seeing the massive gain posts. Combined with that we have a massive bull market and you can make money with pretty much anything. When those new people arrive, they may learn a bit more and hear about how safe ETFs are and that they pretty much guarantee you good returns based on the last few years. So they will basically still YOLO just with ETFs which seem like they have no risk :)"}
{"question":"When I (27M) was growing up my father made about 100k\/ year working in a mine. He had multiple houses big boats. I have always tried to follow in his footsteps by always being the hardest working, and taking hard jobs most won‚Äôt do that will pay more but it isn‚Äôt enough. Now people are getting wealthy from the easiest jobs like sitting on your computer or whatever. I would really appreciate some advice because I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I have had a family for a couple years and we are barely getting by. I make 26 an hour right now but with inflation I had to get sent money for gas  just to get to work today. I have been full time at my job for 2 years. I try to budget and I can‚Äôt remember the last time I actually got myself anything. I feel like a failure to my family and I‚Äôm doing the best I can. I need to learn modern ways of making money, this is not how I want to spend my life. \n\nTLDR: old ways of making money are dead please show me the way.","answer":"If there's a way to make money there's already a billionaire who has 2 or 3 companies working on a way to get in that market easier, faster, with lower prices, etc. Not much opportunity for us common folk"}
{"question":"We are all on the same team. Everyone wants to make money in the end. It's a zero sum game. The difference is the risk-return tradeoff. \nThere are many on this sub who use a combination of multiple strategies(buying &amp; selling options). \nWe all have gotten burned on crazy unexpected moves in several underlyings, when the other side won bigly or vice-versa. \nIt's like making a good income on a 9-5 job but feeling jealous because someone made it big with the risk they took in their business or laughing at them when their business goes to shit. \n\nPeople acting as if their strategies as superior to others. This will just demotivate newcomers from learning","answer":"It isn't just the bad trade that's worth criticizing WSB for. It's for the sheer amount of literal conspiracy theories spewing out of there. It's like the qanon of finance now. \n\nIf it was filled with people who realized they made a bad trade you would have a point. But even now it's people spamming bullshit memes and attacking anyone who tries to argue anything different. It's basically devolved into a cult."}
{"question":"Starting a new remote role as a staff sde in big tech in a few weeks. This role will likely be more responsibility than my last but also a lot more pay.\n\nI was wondering if any fatfirees made similar amounts at moderately demanding jobs on their way to the top, and what you did to optimize your time and wellbeing? I've always been the kind of person to do everything myself, but some of my coworkers have really leaned into paying others for almost everything so they can purely focus on their craft\/job.\n\nThings I've been thinking of:\n\n* Personal Trainer \n\n* Nutritionist \/ Meal Service\n\n* Cleaning service\n\n* Good Ergonomic Desk \/ Chair setup\n\n* Good Vacations\n\nCurious to hear people's thoughts! Thanks","answer":"I'm a therapist and my patients are mainly \"fatfire\" people. Them being patients, I obviously have the ultimate selection bias. Yet: What I find is that those who lean too much into this logic of optimization are the ones that suffer from a (literal) maddening degree of alienation.\n\nIt's an easy trap to fall into as it is so very *sensible*: Why would you spend six hours cleaning (doing a chore you hate and doing it badly) if you could just work an additional hour and outsource that? So you hire a cleaner. And a cook, a personal shopper, an interior designer and a nanny. But if you don't watch out, all your little self worth eggs, so to speak, are kept in the same work basket - and, step by step, you start to live the life of a stranger. You eat the food of someone else, wear the clothes of not-you, in an apartment that might as well be a hotel room, with kids that are more attached to their nanny than to you. Your vacations are glamorous, but there's little connection to anyone or anything in them. At this point you might start to feel a little unease. You might start to wonder why you're unfulfilled and try to treat yourself better - so you double down. You get a PA because dealing with a schedule is annoying, you get a personal trainer because *mens sana in corpore sano* and while you're at it, you also start therapy, where you learn techniques that help somewhat and where you analyze childhood events. But what somehow is kept at bay, in a fish-not-having-a-word-for-water-way, is that you identify with your job of optimizing processes to maximum efficency to a degree that you treat yourself like any work project. What I am getting at here is: Watch out. It may be easier and more worth it to develop an interest in cooking or join a sports club or a gym that you like. But also: Screw cleaning."}
