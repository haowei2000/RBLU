Penalty for noncompliance is, well, into five figures. The notices are cheap, and I don't mind paying for them if I have to have them. But I honestly don't even know how or where to post them, especially since I have no office and no employees to see them. Do I really need to do this? If not, am I supposed to tell someone that I have no employees, or what?"

2,"Need medical advice/explanation for English story plot.TW - underaged abuse, rape &amp; incest
Sorry, new to Reddit &amp; don’t really know how to work the app nor know any other subreddit that is specified to the advice I need. But if there is one, could someone pls direct me to it, cheers.

But my story includes a 17 year old girl who is raped by her uncle and as a result, gives birth to a daughter. The daughter, now an adult (around mid-20s) is unaware of this and develops infertility issues (since research does indicate that offspring of inbreeding are more prone to fertility complications) and is set on finding the root of this problem.

And here comes my questions…
- How, biologically, does inbred genes impact a woman (or general person’s) fertility - or like, if a doctor was to explain to her why and how her parents being related impacts her ability to conceive, how would they explain this?
- if she went to a doctor, what kind of general fertility tests would they run on her?
- If she went to a doctor and took genetic testing, would it suggest her parents are related? (without DNA samples from her parents and strictly her own).

I struggled to find answers when researching, so any ideas to any question is deeply appreciated -
Or if I’m asking questions unrelated to the intended content of the subreddit, I’m happy to be redirected elsewhere.

Thanks :)"

7,"Can a credit card company garnish my wages 7 years later, without having you served or notified of court date?.10 years ago we were in terrible financial shape.  We lost our home in a foreclosure, my husband got fired and I tried to work with Discover to reduce payments because every payment went only to an insanely high interest rate (opened card at 2.9% but after late payments they increased it to over 20%) but they wouldn't work with me and I couldn't afford to pay them.  

I swore I received a letter about 3 years ago saying they were no longer seeking payments, it was dropped.  I have been working on increasing my credit score and getting my life back financially.

I just received word from my payroll department that Discover wants to garnish my wages.  

Back story:

There was a case filed in Florida 9 years ago wo (where I haven't lived in 7 years). I had not received anything from Discover about it.  They garnished a big chunk out of my bank account in 2012 and said the courts deemed that was enough and they closed the case.

Well they decided to reopen it and ask for more money a year later...I again never heard about any of this.  They went back and forth requesting more payments, and served my payroll department since they never served me.

Can they settle on one amount and then reopen the case years later and demand more?

I am the primary wage earner in my house.  I make $55K a year (before taxes) and have 2 kids under 18 and 2 over 21 still living at home.  Our medical insurance alone costs me $12K/year before copays and deductibles, so figure I spend $15K/year on insurance, leaving me $40K (before taxes) to live on.

I am freaking out!  My husband has been unemployed for 2 years and is in school to hopefully be able to get a job.

We had a much better life financially then he lost his job and everything went to pot after that.

I am a wreck right now.  I can't go to Florida...I don't even know when the court date is.  I just had my spine fused 10 weeks ago and had to go back to work 2 weeks after surgery because that is all of the vacation/PTO time I had.

Should I file bankruptcy?  Fuck...I am just a crying mess right now!

Could we instead have a monotonically increasing function mathematical function that determines the tax rate, whose integral would then be the amount of money owed. with f(x) being the share of a dollar that would be owed to government and x being the number of the dollar.

My suggestion is 

f(x)=((25000)/(-(x+62500)))+0.4

this would mean that the tax revenue would be about the same as it is today. The maximum tax rate would converge on 40% and start at about 0%.

The total amount of money you would owe would be the integral of the function which in this case would be 

f(x)=−25000ln(|x+62500|)+0.4(x+62500)+251073"

They told me the invoice number the request related to had been paid in full and to not worry about it anymore. They would deal with it from there, please accept our apologies and ignore any further communications from Nuffield etc.

I’m not particularly prepared to ignore this final demand, so I’m drafting an email with evidence to their team as we speak and will call them first thing tomorrow. 

My question is, can I include anything in my email regarding this now being harassment to force them to stop on a legal basis? Im extremely worried this will affect my credit rating as I will be starting the process of purchasing a house very soon. 

The email states it will go to their debt collectors 5 days from the date of their letter (19/04) - is this the point it will affect my credit rating or will it already have had an affect?

If it has, is there any legal recourse for me to have this reversed or have either Nuffield or AXA compensate me for the possible loss I may incur when trying to purchase a house?

27,"Was the rise of 401(k)s a boost to the stock market? And has that boost evaporated?.I'm not an economics or finance person.  This is mostly just a shower thought that I was unable to answer with a few minutes of googling so I figured I'd ask here:

In my mind, for the first couple centuries or so of US stock markets, stocks were bought and sold by traditional investors (institutions and savvy and/or rich individuals).  I'll call that the Classical Era.

The Early 401(k) Era seems like a sea change to me - starting in the late 70s and then really picking up in the early 80s, money poured into the stock market on behalf of a huge number of American workers.  With every payroll, institutions would buy, buy, buy on behalf of 401(k) holders.  Certainly there was some selling, but relatively little, especially early on as there hadn't been time for large 401(k) balances to accumulate.  Coincidentally(?), the stock market (from glancing at a chart or 2) appears to have performed better from 1980-date than over most time periods.

Now it seems to me that perhaps we're hitting the 401(k) Equilibrium Era, where money continues to pour into the market on behalf of workers, but there are also now plenty of 401(k) retirees selling constantly as well.

Is it reasonable to think that the Early 401(k) Era was a ""turbo boost"" for the market, but in the 401(k) Equilibrium Era we might expect future stock market returns to look more like in the Classical Era?"

The wikipedia page for defunct major us airlines is quite extensive. Each airline now defunct seems to have suffered a similar fate of a merger or going bankrupt and then being absorbed by a larger airline.

I’m starting a research paper on this topic and I was looking to gain some insight. Here are my questions:

Disregarding post 9/11 security measures, has air travel become easier and quicker since the mid 2000s when an oligopoly became more apparent?

Airplanes have become more advanced, but how has service changed for better or worse as more airlines disappeared?

Is this a natural economic phenomenon? Has this happened in other nations with a large number of airlines?

What are the positives if any of the airline industry being an oligopoly? Does it make more itineraries possible, accomidate for more needs, and lower the cost of travel?

When the government regulated prices, what were the positives and negatives of this?

68,"High inflation in the next decade?.Hi guys,

A follow up to my previous question:

The FED seems to predict the terminal rate to be 2.5% which will occur in 2025.

I’m curious to know what are economists thoughts on this.

To me, inflation may very well stay high this decade necessitating a higher terminal rate.

Justification

Low inflation this decade was fueled in great part by:

1. Globalization of labour into labour cheap countries like China lowering production costs. This seems to be shifting back due to protection against supply shocks and increasing political polarization. 

2. Low energy prices. This seems not set to continue with quasi-monopoly OPEC seeking to maintain their oil sovereignty/supremacy over the world with production cuts and what not. Further, we are nowhere near completing the clean energy transition to move away from these authoritarian oil regimes. Further, this transition which likely will take a decade plus may be inflationary in and of itself. It costs money to create the clean energy economy as well as commodities which may increase in price due to higher demand.

3. Cheap money. Many have made a lot of money in real estate over the years thanks to cheap debt increasing demand for housing. Those that sold have lots of liquidity and savings and will therefore be highly *not* sensitive to increased rate hikes necessitating further hikes.

Is this the great inflation decade 2.0?

Are we underestimating these structural forces in the long run?

Thanks, Rick"

70,"Is FDI stock the same as the total amount of capital invested by a country in a given period?.&amp;#x200B;

Hi AskEconomics - really appreciate some help on this one, as i'm not an economist and i'm getting lost in the weeds trying to understand something.

What I am trying to do is obtain *annual* FDI (by sector) in and out of the US. I've found this data on the Bureau of Economic Analysis' website; however, i can't make sense of what the different datasets are. For example, I see that there is a set based on FDI stock (Balance of Payments - Position, on a historical cost basis). Does a stock position mean the total value of accumulated FDI in that year? Or is this the amount of capital that has been invested? Could someone please explain the concepts of ""stock"" and ""direct investment position""?

These are the sets I'm looking at:

75,"Why is pollution not factored in as a cost by consumers?. So, I asked a while ago about cigarettes.

Basically the thinking was, if a rational consumer is smoking a cigarette, wouldn't the long term health costs factor into their decision to smoke? I.e. the full cost of smoking is going to be borne by the smoker (apart from second hand smoke, which is a solid example of an externality). The balance between short term utility and long term health costs will influence the decision on what quantity of cigarettes to smoke right?

So, take a power plant. A power plant tends to pollute the local area which it services. Wouldn't rational consumers factor in the costs of pollution when consuming power, because it is they who bear the cost. This is going to affect demand right? Because the consumer must have enough left over after using power to account for the health costs associated with pollution.

A pigouvian tax works whether applied to consumer or producer right? So if the cost of production is borne by the consumer here, wouldn't that affect the demand for power, which in turn will influence the price at which it is supplied (the demand curve would shift left relative to if the consumers didn't bear the cost of pollution right?)

So the cost of pollution isn't borne by the polluter, but it is borne by the consumer, and that influences demand does it not? Isn't this similar to the case of cigarettes? Is a pigouvian tax needed here, and if so, why is the influence on demand insufficient to proper allocation of resources?"

I am trying to create a simple excel model to figure out what car to purchase in the future given the number of months I plan on keeping it and the estimated monthly miles I will put on it.

It seems simple, but there are a few things I think I am doing wrong in terms of calculating the total cost of ownership over the months I plan on owning one of them. For some reason I think I am getting a couple things wrong, like the number of periods over the \~36 months.

What I am trying to do is use this as a way to perform a sensitivity analysis to say ""If I only plan on owning the car for X number of months at I miles per month, option Y is my best option to reduce the total cost of ownership"".

Aaron (A) and Bruce (B) live in New York City in a duplex right next to each other. They get in a heated argument one day outside their houses. Bruce smugly goes inside thinking that he’s won the argument and has the last word. Aaron is so angry that he throws a rock through the window of Bruce’s side of the duplex.
Bruce sues Aaron for the window and the two end up in court the following week.
The judge finds Aaron guilty of destruction of property (or whatever the charges for breaking the window would be) and gives Aaron a choice:
Aaron can either:
- Have whatever the regular sentence would be for breaking Bruce’s window

OR

- Get his own window broken by Bruce.
Bruce would be escorted by an officer over to the duplex and Bruce will be given an opportunity to break Aaron’s window.

In many ways shipping seems more like infrastructure than a service. Huge upfront cost, minimal labor to opperate. Transportation infrastructure is generally supported by the higher levels of government, for the purpose of boosting ecomomic growth.

Or why is less incentive given compared to alternative modes."
91,"How to increase the standards of living for the middle class?.I know the question at first sounds basic, but please read further. I know that increasing real GDP per capita has a very high correlation with the increase in standards of living of the middle class, and that the only way to increase real GDP per capita is to increase productivity. However, despite having economics classes, I'm still confused partly because of the considerable productivity-pay gap that we have witnessed in the last decades.

What matters to the middle class is, I assume, the percentage of these ""productivity gains"" that they can retain. Increased productivity does not benefit at all the middle class if these gains end up to those who owns the means of productions, i.e., generally wealthy people (Note: Please ignore for the sake of simplification the fact that some of the productivity gains to the wealthy go back to the government in the form of capital gains tax for example, higher property taxes, etc., and that the government eventually more-or-less redistributes wealth among the middle class).

My question is more-or-less the following: for the middle class to see an increase in their standards of living, what does it take? My hypothesis is that the only way for the average worker to see their standards of living go up is to have their wage increase proportionally to the CPI, aka their wage goes up but CPI remains the same, or their wage goes higher relative to the CPI in a set period of time. Please let me know if I'm wrong.

I had gone from 185 to 238 and they worsened some other problems I've had with my heart rate. Since stopping I haven't been feeling anxious or depressed. I'm not sure if the weight loss is related to anxiety, depression, or stopping those medications.

98,"Would this be considered malpractice? [MO, USA].I'm sorry for the long story, but I need to know how serious this is. This is the simplest I can make the story of my boyfriend (H) being discharged from the hospital today.
H has a pretty serious alcohol addiction, despite only being 20. His father just died a month and a half ago, drank himself to death (this part is important later.)
His mother (K) and I brought H to the ER on Christmas morning. He hadn't eaten or slept in 3 days, was starting to hallucinate, and had a seizure in the middle of the night Christmas Eve. He was throwing up anything that he swallowed (yes, even the alcohol) so we knew he was suffering withdrawals badly.
We saw his Dr twice in the whole 3.5 days we were there, and he only spent a maximum of 3 minutes in the room both those times. He was very short and seemed not to care about the pain H was going through. But I know how hospitals work, I knew the nurses were going to be the ones actually providing his care and monitoring him, so I let it go.
We spen 2.5 days in the ICU, and get moved out to a regular room in the afternoon. He's on a benzo and a librium taper still after the ICU, and we're expecting to be there at least another 2 days.
Dr walks in (K isn't there so it's just me and a benzed out H,) looks in his general direction for 3 seconds and goes ""ready to go home?""
We're shocked, but yes he does want to go home and we want him home. Discharge paperwork is all done up and we get him to the car and head home. Great! But no...
As soon as K leaves to get his Librium prescription, H looks just like he did before the hospital. Shaky, sweaty, crying from pain. We know for sure he wasn't tapered off his medication all the way.
K comes home with his prescription and asks me about everything Dr did and said when he gave us the OK. I tell her he really didn't say anything except for (and I quote) ""Stop drinking. Sorry your dad died but downing bottles won't bring him back.""
When K was at the pharmacy, she noticed the paper she was given with his discharge paperwork wasn't a prescription. In bolded capital letters on the bottom it said ""this is not a prescription- do not refill."" 
It was also only half the amount of pills the nurse had told us would be needed to taper him at home.
What Dr did not know was that K was ALSO A DOCTOR! So she corrected the prescription, also got him the benzo since the hospital was basically making him go almost cold-turkey. She also told us he was supposed to do a neurological and physical  exam on him to make sure he was SAFE to be at home. Dr never saw H out of bed so he definitely did not know if he could walk on his own yet. 
K was pissed and she went back to the hospital to speak to him, but Dr had left. When she finally got him on the phone and explained how much he screwed up, that was when he helped her correct everything. Of course K is still going to take it to the insurance company and file a complaint with the hospital, and when she told Dr this he said ""oh let's be reasonable now.""
With how severe H's body goes through withdrawals, and how fried his mind is already from this weeks experience, another seizure could kill him right now. If H did not have Mama Doctor, I wouldn't have known how many steps were missed.
